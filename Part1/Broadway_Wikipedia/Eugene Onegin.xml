Onegin is considered a classic of <ref target="/wiki/Russian_literature" title="Russian literature">Russian literature</ref>, and its <ref target="/wiki/Eponym" title="Eponym">eponymous</ref> protagonist has served as the model for a number of Russian literary heroes (so-called <ref target="/wiki/Superfluous_man" title="Superfluous man">superfluous men</ref>). It was published in serial form between 1825 and 1832. The first complete edition was published in 1833, and the currently accepted version is based on the 1837 publication.</p>
<p>Almost the entire work is made up of 389 fourteen-line <ref target="/wiki/Stanza" title="Stanza">stanzas</ref> (5,446 lines in all) of <ref target="/wiki/Iambic_tetrameter" title="Iambic tetrameter">iambic tetrameter</ref> with the unusual <ref target="/wiki/Rhyme_scheme" title="Rhyme scheme">rhyme scheme</ref> "AbAbCCddEffEgg", where the uppercase letters represent <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Feminine_rhyme" title="Feminine rhyme">feminine rhymes</ref> while the lowercase letters represent <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Masculine_rhyme" title="Masculine rhyme">masculine rhymes</ref>. This form has come to be known as the "<ref target="/wiki/Onegin_stanza" title="Onegin stanza">Onegin stanza</ref>" or the "Pushkin sonnet." The innovative rhyme scheme, the natural tone and diction, and the economical transparency of presentation all demonstrate the virtuosity which has been instrumental in proclaiming Pushkin as the undisputed master of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Russian_poetry" title="Russian poetry">Russian poetry</ref>.</p>
<p>The story is told by a narrator (a lightly fictionalized version of Pushkin's public image), whose tone is educated, worldly, and intimate. The narrator digresses at times, usually to expand on aspects of this social and intellectual world. This narrative style allows for a development of the characters and emphasizes the drama of the plot despite its relative simplicity. The book is admired for the artfulness of its verse narrative as well as for its exploration of life, death, love, ennui, convention, and passion.</p>

<h2>Plot[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Eugene_Onegin&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Plot">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>In the 1820s, Eugene Onegin is a bored St. Petersburg <ref target="/wiki/Dandy" title="Dandy">dandy</ref>, whose life consists of balls, concerts, parties, and nothing more. Upon the death of a wealthy uncle, he inherits a substantial fortune and a landed estate. When he moves to the country, he strikes up a friendship with his neighbor, a starry-eyed young poet named Vladimir Lensky. Lensky takes Onegin to dine with the family of his fiancée, the sociable but rather thoughtless Olga Larina. At this meeting, he also catches a glimpse of Olga's sister Tatyana. A quiet, precocious romantic, and the exact opposite of Olga, Tatyana becomes intensely drawn to Onegin. Soon after, she bares her soul to Onegin in a letter professing her love. Contrary to her expectations, Onegin does not write back. When they meet in person, he rejects her advances politely but dismissively and condescendingly. This famous speech is often referred to as Onegin's Sermon: he admits that the letter was touching, but says that he would quickly grow bored with marriage and can only offer Tatyana friendship; he coldly advises more emotional control in the future, lest another man take advantage of her innocence.</p>

<p>Later, Lensky mischievously invites Onegin to Tatyana's <ref target="/wiki/Name_day" title="Name day">name day</ref> celebration, promising a small gathering with just Tatyana, Olga, and their parents. When Onegin arrives, he finds instead a boisterous country ball, a rural parody of and contrast to the society balls of St. Petersburg of which he has grown tired. Onegin is irritated with the guests who gossip about him and Tatyana, and with Lensky for persuading him to come. He decides to avenge himself by dancing and flirting with Olga. Olga is insensitive to her fiancé and apparently attracted to Onegin. Earnest and inexperienced, Lensky is wounded to the core and challenges Onegin to fight a duel; Onegin reluctantly accepts, feeling compelled by social convention. During the duel, Onegin unwillingly kills Lensky. Afterwards, he quits his country estate, traveling abroad to deaden his feelings of remorse.</p>
<p>Tatyana visits Onegin's mansion, where she looks through his books and his notes in the margins, and begins to question whether Onegin's character is merely a collage of different literary heroes, and if there is, in fact, no "real Onegin". Tatyana, still brokenhearted by the loss of Onegin, is convinced by her parents to live with her aunt in Moscow in order to find a suitor.</p>
<p>Several years pass, and the scene shifts to St. Petersburg. Onegin has come to attend the most prominent balls and interact with the leaders of old Russian society. He sees the most beautiful woman, who captures the attention of all and is central to society's whirl, and he realizes that it is the same Tatyana whose love he had once spurned. Now she is married to an aged prince (a general). Upon seeing Tatyana again, he becomes obsessed with winning her affection, despite the fact that she is married. However, his attempts are rebuffed. He writes her several letters, but receives no reply. Eventually Onegin manages to see Tatyana and offers her the opportunity to finally elope after they have become reacquainted. She recalls the days when they might have been happy, but concludes that that time has passed. Onegin repeats his love for her. Faltering for a moment, she admits that she still loves him, but she will not allow him to ruin her and declares her determination to remain faithful to her husband. She leaves him regretting his bitter destiny.</p>

<p>One of the main themes of Eugene Onegin is the relationship between fiction and real life. People are often shaped by art, and the work is packed with allusions to other major literary works.</p>
<p>Another major element is Pushkin's creation of a woman of intelligence and depth in Tatyana, whose vulnerable sincerity and openness on the subject of love has made her the heroine of countless Russian women, despite her apparent naïveté. Pushkin, in the final chapter, fuses his Muse and Tatyana's new 'form' in society after a lengthy description of how she has guided him in his works.</p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Pushkin_Selfportrait_with_Onegin.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Pushkin_Selfportrait_with_Onegin.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>A sketch by Pushkin of himself and Onegin lounging in St. Petersburg
<p>Perhaps the darkest theme – despite the light touch of the narration – is Pushkin's presentation of the deadly inhumanity of social convention. Onegin is its bearer in this work. His induction into selfishness, vanity, and indifference occupies the introduction, and he is unable to escape it when he moves to the country. His inability to relate to the feelings of others and his entire lack of empathy – the cruelty instilled in him by the "world" – is epitomized in the very first stanza of the first book by his stunningly self-centered thoughts about being with the dying uncle whose estate he is to inherit:</p>

<p>"But God how deadly dull to sample</p>
<p>sickroom attendance night and day</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>and sighing ask oneself all through</p>
<p>"When will the devil come for you?"<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>However, the "devil comes for Onegin" when he both literally and figuratively kills innocence and sincerity in shooting Lensky in the duel and rejecting Tatyana. Tatyana learns her lesson: armored against feelings and steeped in convention, she crushes his later sincerity and remorse. (This epic reversal of roles, and the work's broad social perspectives, provide ample justification for its subtitle "a novel in verse".)</p>
<p>Tatyana's nightmare illustrates the concealed aggression of the "world". In the dream, she is chased over a frozen winter landscape by a terrifying bear (representing the ferocity of Onegin's inhuman persona) and confronted by demons and goblins in a hut she hopes will provide shelter. This nightmare is contrasted to the open vitality of the "real" people at the country ball, giving dramatic emphasis to the war of warm human feelings against the chilling artificiality of society.</p>
<p>Thus, Onegin has lost his love, killed his only friend, and found no satisfaction in his life. He is a victim of his own pride and selfishness. He is doomed to loneliness, and this is his tragedy.</p>
<p>The conflict between art and life was no mere fiction in Russia, but is in fact illustrated by Pushkin's own fate: he too was killed in a duel, falling victim to the social conventions of Russian high society.</p>

<h2>Composition and publication[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Eugene_Onegin&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Composition and publication">edit</ref>]</h2>
<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Onegin3.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Onegin3.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>Onegin proposes to Tatiana, late 19th century illustration by <ref target="/wiki/Pavel_Sokolov_(painter)" title="Pavel Sokolov (painter)">Pavel Sokolov</ref>
<p>As with many other 19th century <ref target="/wiki/Novel" title="Novel">novels</ref>, Onegin was written and published <ref target="/wiki/Serial_(literature)" title="Serial (literature)">serially</ref>, with parts of each chapter often appearing in magazines before the first printing of each chapter. Many changes, some small and some large, were made from the first appearance to the final edition during Pushkin's lifetime. The following dates mostly come from Nabokov's study of the photographs of Pushkin's drafts that were available at the time, as well as other people's work on the subject.</p>
<p>The first stanza of chapter 1 was started on May 9, 1823, and except for three stanzas (XXXIII, XVIII, and XIX), the chapter was finished on October 22. The remaining stanzas were completed and added to his notebook by the first week of October 1824. Chapter 1 was first published as a whole in a booklet on February 16, 1825, with a foreword which suggests that Pushkin had no clear plan on how (or even whether) he would continue the novel.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 was started on October 22, 1823 (the date when most of chapter 1 had been finished), and finished by December 8, except for stanzas XL and XXXV, which were added sometime over the next three months. The first separate edition of chapter 2 appeared on October 20, 1826.</p>
<p>Many events occurred which interrupted the writing of chapter 3. In January 1824, Pushkin stopped work on Onegin to work on <ref target="/wiki/The_Gypsies_(poem)" title="The Gypsies (poem)">The Gypsies</ref>. Except for XXV, stanzas I–XXXI were added on September 25, 1824. Nabokov guesses that Tatyana's Letter was written in <ref target="/wiki/Odessa" title="Odessa">Odessa</ref> between February 8 and May 31, 1824. Pushkin incurred the displeasure of the Tsarist regime in Odessa and was restricted to his family estate Mikhaylovskoye in <ref target="/wiki/Pskov" title="Pskov">Pskov</ref> for two years. He left Odessa on July 21, 1824, and arrived on August 9. Writing resumed on September 5, and chapter 3 was finished (apart from stanza XXXVI) on October 2. The first separate publication of chapter 3 was on October 10, 1827.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 was started in October 1824. By the end of the year, Pushkin had written 23 stanzas and had reached XXVII by January 5, 1825, at which point he started writing stanzas for Onegin's Journey and worked on other pieces of writing. He thought that it was finished on September 12, 1825, but later continued the process of rearranging, adding, and omitting stanzas until the first week of 1826. The first separate edition of chapter 4 appeared with chapter 5 in a publication produced between January 31 and February 2, 1828.</p>
<p>The writing of chapter 5 began on January 4, 1826, and 24 stanzas were complete before the start of his trip to petition the Tsar for his freedom. He left for this trip on September 4 and returned on November 2, 1826. He completed the rest of the chapter in the week November 15 to 22, 1826. The first separate edition of chapter 5 appeared with chapter 4 in a publication produced between January 31 and February 2, 1828.</p>
<p>When Nabokov carried out his study on the writing of Onegin, the manuscript of chapter 6 was lost, but it is known that Pushkin started chapter 6 before finishing chapter 5. Most of chapter 6 appears to have been written before the beginning of December 19, 1826 when Pushkin returned to Moscow after exile on his family estate. Many stanzas appeared to have been written between November 22 and 25, 1826. On March 23, 1828, the first separate edition of chapter 6 was published.</p>
<p>Pushkin started writing chapter 7 in March 1827, but aborted his original plan for the plot of the chapter and started on a different tack, completing the chapter on November 4, 1828. The first separate edition of chapter 7 was first printed on March 18, 1836.</p>
<p>Pushkin intended to write a chapter called "Onegin's Journey", which occurred between the events of chapters 7 and 8, and in fact was supposed to be the eighth chapter. Fragments of this incomplete chapter were published, in the same way that parts of each chapter had been published in magazines before each chapter was first published in a separate edition. When Pushkin completed chapter 8, he published it as the final chapter and included within its denouement the line nine cantos I have written, still intending to complete this missing chapter. When Pushkin finally decided to abandon this chapter, he removed parts of the ending to fit with the change.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 was begun before December 24, 1829, while Pushkin was in St. Petersburg. In August 1830, he went to <ref target="/wiki/Boldino" title="Boldino">Boldino</ref> (the Pushkin family estate)<ref target="#cite_note-2">[2]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> where, due to an epidemic of <ref target="/wiki/Cholera" title="Cholera">cholera</ref>, he was forced to stay for three months. During this time, he produced what Nabokov describes as an "incredible number of masterpieces" and finished copying out chapter 8 on September 25, 1830. During the summer of 1831, Pushkin revised and completed chapter 8 apart from "Onegin's Letter", which was completed on October 5, 1831. The first separate edition of chapter 8 appeared on January 10, 1832.</p>
<p>Pushkin wrote at least 18 stanzas of a never-completed tenth chapter. It contained many satires and even direct criticism on contemporary Russian rulers, including the <ref target="/wiki/Nicholas_I_of_Russia" title="Nicholas I of Russia">Emperor himself</ref>. Afraid of being prosecuted for dissidence, Pushkin burnt most of the tenth chapter. Very little of it survived in Pushkin's notebooks.<ref target="#cite_note-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>The first complete edition of the book was published in 1833. Slight corrections were made by Pushkin for the 1837 edition. The standard accepted text is based on the 1837 edition with a few changes due to the Tsar's censorship restored.</p>

<h2>The duel[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Eugene_Onegin&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: The duel">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>In Pushkin's time, the early 19th century, <ref target="/wiki/Duel" title="Duel">duels</ref> were very strictly regulated. A second's primary duty was to prevent the duel from actually happening, and only when both combatants were unwilling to stand down were they to make sure that the duel proceeded according to formalised rules.<ref target="#cite_note-Lotman_duel-5">[5]</ref> A challenger's second should therefore always ask the challenged party if he wants to apologise for the actions that have led to the challenge.</p>
<p>In Eugene Onegin, Lensky's second, Zaretsky, does not ask Onegin even once if he would like to apologise, and because Onegin is not allowed to apologise on his own initiative, the duel takes place, with fatal consequences. Zaretsky is described as "classical and pedantic in duels" (chapter 6, stanza XXVI), and this seems very out of character for a nobleman. Zaretsky's first chance to end the duel is when he delivers Lensky's written challenge to Onegin (chapter 6, stanza IX). Instead of asking Onegin if he would like to apologise, he apologises for having much to do at home and leaves as soon as Onegin (obligatorily) accepts the challenge.</p>
<p>On the day of the duel, Zaretsky gets several more chances to prevent the duel from happening. Because dueling was forbidden in the <ref target="/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</ref>, duels were always held at dawn. Zaretsky urges Lensky to get ready shortly after 6 o'clock in the morning (chapter 6, stanza XXIII), while the sun only rises at 20 past 8, because he expects Onegin to be on time. However, Onegin oversleeps (chapter 6, stanza XXIV), and arrives on the scene more than an hour late.<ref target="#cite_note-Lotman_duel-5">[5]</ref> According to the dueling codex, if a duelist arrives more than 15 minutes late, he automatically forfeits the duel.<ref target="#cite_note-Dueling_codex-6">[6]</ref> Lensky and Zaretsky have been waiting all that time (chapter 6, stanza XXVI), even though it was Zaretsky's duty to proclaim Lensky as winner and take him home.</p>
<p>When Onegin finally arrives, Zaretsky is supposed to ask him a final time if he would like to apologise. Instead, Zaretsky is surprised by the apparent absence of Onegin's second. Onegin, against all rules, appoints his servant Guillot as his second (chapter 6, stanza XXVII), a blatant insult for the nobleman Zaretsky.<ref target="#cite_note-Lotman_duel-5">[5]</ref> Zaretsky angrily accepts Guillot as Onegin's second. By his actions, Zaretsky does not act as a nobleman should; in the end Onegin wins the duel.<ref target="#cite_note-Lotman_duel-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>Onegin himself, however, tried as he could to prevent the fatal outcome, and killed Lensky unwillingly and almost by accident. As the first shooter, he couldn't show that he was deliberately trying to miss the opponent, because this was considered as a serious insult and could create a formal reason to appoint another duel. Instead, he tried to minimize his chances of hitting Lensky by shooting without precise aiming, from the maximal possible distance, not even trying to come closer and get a clear shot.<ref target="#cite_note-Lotman_duel-5">[5]</ref></p>

<p>Translators of Eugene Onegin have all had to adopt a trade-off between precision and preservation of poetic imperatives. This particular challenge and the importance of Eugene Onegin in Russian literature have resulted in an impressive number of competing translations.</p>

<ref target="/wiki/Vladimir_Nabokov" title="Vladimir Nabokov">Vladimir Nabokov</ref> severely criticised Arndt's translation, as he had criticised many previous (and later) translations. Nabokov's main criticism of Arndt's and other translations is that they sacrificed literalness and exactness for the sake of preserving the melody and rhyme.
<p>Accordingly, in 1964 he published his own translation, consisting of four volumes, which conformed scrupulously to the sense while completely eschewing melody and rhyme. The first volume contains an introduction by Nabokov and the text of the translation. The Introduction discusses the structure of the novel, the Onegin stanza in which it is written, and Pushkin's opinion of Onegin (using Pushkin's letters to his friends); it likewise gives a detailed account of both the time over which Pushkin wrote Onegin and of the various forms in which the various parts of it appeared in publication before Pushkin's death (after which there is a huge proliferation of the number of different editions). The second and third volumes consist of very detailed and rigorous notes to the text. The fourth volume contains a facsimile of the 1837 edition. The discussion of the Onegin stanza in the first volume contains the poem On Translating "Eugene Onegin", which first appeared in print in <ref target="/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</ref> on January 8, 1955, and is written in two Onegin stanzas.<ref target="#cite_note-Nabokov1955-7">[7]</ref> Nabokov reproduces the poem both so that the reader of his translation would have some experience of this unique form, and also to act as a further defence of his decision to write his translation in prose.</p>
<p>Nabokov's previously close friend <ref target="/wiki/Edmund_Wilson" title="Edmund Wilson">Edmund Wilson</ref> reviewed Nabokov's translation in the New York Review of Books, which sparked an exchange of letters and an enduring falling-out between them.<ref target="#cite_note-Wilson1965-8">[8]</ref></p>
<ref target="/wiki/John_Bayley_(writer)" title="John Bayley (writer)">John Bayley</ref> has described Nabokov's commentary as '"by far the most erudite as well as the most fascinating commentary in English on Pushkin's poem", and "as scrupulously accurate, in terms of grammar, sense and phrasing, as it is idiosyncratic and Nabokovian in its vocabulary". Some consider this "Nabokovian vocabulary" a failing, since it might require even educated speakers of English to reach for the dictionary on occasion.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>] However, it is generally agreed that Nabokov's translation is extremely accurate.

<h3>Musical[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Eugene_Onegin&action=edit&section=23" title="Edit section: Musical">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Opening in 2016 for its world premiere, the <ref target="/wiki/Arts_Club_Theatre_Company" title="Arts Club Theatre Company">Arts Club Theatre Company</ref> in Vancouver, Canada, staged a musical version called Onegin by Amiel Gladstone and <ref target="/wiki/Veda_Hille" title="Veda Hille">Veda Hille</ref>. Rather than being based solely on Pushkin's verse narrative, the musical takes equal inspiration from Tchaikovsky's opera,<ref target="#cite_note-National_Post-27">[27]</ref> subtly incorporating musical motifs from the opera and even using its structure as a template.<ref target="#cite_note-Vancouver_Sun-28">[28]</ref> In fact, it was Gladstone's time as assistant director for <ref target="/wiki/Vancouver_Opera" title="Vancouver Opera">Vancouver Opera</ref>’s last production of Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin that opened his eyes to the story’s potential for musical adaptation.<ref target="#cite_note-Vancouver_Sun-28">[28]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-29">[29]</ref></p>
<p>However, the overall musical style of Gladstone and Hille’s Onegin is distinctly non-operatic, being instead “an indie-rock musical with a modern flair”<ref target="#cite_note-30">[30]</ref> that carries over into the costumes and the interactive staging,<ref target="#cite_note-Toronto_Star-31">[31]</ref> as well as the ironic and self-referential humour and the titular character's “bored hipster persona”.<ref target="#cite_note-32">[32]</ref></p>
<p>After opening to general acclaim in 2016, Onegin took home a historic 10 <ref target="/wiki/Jessie_Richardson_Theatre_Award" title="Jessie Richardson Theatre Award">Jessie Awards</ref>, winning all but one award in its category, including the awards for outstanding production, direction (Gladstone), original composition (Gladstone and Hille), lead actor (<ref target="/wiki/Alessandro_Juliani" title="Alessandro Juliani">Alessandro Juliani</ref> as Onegin), lead actress (Meg Roe as Tatyana), and supporting actor (<ref target="/wiki/Josh_Epstein" title="Josh Epstein">Josh Epstein</ref> as Lensky).<ref target="#cite_note-33">[33]</ref></p>
<p>Since then, throughout new productions and casting changes, Onegin has garnered generally favourable reviews; for example, Louis B. Hobson of The Calgary Herald writes, “Onegin is not just good, but totally enthralling and deserves all the hype and all the awards it received in Vancouver back in 2016 when it premiered and again in 2017 during its return visit”.<ref target="#cite_note-34">[34]</ref> Nevertheless, others have criticized the show for artificiality of characterization and “inconsistent dramaturgy”,<ref target="#cite_note-Toronto_Star-31">[31]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-35">[35]</ref> claiming that Onegin fails to “come to life”.<ref target="#cite_note-National_Post-27">[27]</ref></p>
<p>Furthermore, several critics have pointed out similarities to the smash hit <ref target="/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)" title="Hamilton (musical)">Hamilton</ref> and especially to <ref target="/wiki/Natasha,_Pierre_%26_The_Great_Comet_of_1812" title="Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812">Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812</ref>, a sung-through musical likewise inspired by a classic of Russian literature (in this case, a sliver of <ref target="/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</ref>’s <ref target="/wiki/War_and_Peace" title="War and Peace">War and Peace</ref>), usually to Onegin’s disadvantage.<ref target="#cite_note-36">[36]</ref></p>

<p>In 1988, Decca/Channel 4 produced a film adaptation of Tchaikovsky's opera, directed by <ref target="/wiki/Petr_Weigl" title="Petr Weigl">Petr Weigl</ref>. <ref target="/wiki/Georg_Solti" title="Georg Solti">Sir Georg Solti</ref> acted as the conductor, while the cast featured <ref target="/wiki/Michal_Do%C4%8Dolomansk%C3%BD" title="Michal Dočolomanský">Michal Dočolomanský</ref> as Onegin and <ref target="/wiki/Magdal%C3%A9na_V%C3%A1%C5%A1%C3%A1ryov%C3%A1" title="Magdaléna Vášáryová">Magdaléna Vášáryová</ref> as Tatyana. One major difference from the novel is the duel: Onegin is presented as deliberately shooting to kill Lensky and is unrepentant at the end.</p>
<p>In 1994, the TV film Yevgeny Onyegin was produced, directed by <ref target="/wiki/Humphrey_Burton" title="Humphrey Burton">Humphrey Burton</ref> and starring <ref target="/wiki/Wojtek_Drabowicz" title="Wojtek Drabowicz">Wojtek Drabowicz</ref> as Onyegin.</p>
<p>The 1999 film, <ref target="/wiki/Onegin_(film)" title="Onegin (film)">Onegin</ref>, is an English adaptation of Pushkin's work, directed by <ref target="/wiki/Martha_Fiennes" title="Martha Fiennes">Martha Fiennes</ref>, and starring <ref target="/wiki/Ralph_Fiennes" title="Ralph Fiennes">Ralph Fiennes</ref> as Onegin, <ref target="/wiki/Liv_Tyler" title="Liv Tyler">Liv Tyler</ref> as Tatyana, and <ref target="/wiki/Toby_Stephens" title="Toby Stephens">Toby Stephens</ref> as Lensky. The film compresses the events of the novel somewhat: for example, the name day celebrations take place on the same day as Onegin's speech to Tatyana. The 1999 film, much like the 1988 film, also gives the impression that during the duel sequence Onegin deliberately shoots to kill. This screen version was also criticized for a number of mistakes and inconsistencies.</p>
