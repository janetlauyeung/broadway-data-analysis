<p>To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by <ref target="/wiki/Harper_Lee" title="Harper Lee">Harper Lee</ref> published in 1960. Instantly successful, widely read in high schools and middle schools in the United States, it has become a classic of modern <ref target="/wiki/American_literature" title="American literature">American literature</ref>, winning the <ref target="/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</ref>. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of <ref target="/wiki/Monroeville,_Alabama" title="Monroeville, Alabama">Monroeville, Alabama</ref>, in 1936, when she was 10 years old.</p>
<p>The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with the serious issues of <ref target="/wiki/Rape" title="Rape">rape</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Racial_inequality_in_the_United_States" title="Racial inequality in the United States">racial inequality</ref>. The narrator's father, <ref target="/wiki/Atticus_Finch" title="Atticus Finch">Atticus Finch</ref>, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. Historian, J. Crespino explains, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its main character, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<ref target="#cite_note-crespino-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>As a <ref target="/wiki/Southern_Gothic" title="Southern Gothic">Southern Gothic</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Bildungsroman" title="Bildungsroman">Bildungsroman</ref> novel, the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in the American <ref target="/wiki/Deep_South" title="Deep South">Deep South</ref>. The book is widely taught in schools in the United States with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice. Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Challenge_(literature)" title="Challenge (literature)">challenged</ref> for its use of racial <ref target="/wiki/Epithet" title="Epithet">epithets</ref>.</p>
<p>Reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication. Despite the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education, literary analysis of it is sparse. Author Mary McDonough Murphy, who collected individual impressions of To Kill a Mockingbird by several authors and public figures, calls the book "an astonishing phenomenon".<ref target="#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> In 2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the <ref target="/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</ref> as one "every adult should read before they die".<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> It was adapted into <ref target="/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_(film)" title="To Kill a Mockingbird (film)">an Academy Award-winning film</ref> in 1962 by director <ref target="/wiki/Robert_Mulligan" title="Robert Mulligan">Robert Mulligan</ref>, with a screenplay by <ref target="/wiki/Horton_Foote" title="Horton Foote">Horton Foote</ref>. Since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee's hometown.</p>
<p>To Kill a Mockingbird was Lee's only published book until <ref target="/wiki/Go_Set_a_Watchman" title="Go Set a Watchman">Go Set a Watchman</ref>, an earlier <ref target="/wiki/Draft_document" title="Draft document">draft</ref> of To Kill a Mockingbird, was published on July 14, 2015. Lee continued to respond to her work's impact until her death in February 2016, although she had refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964.</p>

<head>Biographical background and publication</head>
<p>Born in 1926, <ref target="/wiki/Harper_Lee" title="Harper Lee">Harper Lee</ref> grew up in the Southern town of <ref target="/wiki/Monroeville,_Alabama" title="Monroeville, Alabama">Monroeville, Alabama</ref>, where she became close friends with soon-to-be famous writer <ref target="/wiki/Truman_Capote" title="Truman Capote">Truman Capote</ref>. She attended <ref target="/wiki/Huntingdon_College" title="Huntingdon College">Huntingdon College</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama" title="Montgomery, Alabama">Montgomery</ref> (1944–45), and then studied law at the <ref target="/wiki/University_of_Alabama" title="University of Alabama">University of Alabama</ref> (1945–49). While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine Rammer Jammer at the University of Alabama. At both colleges, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time.<ref target="#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> In 1950, Lee moved to New York City, where she worked as a reservation clerk for <ref target="/wiki/British_Overseas_Airways_Corporation" title="British Overseas Airways Corporation">British Overseas Airways Corporation</ref>; there, she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in Monroeville. Hoping to be published, Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a <ref target="/wiki/Literary_agent" title="Literary agent">literary agent</ref> recommended by Capote. An editor at <ref target="/wiki/J._B._Lippincott_%26_Co." title="J. B. Lippincott & Co.">J. B. Lippincott</ref>, who bought the manuscript, advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing.</p>
<p>Donations from friends allowed her to write uninterruptedly for a year.<ref target="#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> After finishing the first draft and returning it to Lippincott, the manuscript, at that point titled "Go Set a Watchman",<ref target="#cite_note-autogenerated2-6">[6]</ref> fell into the hands of Therese von Hohoff Torrey, known professionally as <ref target="/wiki/Tay_Hohoff" title="Tay Hohoff">Tay Hohoff</ref>. Hohoff was impressed, "[T]he spark of the true writer flashed in every line," she would later recount in a corporate history of Lippincott,<ref target="#cite_note-autogenerated2-6">[6]</ref> but as Hohoff saw it, the manuscript was by no means fit for publication. It was, as she described it, "more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel." During the following two and a half years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form.<ref target="#cite_note-autogenerated2-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>After the "Watchman" title was rejected, it was re-titled Atticus but Lee renamed it To Kill a Mockingbird to reflect that the story went beyond a character portrait. The book was published on July 11, 1960.<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies.<ref target="#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said,</p>

<p>I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.' ... I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected.<ref target="#cite_note-lapl-9">[9]</ref></p>
<p>Instead of a "quick and merciful death", <ref target="/wiki/Reader%27s_Digest_Condensed_Books" title="Reader's Digest Condensed Books">Reader's Digest Condensed Books</ref> chose the book for reprinting in part, which gave it a wide readership immediately.<ref target="#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> Since the original publication, the book has never been out of print.<ref target="#cite_note-11">[11]</ref></p>

<p>The story, told by the six-year-old Jean Louise Finch, takes place during three years (1933–35) of the <ref target="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</ref> in the fictional "tired old town" of Maycomb, Alabama, the seat of Maycomb County. Jean Louise Finch, nicknamed Scout, lives with her older brother Jeremy, nicknamed Jem, and their widowed father Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer. The three children are terrified, yet fascinated by their neighbor, the <ref target="/wiki/Recluse" title="Recluse">reclusive</ref> Arthur "Boo" Radley. The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo, and few of them have seen him for many years. The children feed one another's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house. After two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone is leaving them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place. Several times the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, he never appears in person.</p>
<p>Judge Taylor appoints Atticus to defend Tom Robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, Mayella Ewell. Although many of Maycomb's citizens disapprove, Atticus agrees to defend Tom to the best of his ability. Other children taunt Jem and Scout for Atticus's actions, calling him a "<ref target="/wiki/Nigger" title="Nigger">nigger</ref>-lover". Scout is tempted to stand up for her father's honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. One night, Atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching Tom. This crisis is averted in an unexpected manner: Scout, Jem, and Dill show up, and Scout inadvertently breaks the <ref target="/wiki/Herd_mentality" title="Herd mentality">mob mentality</ref> by recognizing and talking to a classmate's father, and the would-be lynchers disperse.</p>
<p>Atticus does not want Jem and Scout to be present at Tom Robinson's trial. No seat is available on the main floor, but the Rev. Sykes invites Jem, Scout, and Dill to watch from the <ref target="/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States#Public_facilities" title="Racial segregation in the United States">colored balcony</ref>. Atticus establishes that Mayella and Bob Ewell are lying. It is revealed that Mayella made sexual advances toward Tom, subsequently resulting in her being beaten by her father. The townspeople refer to the Ewells as "<ref target="/wiki/White_trash" title="White trash">white trash</ref>" who are not to be trusted, but the jury convicts Tom regardless. Jem's faith in justice is badly shaken. Atticus is hopeful that he can get the verdict overturned, but Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison.</p>
<p>Despite Tom's conviction, Bob Ewell is humiliated by the events of the trial, Atticus explaining that he "destroyed [Ewell's] last shred of credibility at that trial."<ref target="#cite_note-12">[12]</ref> Ewell vows revenge, spitting in Atticus' face, trying to break into the judge's house, and menacing Tom Robinson's widow. Finally, he attacks Jem and Scout while they are walking home on a dark night after the school <ref target="/wiki/Halloween" title="Halloween">Halloween</ref> pageant. Jem suffers a broken arm in the struggle, but amid the confusion someone comes to the children's rescue. The mysterious man carries Jem home, where Scout realizes that he is Boo Radley.</p>
<p>Sheriff Tate arrives and discovers Ewell dead from a knife wound. Atticus believes that Jem was responsible, but Tate is certain it was Boo. The sheriff decides that, to protect Boo's privacy, he will report that Ewell simply fell on his own knife during the attack. Boo asks Scout to walk him home. After she says goodbye to him at his front door, he disappears, never to be seen again by Scout. While standing on the Radley porch, Scout imagines life from Boo's perspective.</p>

<head>Autobiographical elements</head>
<p>Lee said that To Kill a Mockingbird is not an <ref target="/wiki/Autobiography" title="Autobiography">autobiography</ref>, but rather an example of how an author "should write about what he knows and write truthfully".<ref target="#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> Nevertheless, several people and events from Lee's childhood parallel those of the fictional Scout. Lee's father, Amasa Coleman Lee, was an attorney, similar to Atticus Finch, and in 1919, he defended two black men accused of murder. After they were convicted, hanged and mutilated,<ref target="#cite_note-14">[14]</ref> he never tried another criminal case. Lee's father was also the editor and publisher of the Monroeville newspaper. Although more of a proponent of racial segregation than Atticus, he gradually became more liberal in his later years.<ref target="#cite_note-15">[15]</ref> Though Scout's mother died when she was a baby, Lee was 25 when her mother, Frances Cunningham Finch, died. Lee's mother was prone to a <ref target="/wiki/Neurosis" title="Neurosis">nervous condition</ref> that rendered her mentally and emotionally absent.<ref target="#cite_note-16">[16]</ref> Lee's older brother Edwin was the inspiration for Jem.</p>
<p>Lee modeled the character of Dill on <ref target="/wiki/Truman_Capote" title="Truman Capote">Truman Capote</ref>, her childhood friend known then as Truman Persons.<ref target="#cite_note-17">[17]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-18">[18]</ref> Just as Dill lived next door to Scout during the summer, Capote lived next door to Lee with his aunts while his mother visited New York City.<ref target="#cite_note-fleming-19">[19]</ref> Like Dill, Capote had an impressive imagination and a gift for fascinating stories. Both Lee and Capote loved to read, and were atypical children in some ways: Lee was a scrappy <ref target="/wiki/Tomboy" title="Tomboy">tomboy</ref> who was quick to fight, and Capote was ridiculed for his advanced vocabulary and lisp. She and Capote made up and acted out stories they wrote on an old <ref target="/wiki/Underwood_Typewriter_Company" title="Underwood Typewriter Company">Underwood</ref> typewriter that Lee's father gave them. They became good friends when both felt alienated from their peers; Capote called the two of them "apart people".<ref target="#cite_note-20">[20]</ref> In 1960, Capote and Lee traveled to Kansas together to investigate the multiple murders that were the basis for Capote's <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nonfiction_novel" title="Nonfiction novel">nonfiction novel</ref> <ref target="/wiki/In_Cold_Blood" title="In Cold Blood">In Cold Blood</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-21">[21]</ref></p>
<p>Down the street from the Lees lived a family whose house was always boarded up; they served as the models for the fictional Radleys. The son of the family got into some legal trouble and the father kept him at home for 24 years out of shame. He was hidden until virtually forgotten; he died in 1952.<ref target="#cite_note-22">[22]</ref></p>
<p>The origin of Tom Robinson is less clear, although many have speculated that his character was inspired by several models. When Lee was 10 years old, a white woman near Monroeville accused a black man named Walter Lett of raping her. The story and the trial were covered by her father's newspaper, which reported that Lett was convicted and sentenced to death. After a series of letters appeared claiming Lett had been falsely accused, his sentence was commuted to life in prison. He died there of <ref target="/wiki/Tuberculosis" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</ref> in 1937.<ref target="#cite_note-bigg-23">[23]</ref> Scholars believe that Robinson's difficulties reflect the notorious case of the <ref target="/wiki/Scottsboro_Boys" title="Scottsboro Boys">Scottsboro Boys</ref>,<ref target="#cite_note-24">[24]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-25">[25]</ref> in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on negligible evidence. However, in 2005, Lee stated that she had in mind something less sensational, although the Scottsboro case served "the same purpose" to display Southern <ref target="/wiki/Prejudice" title="Prejudice">prejudices</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-26">[26]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Emmett_Till" title="Emmett Till">Emmett Till</ref>, a black teenager who was murdered for allegedly flirting with a white woman in <ref target="/wiki/Mississippi" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</ref> in 1955, and whose death is credited as a catalyst for the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement" title="Civil Rights Movement">Civil Rights Movement</ref>, is also considered a model for Tom.<ref target="#cite_note-chura-27">[27]</ref></p>

<p>The narrative is very tough, because [Lee] has to both be a kid on the street and aware of the mad dogs and the spooky houses, and have this beautiful vision of how justice works and all the creaking mechanisms of the courthouse. Part of the beauty is that she... trusts the visual to lead her, and the sensory.</p>
<p>—<ref target="/wiki/Allan_Gurganus" title="Allan Gurganus">Allan Gurganus</ref><ref target="#cite_note-28">[28]</ref></p>


<p>The strongest element of style noted by critics and reviewers is Lee's talent for narration, which in an early review in <ref target="/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</ref> was called "tactile brilliance".<ref target="#cite_note-timerev-29">[29]</ref> Writing a decade later, another scholar noted, "Harper Lee has a remarkable gift of story-telling. Her art is visual, and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without jolts of transition."<ref target="#cite_note-dave-30">[30]</ref> Lee combines the narrator's voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman's reflecting on her childhood, using the ambiguity of this voice combined with the narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives.<ref target="#cite_note-dunphy-31">[31]</ref> This narrative method allows Lee to tell a "delightfully deceptive" story that mixes the simplicity of childhood observation with adult situations complicated by hidden motivations and unquestioned tradition.<ref target="#cite_note-32">[32]</ref> However, at times the blending causes reviewers to question Scout's preternatural vocabulary and depth of understanding.<ref target="#cite_note-adams-33">[33]</ref> Both Harding LeMay and the novelist and literary critic <ref target="/wiki/Granville_Hicks" title="Granville Hicks">Granville Hicks</ref> expressed doubt that children as sheltered as Scout and Jem could understand the complexities and horrors involved in the trial for Tom Robinson's life.<ref target="#cite_note-LeMay-34">[34]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-Hicks-35">[35]</ref></p>
<p>Writing about Lee's style and use of humor in a tragic story, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin states: "Laughter ... [exposes] the gangrene under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it; one can hardly ... be controlled by what one is able to laugh at."<ref target="#cite_note-humor-36">[36]</ref> Scout's precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspired National Endowment of the Arts director David Kipen to call her "hysterically funny".<ref target="#cite_note-37">[37]</ref> To address complex issues, however, Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee uses <ref target="/wiki/Parody" title="Parody">parody</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Satire" title="Satire">satire</ref>, and <ref target="/wiki/Irony" title="Irony">irony</ref> effectively by using a child's perspective. After Dill promises to marry her, then spends too much time with Jem, Scout reasons the best way to get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up, which she does several times.<ref target="#cite_note-38">[38]</ref> Scout's first day in school is a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further.<ref target="#cite_note-39">[39]</ref> Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society. Satire and irony are used to such an extent that Tavernier-Courbin suggests one interpretation for the book's title: Lee is doing the mocking—of education, the justice system, and her own society—by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval.<ref target="#cite_note-humor-36">[36]</ref></p>
<p>Critics also note the entertaining methods used to drive the plot.<ref target="#cite_note-40">[40]</ref> When Atticus is out of town, Jem locks a <ref target="/wiki/Sunday_school" title="Sunday school">Sunday school</ref> classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of <ref target="/wiki/Shadrach,_Meshach,_and_Abednego" title="Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego">Shadrach</ref>. This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson's.<ref target="#cite_note-41">[41]</ref> Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing the audience to laugh uproariously. She is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.<ref target="#cite_note-42">[42]</ref></p>

<head>Genres</head>
<p>Scholars have characterized To Kill a Mockingbird as both a <ref target="/wiki/Southern_Gothic" title="Southern Gothic">Southern Gothic</ref> and a <ref target="/wiki/Bildungsroman" title="Bildungsroman">Bildungsroman</ref>. The grotesque and near-supernatural qualities of Boo Radley and his house, and the element of racial injustice involving Tom Robinson, contribute to the aura of the <ref target="/wiki/Gothic_fiction" title="Gothic fiction">Gothic</ref> in the novel.<ref target="#cite_note-43">[43]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-blackall-44">[44]</ref> Lee used the term "Gothic" to describe the <ref target="/wiki/Gothic_architecture" title="Gothic architecture">architecture</ref> of Maycomb's courthouse and in regard to Dill's exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley.<ref target="#cite_note-45">[45]</ref> Outsiders are also an important element of Southern Gothic texts and Scout and Jem's questions about the hierarchy in the town cause scholars to compare the novel to <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catcher_in_the_Rye" title="Catcher in the Rye">Catcher in the Rye</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn" title="Adventures of Huckleberry Finn">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-46">[46]</ref> Despite challenging the town's systems, Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above all others, because he believes that following one's conscience is the highest priority, even when the result is social <ref target="/wiki/Ostracism" title="Ostracism">ostracism</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-fine-47">[47]</ref> However, scholars debate about the Southern Gothic classification, noting that Boo Radley is in fact human, protective, and benevolent. Furthermore, in addressing themes such as alcoholism, <ref target="/wiki/Incest" title="Incest">incest</ref>, rape, and racial violence, Lee wrote about her small town <ref target="/wiki/Literary_realism" title="Literary realism">realistically</ref> rather than melodramatically. She portrays the problems of individual characters as universal underlying issues in every society.<ref target="#cite_note-blackall-44">[44]</ref></p>
<p>As children coming of age, Scout and Jem face hard realities and learn from them. Lee seems to examine Jem's sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie the day after the trial, "It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon ... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that's what they seemed like".<ref target="#cite_note-48">[48]</ref> This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, "To Kill a Mockingbird can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be."<ref target="#cite_note-ware-49">[49]</ref></p>

<head>Themes</head>
<p>Despite the novel's immense popularity upon publication, it has not received the close critical attention paid to other modern American classics. Don Noble, editor of a book of essays about the novel, estimates that the ratio of sales to analytical essays may be a million to one. Christopher Metress writes that the book is "an icon whose emotive sway remains strangely powerful because it also remains unexamined".<ref target="#cite_note-riseatticus-50">[50]</ref> Noble suggests it does not receive academic attention because of its consistent status as a best-seller ("If that many people like it, it can't be any good.") and that general readers seem to feel they do not require analytical interpretation.<ref target="#cite_note-51">[51]</ref></p>

<p>Harper Lee had remained famously detached from interpreting the novel since the mid-1960s. However, she gave some insight into her themes when, in a rare letter to the editor, she wrote in response to the passionate reaction her book caused:Surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that To Kill a Mockingbird spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct, Christian in its ethic, that is the heritage of all Southerners."<ref target="#cite_note-twits-52">[52]</ref></p>
<head>Southern life and racial injustice</head>

<p>In the 33 years since its publication, [To Kill a Mockingbird] has never been the focus of a dissertation, and it has been the subject of only six literary studies, several of them no more than a couple of pages long.</p>
<p>—Claudia Johnson in To Kill a Mockingbird: Threatening Boundaries, 1994<ref target="#cite_note-53">[53]</ref></p>

<p>When the book was released, reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts, and opinion was mixed about Lee's ability to connect them.<ref target="#cite_note-54">[54]</ref> The first part of the novel concerns the children's fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood. Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem's observations of their quirky neighbors. One writer was so impressed by Lee's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romantic <ref target="/wiki/American_literary_regionalism" title="American literary regionalism">regionalism</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-erisman-55">[55]</ref> This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee's representation of the Southern <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caste_system" title="Caste system">caste system</ref> to explain almost every character's behavior in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb's inhabitants' faults and advantages to <ref target="/wiki/Genealogy" title="Genealogy">genealogy</ref> (families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks),<ref target="#cite_note-bruell-56">[56]</ref> and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb. This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Scout's definition of "fine folks" being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have. <ref target="/wiki/Southern_United_States" title="Southern United States">The South</ref> itself, with its traditions and taboos, seems to drive the plot more than the characters.<ref target="#cite_note-erisman-55">[55]</ref></p>
<p>The second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed "the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro".<ref target="#cite_note-LeMay-34">[34]</ref> In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with <ref target="/wiki/Race_relations" title="Race relations">race relations</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-57">[57]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Claudia_Durst_Johnson" title="Claudia Durst Johnson">Claudia Durst Johnson</ref> considers it "reasonable to believe" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: <ref target="/wiki/Rosa_Parks" title="Rosa Parks">Rosa Parks</ref>' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Montgomery_Bus_Boycott" title="Montgomery Bus Boycott">Montgomery Bus Boycott</ref>, and the 1956 riots at the <ref target="/wiki/University_of_Alabama" title="University of Alabama">University of Alabama</ref> after <ref target="/wiki/Autherine_Lucy" title="Autherine Lucy">Autherine Lucy</ref> and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980).<ref target="#cite_note-secret-58">[58]</ref> In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: "To Kill a Mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition."<ref target="#cite_note-hovet-59">[59]</ref></p>
<p>Scholar Patrick Chura, who suggests <ref target="/wiki/Emmett_Till" title="Emmett Till">Emmett Till</ref> was a model for Tom Robinson, enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional Tom that Till also faced. Chura notes the icon of the black rapist causing harm to the representation of the "mythologized vulnerable and sacred Southern womanhood".<ref target="#cite_note-chura-27">[27]</ref> Any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused. Tom Robinson's trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence, as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury's decision. Furthermore, the victim of racial injustice in To Kill a Mockingbird was physically impaired, which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of, but also crippled him in other ways.<ref target="#cite_note-chura-27">[27]</ref> Roslyn Siegel includes Tom Robinson as an example of the recurring motif among white Southern writers of the black man as "stupid, pathetic, defenseless, and dependent upon the fair dealing of the whites, rather than his own intelligence to save him".<ref target="#cite_note-60">[60]</ref> Although Tom is spared from being lynched, he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison, being shot seventeen times.</p>
<p>The theme of racial injustice appears <ref target="/wiki/Symbol" title="Symbol">symbolically</ref> in the novel as well. For example, Atticus must shoot a <ref target="/wiki/Rabies" title="Rabies">rabid</ref> dog, even though it is not his job to do so.<ref target="#cite_note-61">[61]</ref> Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog,<ref target="#cite_note-jones-62">[62]</ref> must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Imagery_(literature)" title="Imagery (literature)">imagery</ref> from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, "[t]he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson .... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury's and the town's anger."<ref target="#cite_note-jones-62">[62]</ref></p>

<head>Class</head>

<p>One of the amazing things about the writing in To Kill a Mockingbird is the economy with which Harper Lee delineates not only race—white and black within a small community—but class. I mean different kinds of black people and white people both, from poor white trash to the upper crust—the whole social fabric.</p>
<p>—<ref target="/wiki/Lee_Smith_(fiction_author)" title="Lee Smith (fiction author)">Lee Smith</ref><ref target="#cite_note-63">[63]</ref></p>


<p>In a 1964 interview, Lee remarked that her aspiration was "to be ... the <ref target="/wiki/Jane_Austen" title="Jane Austen">Jane Austen</ref> of South Alabama."<ref target="#cite_note-blackall-44">[44]</ref> Both Austen and Lee challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing. When Scout embarrasses her poorer classmate, Walter Cunningham, at the Finch home one day, Calpurnia, their black cook, chastises and punishes her for doing so.<ref target="#cite_note-64">[64]</ref> Atticus respects Calpurnia's judgment, and later in the book even stands up to his sister, the formidable Aunt Alexandra, when she strongly suggests they fire Calpurnia.<ref target="#cite_note-65">[65]</ref> One writer notes that Scout, "in Austenian fashion", satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify.<ref target="#cite_note-shackelford-66">[66]</ref> Literary critic Jean Blackall lists the priorities shared by the two authors: "affirmation of order in society, obedience, courtesy, and respect for the individual without regard for status".<ref target="#cite_note-blackall-44">[44]</ref></p>
<p>Scholars argue that Lee's approach to class and race was more complex "than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to 'poor white trash' ... Lee demonstrates how issues of gender and class intensify prejudice, silence the voices that might challenge the existing order, and greatly complicate many Americans' conception of the causes of racism and segregation."<ref target="#cite_note-hovet-59">[59]</ref> Lee's use of the middle-class narrative voice is a literary device that allows an intimacy with the reader, regardless of class or cultural background, and fosters a sense of <ref target="/wiki/Nostalgia" title="Nostalgia">nostalgia</ref>. Sharing Scout and Jem's perspective, the reader is allowed to engage in relationships with the conservative <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Antebellum_era" title="Antebellum era">antebellum</ref> Mrs. Dubose; the lower-class Ewells, and the Cunninghams who are equally poor but behave in vastly different ways; the wealthy but ostracized Mr. Dolphus Raymond; and Calpurnia and other members of the black community. The children internalize Atticus' admonition not to judge someone until they have walked around in that person's skin, gaining a greater understanding of people's motives and behavior.<ref target="#cite_note-hovet-59">[59]</ref></p>

<head>Courage and compassion</head>
<p>The novel has been noted for its poignant exploration of different forms of <ref target="/wiki/Courage" title="Courage">courage</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-67">[67]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-jolley-68">[68]</ref> Scout's impulsive inclination to fight students who insult Atticus reflects her attempt to stand up for him and defend him. Atticus is the moral center of the novel, however, and he teaches Jem one of the most significant lessons of courage.<ref target="#cite_note-69">[69]</ref> In a statement that both <ref target="/wiki/Foreshadowing" title="Foreshadowing">foreshadows</ref> Atticus' motivation for defending Tom Robinson and describes Mrs. Dubose, who is determined to break herself of a <ref target="/wiki/Morphine" title="Morphine">morphine</ref> addiction, Atticus tells Jem that courage is "when you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what".<ref target="#cite_note-70">[70]</ref></p>

<ref target="/wiki/Charles_J._Shields" title="Charles J. Shields">Charles J. Shields</ref>, who wrote the first book-length biography of Harper Lee, offers the reason for the novel's enduring popularity and impact is that "its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal".<ref target="#cite_note-71">[71]</ref> Atticus' lesson to Scout that "you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view—until you climb around in his skin and walk around in it" exemplifies his compassion.<ref target="#cite_note-jolley-68">[68]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-72">[72]</ref> She ponders the comment when listening to Mayella Ewell's testimony. When Mayella reacts with confusion to Atticus' question if she has any friends, Scout offers that she must be lonelier than Boo Radley. Having walked Boo home after he saves their lives, Scout stands on the Radley porch and considers the events of the previous three years from Boo's perspective. One writer remarks, "... [w]hile the novel concerns tragedy and injustice, heartache and loss, it also carries with it a strong sense [of] courage, compassion, and an awareness of history to be better human beings."<ref target="#cite_note-jolley-68">[68]</ref>

<head>Gender roles</head>
<p>Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider.<ref target="#cite_note-ware-49">[49]</ref> Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong-willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view.<ref target="#cite_note-shackelford-66">[66]</ref> For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and <ref target="/wiki/Camisole" title="Camisole">camisole</ref>, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, "Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child."<ref target="#cite_note-shackelford-66">[66]</ref></p>
<p>Absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel. Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could remember her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo's confinement to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers.<ref target="#cite_note-finegender-73">[73]</ref> Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter,<ref target="#cite_note-baecker-74">[74]</ref> and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house to the extent that Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men, as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society, can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: "It is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight."<ref target="#cite_note-finegender-73">[73]</ref></p>

<head>Laws, written and unwritten</head>
<ref target="/wiki/Allusion" title="Allusion">Allusions</ref> to legal issues in To Kill a Mockingbird, particularly in scenes outside of the courtroom, have drawn the attention of legal scholars. Claudia Durst Johnson writes that "a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals".<ref target="#cite_note-75">[75]</ref> The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Charles_Lamb_(writer)" title="Charles Lamb (writer)">Charles Lamb</ref> reads: "Lawyers, I suppose, were children once." Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one's palm, and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season? Many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms: Mr. Dolphus Raymond has been exiled by society for taking a black woman as his common-law wife and having interracial children; Mayella Ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing Tom Robinson; by being turned into a non-person, Boo Radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him.<ref target="#cite_note-secret-58">[58]</ref> Scout repeatedly breaks codes and laws and reacts to her punishment for them. For example, she refuses to wear frilly clothes, saying that Aunt Alexandra's "fanatical" attempts to place her in them made her feel "a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on [her]".<ref target="#cite_note-76">[76]</ref> Johnson states, "[t]he novel is a study of how Jem and Scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of (their) small worlds."<ref target="#cite_note-secret-58">[58]</ref>

<head>Loss of innocence</head>
<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Mimus_polyglottus1_cropped.png"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Mimus_polyglottus1_cropped.png" title="Enlarge"></ref>Lee used the mockingbird to symbolize innocence in the novel
<p>Songbirds and their associated symbolism appear throughout the novel. Their <ref target="/wiki/Surname" title="Surname">family name</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Finch" title="Finch">Finch</ref> is also Lee's mother's <ref target="/wiki/Surname" title="Surname">maiden name</ref>. The titular <ref target="/wiki/Northern_mockingbird" title="Northern mockingbird">mockingbird</ref> is a key motif of this theme, which first appears when Atticus, having given his children air-rifles for Christmas, allows their Uncle Jack to teach them to shoot. Atticus warns them that, although they can "shoot all the bluejays they want", they must remember that "it's a sin to kill a mockingbird".<ref target="#cite_note-lee103-77">[77]</ref> Confused, Scout approaches her neighbor Miss Maudie, who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures. She points out that mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs, saying, "They don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us."<ref target="#cite_note-lee103-77">[77]</ref> Writer Edwin Bruell summarized the symbolism when he wrote in 1964, "'To kill a mockingbird' is to kill that which is innocent and harmless—like Tom Robinson."<ref target="#cite_note-bruell-56">[56]</ref> Scholars have noted that Lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when trying to make a moral point.<ref target="#cite_note-dave-30">[30]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-schuster-78">[78]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-79">[79]</ref></p>
<p>Tom Robinson is the chief example, among several in the novel, of innocents being carelessly or deliberately destroyed. However, scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley: "Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun (as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history), Scout comes to see him as a 'mockingbird'—that is, as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished."<ref target="#cite_note-80">[80]</ref> The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her, and, in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson,<ref target="#cite_note-chura-27">[27]</ref> states about a character who was misunderstood, "when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done any of those things ... Atticus, he was real nice," to which he responds, "Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them."<ref target="#cite_note-81">[81]</ref></p>
<p>The novel exposes the loss of innocence so frequently that reviewer R. A. Dave claims that because every character has to face, or even suffer defeat, the book takes on elements of a classical <ref target="/wiki/Tragedy" title="Tragedy">tragedy</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-dave-30">[30]</ref> In exploring how each character deals with his or her own personal defeat, Lee builds a framework to judge whether the characters are heroes or fools. She guides the reader in such judgments, alternating between unabashed adoration and biting <ref target="/wiki/Irony" title="Irony">irony</ref>. Scout's experience with the Missionary Society is an ironic juxtaposition of women who mock her, gossip, and "reflect a smug, colonialist attitude toward other races" while giving the "appearance of gentility, piety, and morality".<ref target="#cite_note-shackelford-66">[66]</ref> Conversely, when Atticus loses Tom's case, he is last to leave the courtroom, except for his children and the black spectators in the colored balcony, who rise silently as he walks underneath them, to honor his efforts.<ref target="#cite_note-82">[82]</ref></p>

<head>Reception</head>
<p>Despite her editors' warnings that the book might not sell well, it quickly became a sensation, bringing acclaim to Lee in literary circles, in her hometown of Monroeville, and throughout Alabama.<ref target="#cite_note-83">[83]</ref> The book went through numerous subsequent printings and became widely available through its inclusion in the <ref target="/wiki/Book_of_the_Month_Club" title="Book of the Month Club">Book of the Month Club</ref> and editions released by <ref target="/wiki/Reader%27s_Digest_Condensed_Books" title="Reader's Digest Condensed Books">Reader's Digest Condensed Books</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-bain-84">[84]</ref></p>
<p>Initial reactions to the novel were varied. <ref target="/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</ref> declared Lee "a skilled, unpretentious, and totally ingenuous writer",<ref target="#cite_note-85">[85]</ref> and <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Atlantic_Monthly" title="The Atlantic Monthly">The Atlantic Monthly</ref>'s reviewer rated the book "pleasant, undemanding reading", but found the narrative voice—"a six-year-old girl with the prose style of a well-educated adult"—to be implausible.<ref target="#cite_note-adams-33">[33]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</ref> magazine's 1960 review of the book states that it "teaches the reader an astonishing number of useful truths about little girls and about Southern life" and calls Scout Finch "the most appealing child since <ref target="/wiki/Carson_McCullers" title="Carson McCullers">Carson McCullers</ref>' Frankie got left behind at the <ref target="/wiki/The_Member_of_the_Wedding" title="The Member of the Wedding">wedding</ref>".<ref target="#cite_note-timerev-29">[29]</ref> The Chicago Sunday Tribune noted the even-handed approach to the narration of the novel's events, writing: "This is in no way a sociological novel. It underlines no cause ... To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel of strong contemporary national significance."<ref target="#cite_note-86">[86]</ref></p>
<p>Not all reviewers were enthusiastic. Some lamented the use of poor white Southerners, and one-dimensional black victims,<ref target="#cite_note-87">[87]</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Granville_Hicks" title="Granville Hicks">Granville Hicks</ref> labeled the book "<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Melodramatic" title="Melodramatic">melodramatic</ref> and contrived".<ref target="#cite_note-Hicks-35">[35]</ref> When the book was first released, Southern writer <ref target="/wiki/Flannery_O%27Connor" title="Flannery O'Connor">Flannery O'Connor</ref> commented, "I think for a child's book it does all right. It's interesting that all the folks that are buying it don't know they're reading a child's book. Somebody ought to say what it is."<ref target="#cite_note-riseatticus-50">[50]</ref> Carson McCullers apparently agreed with the Time magazine review, writing to a cousin: "Well, honey, one thing we know is that she's been poaching on my literary preserves."<ref target="#cite_note-88">[88]</ref></p>
<p>One year after its publication To Kill a Mockingbird had been translated into ten languages.

<p>One of the most significant impacts To Kill a Mockingbird has had is Atticus Finch's model of integrity for the legal profession.

<p>In 1992, an Alabama editorial called for the death of Atticus, saying that as liberal as Atticus was, he still worked within a system of institutionalized <ref target="/wiki/Racism" title="Racism">racism</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Sexism" title="Sexism">sexism</ref> and should not be revered.

<p>To Kill a Mockingbird has been a source of significant controversy since its being the subject of classroom study as early as 1963.

<p>With a shift of attitudes about race in the 1970s, To Kill a Mockingbird faced challenges of a different sort: the treatment of racism in Maycomb was not condemned harshly enough. This has led to disparate perceptions that the novel has a generally positive impact on race relations for white readers, but a more ambiguous reception by black readers. In one high-profile case outside the U.S., school districts in the Canadian provinces of <ref target="/wiki/New_Brunswick" title="New Brunswick">New Brunswick</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Nova_Scotia" title="Nova Scotia">Nova Scotia</ref> attempted to have the book removed from standard teaching curricula in the 1990s,<ref target="#cite_note-124">[note 3]</ref> stating:</p>

She also steadfastly refused to provide an introduction, writing in 1995: "Introductions inhibit pleasure, they kill the joy of anticipation, they frustrate curiosity.

<p>In May 2005, Lee made an uncharacteristic appearance at the <ref target="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Public_Library" title="Los Angeles Public Library">Los Angeles Public Library</ref> at the request of Peck's widow Veronique, who said of Lee:</p>

<p>She's like a national treasure. She's someone who has made a difference ... with this book. The book is still as strong as it ever was, and so is the film. All the kids in the United States read this book and see the film in the seventh and eighth grades and write papers and essays. My husband used to get thousands and thousands of letters from teachers who would send them to him.<ref target="#cite_note-lapl-9">[9]</ref></p>

<p>The book has also been adapted as a play by Christopher Sergel. It debuted in 1990 in Monroeville, a town that labels itself "The Literary Capital of Alabama". The play runs every May on the county courthouse grounds and townspeople make up the cast. White male audience members are chosen at the intermission to make up the jury. During the courtroom scene the production moves into the Monroe County Courthouse and the audience is racially segregated.<ref target="#cite_note-165">[160]</ref> Author <ref target="/wiki/Albert_Murray_(writer)" title="Albert Murray (writer)">Albert Murray</ref> said of the relationship of the town to the novel (and the annual performance): "It becomes part of the town ritual, like the religious underpinning of <ref target="/wiki/Mardi_Gras" title="Mardi Gras">Mardi Gras</ref>. With the whole town crowded around the actual courthouse, it's part of a central, civic education—what Monroeville aspires to be."<ref target="#cite_note-166">[161]</ref></p>

The production returned to the venue to close the 2014 season, prior to a UK tour.<ref target="#cite_note-169">[164]</ref></p>
<p>According to a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/National_Geographic_(magazine)" title="National Geographic (magazine)">National Geographic</ref> article, the novel is so revered in Monroeville that people quote lines from it like Scripture; yet Harper Lee herself refused to attend any performances, because "she abhors anything that trades on the book's fame".<ref target="#cite_note-170">[165]</ref> To underscore this sentiment, Lee demanded that a book of recipes named Calpurnia's Cookbook not be published and sold out of the Monroe County Heritage Museum.<ref target="#cite_note-171">[166]</ref> David Lister in The Independent states that Lee's refusal to speak to reporters made them desire to interview her all the more, and her silence "makes <ref target="/wiki/Bob_Dylan" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</ref> look like a media tart".<ref target="#cite_note-172">[167]</ref> Despite her discouragement, a rising number of tourists made Monroeville their destination, hoping to see Lee's inspiration for the book, or Lee herself. Local residents call them "Mockingbird groupies", and although Lee was not reclusive, she refused publicity and interviews with an emphatic "Hell, no!"<ref target="#cite_note-173">[168]</ref></p>
