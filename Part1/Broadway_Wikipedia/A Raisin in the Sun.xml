<h2>Plot[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=A_Raisin_in_the_Sun&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Plot">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Walter and Ruth Younger, their son Travis, along with Walter's mother Lena (Mama) and Walter's sister Beneatha, live in poverty in a dilapidated two-bedroom apartment on Chicago's south side. Walter is barely making a living as a limousine driver. Though Ruth is content with their lot, Walter is not and desperately wishes to become wealthy. His plan is to invest in a liquor store in partnership with Willy and Bobo, street-smart acquaintances of Walter's.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the play, Walter and Beneatha's father has recently died, and Mama (Lena) is waiting for a life insurance check for $10,000. Walter has a sense of entitlement to the money, but Mama has religious objections to alcohol and Beneatha has to remind him it is Mama's call how to spend it. Eventually, Mama puts some of the money down on a new house, choosing an all-white neighborhood over a black one for the practical reason that it happens to be much cheaper. Later she relents and gives the rest of the money to Walter to invest with the provision that he reserve $3,000 for Beneatha's education. Walter passes the money on to Willy's naive sidekick Bobo, who gives it to Willy, who absconds with it, depriving Walter and Beneatha of their dreams, though not the Youngers of their new home. Meanwhile, Karl Lindner, a white representative of the neighborhood they plan to move to, makes a generous offer to buy them out. He wishes to avoid neighborhood tensions over the interracial population, which to the three women's horror Walter prepares to accept as a solution to their financial setback. Lena says that while money was something they try to work for, they should never take it if it was a person's way of telling them they weren't fit to walk the same earth as they.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Beneatha's character and direction in life are being defined for us by two different men: Beneatha's wealthy and educated boyfriend George Murchison, and Joseph Asagai. Neither man is actively involved in the Youngers' financial ups and downs. George represents the "fully assimilated black man" who denies his African heritage with a "smarter than thou" attitude, which Beneatha finds disgusting, while dismissively mocking Walter's lack of money and education. Joseph patiently teaches Beneatha about her African heritage; he gives her thoughtfully useful gifts from Africa while pointing out she is unwittingly assimilating herself into white ways. She straightens her hair, for example, which he characterizes as "mutilation."</p>
<p>When Beneatha becomes distraught at the loss of the money, she is upbraided by Joseph for her materialism. She eventually accepts his point of view that things will get better with a lot of effort, along with his proposal of marriage and his invitation to move with him to Nigeria to practice medicine.</p>
<p>Walter is oblivious to the stark contrast between George and Joseph: his pursuit of wealth can be attained only by liberating himself from Joseph's culture, to which he attributes his poverty, and by rising to George's level, wherein he sees his salvation. Walter redeems himself and black pride at the end by changing his mind and not accepting the buyout offer, stating that the family is proud of who they are and will try to be good neighbors. The play closes with the family leaving for their new home but uncertain future.</p>
<p>The character Mrs. Johnson and a few scenes were cut from the Broadway performance and in reproductions due to time constraints. Mrs. Johnson is the Younger family's nosy and loud neighbor. She cannot understand how the family can consider moving to a white neighborhood and jokes that she will probably read in the newspaper in a month that they have been killed in a bombing. Her lines are employed as comic relief, but Hansberry also uses this scene to mock those who are too scared to stand up for their rights. In the introduction by <ref target="/wiki/Robert_B._Nemiroff" title="Robert B. Nemiroff">Robert B. Nemiroff</ref>, he writes that the scene is included in print because it draws attention away from a seemingly happy ending to a more violent reality inspired by Hansberry's own experiences.</p>

<p>What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?</p>

<p>Experiences in this play echo a lawsuit (<ref target="/wiki/Hansberry_v._Lee" title="Hansberry v. Lee">Hansberry v. Lee</ref>, 311 U.S. 32 (1940)), to which the playwright Lorraine Hansberry's family was a party when they fought to have their day in court because a previous class action about racially motivated restrictive covenants (Burke v. Kleiman, 277 Ill. App. 519 (1934)) had been similar to their situation. This case was heard prior to the passage of the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fair_Housing_Act" title="Fair Housing Act">Fair Housing Act</ref> (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968), which prohibited discrimination in housing and created the <ref target="/wiki/Office_of_Fair_Housing_and_Equal_Opportunity" title="Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity">Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity</ref>. The Hansberry won their right to be heard as a matter of due process of law in relation to the <ref target="/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</ref>. The <ref target="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</ref> held that the Hansberry defendants were not bound by the Burke decision because the class of defendants in the respective cases had conflicting goals, and thus could not be considered to be the same class.</p>
<p>The plaintiff in the first action in 1934 was Olive Ida Burke, who brought the suit on behalf of a property owners' association to enforce racial restrictions. Her husband, James Burke, later sold a house to Carl Hansberry (Lorraine's father) when he changed his mind about the validity of the covenant. Mr. Burke's decision may have been motivated by the changing demographics of the neighborhood, but it was also influenced by <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Depression" title="The Depression">the Depression</ref>. The demand for houses was so low among white buyers that Mr. Hansberry may have been the only prospective purchaser available.<ref target="#cite_note-4">[4]</ref></p>

<p>Lorraine reflects upon the litigation in her book To Be Young, Gifted, and Black: </p>
<p>"Twenty-five years ago, [my father] spent a small personal fortune, his considerable talents, and many years of his life fighting, in association with NAACP attorneys, Chicago’s ‘restrictive covenants’ in one of this nation's ugliest ghettos. That fight also required our family to occupy disputed property in a hellishly hostile ‘white neighborhood’ in which literally howling mobs surrounded our house. ... My memories of this ‘correct’ way of fighting white supremacy in America include being spat at, cursed and pummeled in the daily trek to and from school. And I also remember my desperate and courageous mother, patrolling our household all night with a loaded German <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Luger_(pistol)" title="Luger (pistol)">Luger</ref> (pistol), doggedly guarding her four children, while my father fought the respectable part of the battle in the Washington court."</p>

<p>With a cast in which all but one character is black, A Raisin in the Sun was considered a risky investment, and it took over a year for producer <ref target="/wiki/Philip_Rose_(theatrical_producer)" title="Philip Rose (theatrical producer)">Philip Rose</ref> to raise enough money to launch it. There was disagreement with how it should be played, with focus on the mother or focus on the son. When the play hit New York, Poitier played it with the focus on the son and found not only his calling but also an audience enthralled.<ref target="#cite_note-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>After touring to positive reviews, the play premiered on <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref> at the <ref target="/wiki/Ethel_Barrymore_Theatre" title="Ethel Barrymore Theatre">Ethel Barrymore Theatre</ref> on March 11, 1959.

<p>Waiting for the curtain to rise on opening night, Hansberry and producer Rose did not expect the play to be a success, for it had already received mixed reviews from a preview audience the night before. Though it won popular and critical acclaim, reviewers argued about whether the play was "universal" or particular to black experience.<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> It was then produced on tour.</p>
<p>A Raisin in the Sun was the first play written by a black woman to be produced on Broadway, as well as the first with a black director, Mr. Richards.<ref target="#cite_note-Corley-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>Hansberry noted that her play introduced details of black life to the overwhelmingly white Broadway audiences, while director Richards observed that it was the first play to which large numbers of black people were drawn.<ref target="#cite_note-Corley-8">[8]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Frank_Rich" title="Frank Rich">Frank Rich</ref>, writing in <ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref> in 1983, stated that A Raisin in the Sun "changed American theater forever."<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> In 2016, Claire Brennan wrote in The Guardian that "The power and craft of the writing make A Raisin in the Sun as moving today as it was then."<ref target="#cite_note-10">[10]</ref></p>
