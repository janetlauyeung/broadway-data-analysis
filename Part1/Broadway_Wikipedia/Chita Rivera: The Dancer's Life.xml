<h2>History[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Chita_Rivera:_The_Dancer%27s_Life&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: History">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Chita Rivera: The Dancer's Life, was first conceived by <ref target="/wiki/Chita_Rivera" title="Chita Rivera">Chita Rivera</ref> in 2003, while she was appearing in the musical <ref target="/wiki/Nine_(musical)" title="Nine (musical)">Nine</ref> on <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref>. As Rivera's next project, the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Joseph_Papp_Public_Theater" title="Joseph Papp Public Theater">Public Theater</ref> production of <ref target="/wiki/The_Visit_(musical)" title="The Visit (musical)">The Visit</ref> had been indefinitely canceled, Rivera approached that show's book writer, <ref target="/wiki/Terrence_McNally" title="Terrence McNally">Terrence McNally</ref> with the idea of a musical based on her life. Rivera's conception which was that the musical would open with her dancing to her father's music, and progress through the varied stages of her career. McNally and Rivera officially announced in November 2003 that they were working on the show, and that a workshop production would be held in summer of 2004 at the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center in Florida. Marty Bell and <ref target="/wiki/Graciela_Daniele" title="Graciela Daniele">Graciela Daniele</ref> were lined up as producer and director, respectively, of the workshop.<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>In 2005, Rivera debuted in And Now I Sing, a one-woman cabaret act at Feinstein's at the Regency in New York City that ran from February 22 through March 12.<ref target="#cite_note-2">[2]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-holden-3">[3]</ref> Though the one-woman show and its venue were intimate, the reviews were strong. Stephen Holden, in his review for <ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref>, wrote that "her program finds a comfortable mix of sass and sentiment" and noted that in several songs ("Where Am I Going?" from Sweet Charity for example), she "captures exactly the right tone of dazed determination."<ref target="#cite_note-holden-3">[3]</ref> The act also marked the debut of some of the anecdotes and stage patter that would be more fully fleshed out by McNally for the Broadway revue. Later that year, The Denver Center for the Performing Arts announced that a one-woman show, "Chita Rivera Dances Through Life" would debut at that theater. Featuring a book by McNally and direction and choreography by Daniele. However, funding didn't materialize, and the booking was canceled.</p>
<p>It was announced in August 2005 that the revue would have a pre-Broadway production at the <ref target="/wiki/Old_Globe_Theatre" title="Old Globe Theatre">Old Globe Theatre</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/San_Diego" title="San Diego">San Diego</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> The revue, now retiled Chita Rivera: The Dancer's Life opened at the <ref target="/wiki/Old_Globe_Theatre" title="Old Globe Theatre">Old Globe Theatre</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/San_Diego" title="San Diego">San Diego</ref> on September 10, 2005 and played until October 23.<ref target="#cite_note-globe-5">[5]</ref> An engagement on Broadway at the <ref target="/wiki/Gerald_Schoenfeld_Theatre" title="Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre">Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre</ref> was confirmed for November 2005 in previews.<ref target="#cite_note-globe-5">[5]</ref> Matthew White and Frank Webb were subsequently asked to design Rivera's dressing room.<ref target="#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> The Broadway production of Chita Rivera: The Dancer's Life began its limited run with a series of previews in November, and officially opened on December 11, 2005 to mixed reviews. The song selection and other aspects of the production were tweaked throughout the run: For example, an opening prologue featuring the dancers warming up before the show was dropped shortly after the show opened, and the number "America" was only added to the show in January 2006. More revisions were required during Rivera's special "birthday week" performances on January 24–26, during which her former co-star <ref target="/wiki/Dick_Van_Dyke" title="Dick Van Dyke">Dick Van Dyke</ref> joined her on stage.<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> The show closed on February 19, 2006 after 72 performances. Rivera immediately embarked on a national tour, during which many numbers were dropped, and the character of "Young Chita" was eliminated.</p>

<h2>Synopsis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Chita_Rivera:_The_Dancer%27s_Life&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Synopsis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The show is divided into thematic sections during which <ref target="/wiki/Chita_Rivera" title="Chita Rivera">Chita Rivera</ref> shares anecdotes from her life. Members of the ensemble play the part of various figures in her life.</p>

<p>Act I</p>
<p>Chita remembers her father, a professional saxophonist who died when she was seven years old, playing "Perfidia" for her. "Little Chita" (played by a child actress) picks up the rhythm in this music in a dance which moves from the scene to the front of a large screen. Suddenly, the shadow of Chita Rivera herself appears behind her. The screen rises, revealing Rivera, who continues the dance. (This sequence was altered for the touring version, which eliminated the "Young Chita" role.)</p>
<p>After this introduction, Rivera is at the <ref target="/wiki/White_House" title="White House">White House</ref> for the 2002 <ref target="/wiki/Kennedy_Center_Honors" title="Kennedy Center Honors">Kennedy Center Honors</ref>, where she is to be the first Latina-American to receive the Honor. She begins to reminisce ("The Secret O' Life") and decides that "the secret of life is enjoying the passage of time."</p>
<p>The next scene shows life at the Del Rivero family table in <ref target="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</ref>, when Chita was a young child. Various family members react to Chita's "Dancing on the Kitchen Table," and, when the table breaks, her parents decide to send Chita to dance class. This sequence transitions into one showing Rivera at the barre in dance class, where she took ballet lessons three times a week under the tutelage of her mentor, Doris Jones. Chita shares the story of how Jones took her to <ref target="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</ref> to audition for <ref target="/wiki/George_Balanchine" title="George Balanchine">George Balanchine</ref> when she was 17. After noticing Chita's foot bleeding through her toe-shoe, Balanchine stopped to bandage her injury personally. After winning a scholarship to the <ref target="/wiki/School_of_American_Ballet" title="School of American Ballet">School of American Ballet</ref>, Chita accompanied a friend to an audition for a tour of <ref target="/wiki/Call_Me_Madam" title="Call Me Madam">Call Me Madam</ref>, starring <ref target="/wiki/Elaine_Stritch" title="Elaine Stritch">Elaine Stritch</ref>. Chita was hired, ending her career in classical ballet.</p>
<p>As a young "gypsy," Chita talks about her hope for a "crossover" - a featured bit of dancing or business to do while the scenery changes (“Something to Dance About”). Though she did not get one, she did get lessons in stage presence from Stritch, who told her to "make them hear you!" Still, she yearned for fame ("I'm Available").</p>
<p>In her first <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref> show, <ref class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Seventh_Heaven_(musical)&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Seventh Heaven (musical) (page does not exist)">Seventh Heaven</ref>, she plays a prostitute ("Camille, Colette, Fifi"). Later, she appears in <ref class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=The_Shoestring_Review&action=edit&redlink=1" title="The Shoestring Review (page does not exist)">The Shoestring Review</ref> with <ref target="/wiki/Bea_Arthur" title="Bea Arthur">Bea Arthur</ref>. Singing "Garbage", Chita reminisces about working with Arthur, who originally sang the number while Chita jumped in and out of a garbage bag- she jokes that the audience will have to "[leave] the jumping to our imaginations." The number segues into the title song of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Can-Can" title="Can-Can">Can-Can</ref>, where Chita is now a member of the chorus. Later, she joins the cast of <ref target="/wiki/Mr._Wonderful_(musical)" title="Mr. Wonderful (musical)">Mr. Wonderful</ref> ("Mr. Wonderful"), where she dates the young <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sammy_Davis,_Jr." title="Sammy Davis, Jr.">Sammy Davis, Jr.</ref></p>
<p>Chita recreates the audition that earned her the role of "Anita" in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/West_Side_Story_(musical)" title="West Side Story (musical)">West Side Story</ref>, her best-known role. After finding her audition piece, "My Man's Gone Now," laughable, <ref target="/wiki/Leonard_Bernstein" title="Leonard Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</ref> gives her "A Boy Like That" to sing. After several false starts, she lands the number and the role. Modern-day Chita then performs "America". Learning from <ref target="/wiki/Jerome_Robbins" title="Jerome Robbins">Jerome Robbins</ref> ("Jerry gave me detail, style, and substance") and <ref target="/wiki/Peter_Gennaro" title="Peter Gennaro">Peter Gennaro</ref> (the Sharks' own choreographer), Chita shows us "The Dance at the Gym" and performs "Somewhere" with the ensemble.</p>
<p>Chita then performs a sequence devoted to her various co-stars over the years, who all appear in silhouette. In <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bye_Bye_Birdie_(musical)" title="Bye Bye Birdie (musical)">Bye Bye Birdie</ref> there was <ref target="/wiki/Dick_Van_Dyke" title="Dick Van Dyke">Dick Van Dyke</ref> (for four performances, Van Dyke joined Rivera on stage) ("Put On A Happy Face" and "Rosie"). In <ref target="/wiki/The_Rink_(musical)" title="The Rink (musical)">The Rink</ref> there was <ref target="/wiki/Liza_Minnelli" title="Liza Minnelli">Liza Minnelli</ref> ("Don't Ah Ma Me"). <ref target="/wiki/Antonio_Banderas" title="Antonio Banderas">Antonio Banderas</ref> was her co-star in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nine_The_Musical" title="Nine The Musical">Nine The Musical</ref>, and <ref target="/wiki/Donald_O%27Connor" title="Donald O'Connor">Donald O'Connor</ref> co-starred in <ref target="/wiki/Bring_Back_Birdie" title="Bring Back Birdie">Bring Back Birdie</ref>. This leads to Chita's tribute to <ref target="/wiki/Gwen_Verdon" title="Gwen Verdon">Gwen Verdon</ref> - "as close as [she] will ever come to the magic of <ref target="/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</ref>" ("Hey Big Spender"). In the final section of Act I, Chita sings and dances "Nowadays" from <ref target="/wiki/Chicago_(musical)" title="Chicago (musical)">Chicago</ref>, alongside an empty spotlight representing the deceased Verdon. Chita turns to that spotlight when she sings, "but nothing stays."</p>

<p>Act II</p>
<p>Act II begins with a dance audition, during which the Puerto Rican Chita is rejected because she is "not Latin enough." An overhead mirror provides a view from above, and, proving she is "Latin enough," Chita dances several tangos opposite a male dancer ("Adios Niñino", "Detresse", and "Calambre"). This leads to further reminiscing about her great romances ("More Than You Know"). First, her ex-husband, <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Mordente" title="Tony Mordente">Tony Mordente</ref>, father of Chita's daughter Lisa. Then, the restaurateur Joe Allen, whom she nearly married. "To Tony, Tom, Joe, and Greg. And others... you know who you are!"</p>
<p>Next, Chita pays tribute to the choreographers in her life- <ref target="/wiki/Jack_Cole_(choreographer)" title="Jack Cole (choreographer)">Jack Cole</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Peter_Gennaro" title="Peter Gennaro">Peter Gennaro</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Bob_Fosse" title="Bob Fosse">Bob Fosse</ref>, and <ref target="/wiki/Jerome_Robbins" title="Jerome Robbins">Jerome Robbins</ref>- as she and the ensemble demonstrate their styles. The shadows of the ensemble cross in parade, demonstrating the individual styles of each choreographer. Then, Chita talks about some of her setbacks, including an automobile accident in which she broke her leg; losing the role of Anita to <ref target="/wiki/Rita_Moreno" title="Rita Moreno">Rita Moreno</ref> in the film of West Side Story; and Fosse's heart attack. But, she considers herself lucky through it all - especially due to her collaborations with <ref target="/wiki/John_Kander" title="John Kander">John Kander</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Fred_Ebb" title="Fred Ebb">Fred Ebb</ref>.</p>
<p>The song "A Woman the World Has Never Seen" wraps around a selection of Chita's greatest hits from her three <ref target="/wiki/Kander_and_Ebb" title="Kander and Ebb">Kander and Ebb</ref> roles: "Class" from Chicago, "Chief Cook and Bottle Washer" from <ref target="/wiki/The_Rink_(musical)" title="The Rink (musical)">The Rink</ref>, and "Kiss of the Spider Woman" and "Where You Are” from <ref target="/wiki/Kiss_of_the_Spider_Woman_(musical)" title="Kiss of the Spider Woman (musical)">Kiss of the Spider Woman</ref>. This brings Chita back to where she started - the White House, where she concludes with her trademark number, "All That Jazz", with "Little Chita" shadowing her again.</p>

<p>The musical first opened at the <ref target="/wiki/Old_Globe_Theatre" title="Old Globe Theatre">Old Globe Theatre</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/San_Diego" title="San Diego">San Diego</ref>, where it ran from September 10 to October 23, 2005.<ref target="#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> It then transferred to the <ref target="/wiki/Gerald_Schoenfeld_Theatre" title="Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre">Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre</ref> on <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref>, opening in previews on November 23, 2005, officially on December 11. The show closed after </p>
<p>72 performances and 20 previews. The play's Executive Producers were Marty Bell and Aldo Scrofani (the show credits 19 producers and associates). It was directed and choreographed by <ref target="/wiki/Graciela_Daniele" title="Graciela Daniele">Graciela Daniele</ref>, with reproductions of original choreography by <ref target="/wiki/Jerome_Robbins" title="Jerome Robbins">Jerome Robbins</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Bob_Fosse" title="Bob Fosse">Bob Fosse</ref> reconstructed by <ref target="/wiki/Alan_Johnson" title="Alan Johnson">Alan Johnson</ref> and Tony Stevens, respectively. Mark Hummel was musical director and arranger, as well as the orchestra's conductor, while orchestrations were provided by Danny Troob. Loy Arcenas (sets), Toni Leslie James (costumes), and Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer (lighting) comprised the show's design team.</p>
<p>After the show's closing on Broadway, Rivera toured throughout the United States during 2006 and 2007.<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> Major changes were made for the touring version of the show: the numbers "Can Can", "Don't 'Ah Ma' Me", and "Where You Are" were all dropped, as were the Act II-opening Tango sequence and the character of "Young Chita/Young Lisa." Of the Broadway cast, only Richard Amaro, Lloyd Culbreath, and Richard Montoya went on tour with Rivera. Notably, however, Rivera's daughter, <ref target="/wiki/Lisa_Mordente" title="Lisa Mordente">Lisa Mordente</ref>, joined the tour as dance captain and female swing. Cities on the tour included <ref target="/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Cleveland" title="Cleveland">Cleveland</ref>, and <ref target="/wiki/Boston" title="Boston">Boston</ref>. The tour concluded on June 10, 2007 in <ref target="/wiki/Norfolk,_Virginia" title="Norfolk, Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</ref>.</p>
<p>Since the ending of the tour, Rivera has performed a new solo cabaret act at the New York cabaret "Feinstein's at the Regency." Though this is not a recreation of The Dancer's Life, most of the songs and anecdotes featured in the cabaret (including the Ahrens & Flaherty songs) are the same as those in the Broadway show.</p>

<h2>Cast[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Chita_Rivera:_The_Dancer%27s_Life&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Cast">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>In addition to <ref target="/wiki/Chita_Rivera" title="Chita Rivera">Chita Rivera</ref> (playing herself), the original <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref> cast featured Liana Ortiz as both the young Rivera and as Rivera's daughter, <ref target="/wiki/Lisa_Mordente" title="Lisa Mordente">Lisa Mordente</ref>.

<h3>Critical reception[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Chita_Rivera:_The_Dancer%27s_Life&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: Critical reception">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>While the show won a great deal of praise for its 72-year-old star's performance, the "non-Chita" aspects of the show received little critical acclaim. In his review for TalkinBroadway.com, Matthew Murray referred to the show as a "stretch-mark-pocked retrospective," and called McNally's libretto "scattered" and Daniele's direction "busy but uninspired," while calling Rivera "terrific." <ref target="#cite_note-11">[11]</ref> David Rooney of <ref target="/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</ref> called the show "never less than enjoyable but too rarely exhilarating." He went on to say that McNally "[comes] off like a bumbling novice at theatricalizing a showbiz legend's life." <ref target="#cite_note-12">[12]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Ben_Brantley" title="Ben Brantley">Ben Brantley</ref> of <ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref> said "the production elements often dim rather than enhance Ms. Rivera's natural incandescence. Never entirely, though. Which means that The Dancer's Life remains a must-have ticket for aficionados of the American musical."<ref target="#cite_note-13">[13]</ref></p>
