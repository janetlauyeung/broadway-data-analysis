<p>Directed and choreographed by Luis Salgado, a member of the original Broadway Cast, and Assistant Latin Choreographer to Mr. Blankenbuehler, and presented by GALA Hispanic Theater, In The Heights had his Spanish Premiere in the US on April 2017. While Spanish-language versions of In the Heights have been produced in Latin America, this production is distinctive for several reasons: It is the first Spanish version of the show in the United States, it is the first Spanish translation sanctioned and approved by Lin-Manuel Miranda, and it is directed and choreographed by Luis Salgado, Assistant Latin Choreographer on the original Broadway production of In the Heights.<ref target="#cite_note-38">[38]</ref> The production included lyrics and scenes in Spanish, with elements from the original English, as well as an English anchor through the character of Benny. The production offered English and Spanish surtitles.</p>
<p>The production combined a varied Spanish speaking cast from countries including the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Spain, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Switzerland and the USA. It starred Juan Luis Espinal (Usnavi), Verónica Álvarez Robles (Vanessa), Laura Lebrón (Nina), Vaugh Midder (Benny), Scheherazade Quiroga (Daniela), Shadia Fairuz (Camila), Rafael Beato (Sonny), Michelle Ríos (Abuela Claudia), José Fernando Capellán (Kevin), Gabriella Pérez (Carla), Myriam Gadri (Graffity Pete) and Felix Marchany (Piragua Guy). The ensemble included: Ximena Salgado, Melinette Pallares, Natalia Raigosa, Amaya Perea, Aaron Cobos, José Ozuna and Hector Flores. The production garnered 18 nominations to the 2018 Helen Hayes Awards (the DC equivalent to the Tony Awards), more than any other DC production in the season,<ref target="#cite_note-39">[39]</ref> including Best Musical, Best Ensemble, Best Director, Best Choreography, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor among others.<ref target="#cite_note-40">[40]</ref></p>

<h2>Characters[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=In_the_Heights&action=edit&section=18" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Usnavi de la Vega is the narrator of the play's <ref target="/wiki/Exposition_(narrative)" title="Exposition (narrative)">exposition</ref> and a major character throughout; he is the owner of a small bodega in Washington Heights called De La Vega Bodega. He was originally played by Lin-Manuel Miranda, writer of the musical. He was named after one of the first sights his parents saw when they arrived in America, a ship with the sign "<ref target="/wiki/United_States_Navy" title="United States Navy">US Navy</ref>" on it. Abuela Claudia, the neighborhood matriarch, "practically raised" him when his parents both died during his early childhood. He dreams of moving to the <ref target="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</ref>. He is in love with Vanessa.</p>
<p>Nina Rosario is the first in her family (and from the Barrio) to go to college (<ref target="/wiki/Stanford_University" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</ref>), and everyone in the barrio admires her as the "one who made it out." However, she returns home from school for the summer to reluctantly tell her parents that she has become overburdened and dropped out. She is the typical "good girl" and always got along with her parents. Now, though, she loses patience constantly over her father's overprotectiveness and his refusal to accept Benny, with whom she gets into a romantic relationship.</p>
<p>Benny works at the dispatch of Nina's father, Kevin. The only character in the play who does not speak <ref target="/wiki/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</ref>, Benny falls in love with Nina. He dreams of opening his own business.</p>
<p>Vanessa is Usnavi's love interest who works at Daniela's salon. She is stunningly beautiful and catches the eye of every guy in the Heights, however, she takes interest in Usnavi. She lives with an alcoholic mother and dreams of getting out of the <ref target="/wiki/Barrio" title="Barrio">Barrio</ref> and getting an apartment downtown, but cannot yet afford it.</p>
<p>"Abuela" Claudia is the loving matriarch of the barrio who knows everybody and is like a grandmother to all ("abuela" means "grandmother" in Spanish). She is the one who looked after Usnavi when his parents died. She and her mother moved from <ref target="/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</ref> to New York in 1943 while she was a child. She worked as a maid for several years but never earned the money for her and her mother to travel home.</p>
<p>Sonny de la Vega is Usnavi's sassy, superficially lazy, yet ambitious younger cousin who works with Usnavi in the bodega. He is typically the jokester of the Barrio, but he also has an intelligent and thoughtful side that yearns for <ref target="/wiki/Social_justice" title="Social justice">social justice</ref>.</p>
<p>Daniela is the outrageously dramatic owner of the salon where the neighborhood girls come to gossip. She is very bold and loud and loves to banter.</p>
<p>Carla works at Daniela's salon along with Vanessa, and is Daniela's close friend; young and pretty, but a little slow to get the others' jokes and innuendos, she is of <ref target="/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chilean</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuban</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican</ref>, and <ref target="/wiki/Puerto_Rico" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rican</ref> descent.</p>
<p>Kevin Rosario is Nina's overprotective father, who, coming from a long line of farmers, has worked hard to resist following in his own father's footsteps. He now owns his own taxi cab service: Rosario's.</p>
<p>Camila Rosario is Nina's strong-willed mother, who wants what is best for Nina. She is typically tolerant of Kevin's control issues, but in the course of the show, reveals her real feelings.</p>
<p>Piragua Guy (Piragüero) is the owner of a small <ref target="/wiki/Piragua_(food)" title="Piragua (food)">piragua</ref> stand that competes with <ref target="/wiki/Mister_Softee" title="Mister Softee">Mister Softee</ref>.</p>
<p>Graffiti Pete is a <ref target="/wiki/Graffiti" title="Graffiti">graffiti</ref> artist. He is good friends with Sonny and is one of the few characters who acknowledge Sonny's dreams. Usnavi believes Pete is a trouble-making vandal (constantly referring to him as a 'punk'), until Pete reveals his amazing skills as an artist.</p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Set_and_stage_for_In_The_Heights_2017.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Set_and_stage_for_In_The_Heights_2017.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>The set and stage for In the Heights at the Wheelock Family Theatre at <ref target="/wiki/Wheelock_College" title="Wheelock College">Wheelock College</ref>.
<p>As the sun rises on the hottest day of the summer, Usnavi de la Vega, the owner of a small bodega in <ref target="/wiki/Washington_Heights,_Manhattan" title="Washington Heights, Manhattan">Washington Heights</ref>, chases away a small-time vandal, Graffiti Pete, before introducing the audience to the corner he lives on and some of its many residents: Abuela Claudia, a matriarchal figure who helped to raise Usnavi among others; Usnavi's young, lazy cousin Sonny who helps run the bodega; Daniela and Carla, who run the local salon; and Kevin and Camila Rosario, who run the cab company (“In the Heights”). As the day begins, the Rosarios’ daughter Nina arrives home from her first year at <ref target="/wiki/Stanford_University" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</ref>. Often considered the “one who made it out” and the pride of the corner, Nina dreads telling her parents and neighbors the truth of her return home: that she dropped out of Stanford because she had to work two jobs to maintain her tuition, leading to her getting poor grades and losing her scholarship (“Breathe”). As she tries to find her parents to tell them the news, she runs into Benny, Usnavi's best friend and an employee of Kevin's who has been temporarily left in charge of the dispatch while Kevin seeks to solve a financial problem. Clearly harboring latent romantic feelings for one another, Benny and Nina reconnect (“Benny’s Dispatch”). Elsewhere, Vanessa, an employee of Daniela's at the salon (and with whom Usnavi had long been infatuated), dreams of one day leaving the corner and getting an apartment in the <ref target="/wiki/West_Village" title="West Village">West Village</ref> (“It Won’t Be Long Now”). While she is on a break at the salon, Sonny asks her out on a date on Usnavi's behalf, and she accepts; Usnavi rejoices at his success but worries that Vanessa may forget about him and the rest of the community when she moves.</p>
<p>Nina reunites with her parents and is ultimately forced to reveal that she dropped out. Her parents are stunned at this revelation (as well as her dishonesty) and Kevin grows devastated that he has been unable to provide for his family, fearing that he has continued the cycle started by his deadbeat father (“Inútil”). Nina escapes to the salon to seek comfort from Vanessa, but Daniela and Carla insist on giving her a makeover and subjecting her to their gossip about the goings-on in the neighborhood, specifically about Nina and Vanessa's respective love interests (“No Me Diga”). The attention turns once more to Nina and her successes, however, forcing Nina to reveal the truth once more about Stanford and leave exasperatedly.</p>
<p>As Usnavi closes up shop, he, Benny, Sonny, and Graffiti Pete discover that the bodega has sold a winning <ref target="/wiki/Lottery" title="Lottery">lottery</ref> ticket worth $96,000. They and soon the rest of the block begin to fantasize about what they would do if they won the small fortune (“96,000”). As the excitement dies down, Abuela Claudia sits down to feed the birds and reminisces about her childhood in Cuba and her life in relative poverty, and the events that have led her to where she is today. With tears of gratitude, she reveals that she holds the winning lottery ticket, and thanks her years of patience and faith for bringing her this fortune (“Paciencia y Fe”). Elsewhere, Nina finds solace in Benny, who takes her on a walk down the street corner and reminisces with her, reminding her of her childhood and her home. Nina expresses her doubts about her own self-worth to Benny, but he reassures her that she is destined for greatness (“When You’re Home”). As they head to Nina's house for dinner, the local Piragua Guy continues his day selling <ref target="/wiki/Piragua_(food)" title="Piragua (food)">piraguas</ref> through the intense heat and competing with <ref target="/wiki/Mister_Softee" title="Mister Softee">Mister Softee</ref> (“Piragua”).</p>
<p>Kevin and Camila host Nina, Benny, Usnavi, Vanessa, and Abuela Claudia for dinner where Kevin makes an announcement: he has sold the car service to pay for Nina's tuition. Nina and Camila are shocked but Benny, who had long dreamed of taking over the car service, is outraged and confronts Kevin over his decision. Kevin insists that Rosario's is a family business and that Benny will never be family; Benny subsequently leaves in a huff and Nina, refusing to accept the money, follows him out. Usnavi soon arrives at a local club for his date with Vanessa, but is overly nervous and aloof, leading Vanessa to dance with other guys to make him jealous; Usnavi soon finds his own dance partner and tries to make Vanessa jealous in turn. Nina follows Benny to the club to apologize for her father's decision but Benny, already drunk, angrily brushes her off (“The Club”). Tensions rise in the club as the two couples cope with their own jealousy, culminating in Benny punching a man dancing with Nina, causing a fight to break out. Suddenly, the <ref target="/wiki/Power_outage" title="Power outage">power goes out throughout the city</ref> as a result of the intense heat and humidity. The neighborhood descends into chaos as Usnavi and Vanessa, as well as Benny and Nina, desperately try to find their way back to one another. Sonny and Graffiti Pete, fearing looters, set off fireworks to distract potential robbers as well as to light everyone else's way home. Usnavi reunites with Abuela Claudia, who shows him her lottery winnings, and Benny and Nina find each other amid the chaos, and despite initially arguing, they finally kiss (“Blackout”).</p>

<h3>Act 2[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=In_the_Heights&action=edit&section=21" title="Edit section: Act 2">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Nina and Benny spend the night together in Benny's apartment as Kevin frantically searches for her all night; Benny worries what Kevin will say about their relationship but is happy to finally be with her (“Sunrise”). Down the street, Usnavi, whose bodega has in fact been looted, convenes with Abuela Claudia to discuss what will happen with the money. Abuela Claudia decides to give Usnavi a third of the money and urges him to use it to achieve his lifelong dream of returning to his home in the <ref target="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</ref>. While Usnavi shares some doubts, he eventually decides to go (“Hundreds of Stories”). Nina eventually returns home to find her parents worried sick about her, and Kevin grows furious when he learns she was with Benny, disapproving of their relationship due to Benny's not being <ref target="/wiki/Latino" title="Latino">Latino</ref>. Nina and Kevin loudly argue before Camila intervenes, criticizing both Kevin for throwing Benny out and Nina for not coming home. She urges them to come together and work things out as a family (“Enough”).</p>
<p>As the neighborhood copes with their frustration over the heat and blackout, Daniela urges them to dispel the negativity and muster up enough energy for a neighborhood celebration. As the block reluctantly begins making the most of a bad situation, Daniela leads the crowd in mocking Vanessa for not realizing Usnavi's feelings for her as well as Benny for his tryst with Nina the previous night. Usnavi soon emerges and announces Abuela Claudia's winning of the lottery as well as their flight for the Dominican Republic the following day. Vanessa is visibly upset by his leaving, and so is Sonny, who has long had a crush on Nina and whose only close relative is Usnavi. Usnavi calms Sonny down by revealing that they plan to give him a third of the lottery winnings and begins to rouse excitement throughout the block once more by encouraging them to celebrate before everything changes (“Carnaval del Barrio”).</p>
<p>As they continue dancing and celebrating, a visibly upset Nina arrives and pulls Usnavi offstage, and soon Kevin makes an announcement over the dispatch: Abuela Claudia has suddenly died (“Atención”). Usnavi holds an impromptu memorial for Abuela Claudia, revealing that she died of “a combination of the stress and heat,” and soon Nina leads the entire block in singing Abuela's praises (“Alabanza”). Afterward, Usnavi and Nina go through Abuela's old photographs to reminisce. Nina begins to remember the central role Abuela Claudia played in her education and motivation, and in memory of Abuela, she resolves to accept her parents’ money and give college another try, returning to Stanford at the end of the summer (“Everything I Know”). As Vanessa prepares to move out, Daniela gives her a final piece of news: Usnavi convinced Daniela to cosign Vanessa's lease for her new apartment (“No Me Diga (Reprise)”). As the blackout continues, the Piragua Guy rejoices in the effect the heat has had on his business (“Piragua (Reprise)”).</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by his kind act, Vanessa visits a flustered Usnavi as he cleans up the bodega and flirts with him, offering him a bottle of champagne. She quietly suggests to the distracted Usnavi that he should stay in the neighborhood, worried that if he leaves that she will never see him again, but Usnavi, overwhelmed, firmly rejects this. Vanessa kisses him before leaving, lamenting that she was too late in realizing her feelings for him (“Champagne”). As Nina tells Benny of her decision, they agree to spend the summer together before pursuing a long-distance relationship when she returns to school; Benny reaffirms his faith in her and they promise to think of one another every day while they are apart (“When The Sun Goes Down”). Benny confronts Kevin for a final time, insisting that he was always there for him while Kevin never did the same. As the night winds down, Sonny approaches Graffiti Pete with a secret proposition, which Pete accepts.</p>
<p>The next morning the neighborhood has visibly changed: the car service sign over the Rosarios’ building has been removed and the grate in front of the bodega is still open. As Usnavi plays Abuela Claudia's old records, he comes to terms with the fact that the corner is about to change, and wonders if anyone will notice that he's gone in the long run. Before he leaves, Sonny approaches him and, having fixed the bodega's grate, pulls it down, revealing a graffiti mural of Abuela Claudia painted by Pete. Seeing the mural, Usnavi has an <ref target="/wiki/Epiphany_(feeling)" title="Epiphany (feeling)">epiphany</ref> and tasks Sonny and Graffiti Pete with telling the neighborhood of his decision to stay. As he reflects on his role as the neighborhood's storyteller, Usnavi ponders a potential future with Vanessa as he strives to ensure that his family's legacy is remembered and accepts the corner as his true home (“Finale”).</p>
