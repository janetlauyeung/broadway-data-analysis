<p>Enron Corporation was an <ref target="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">American</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Energy_development" title="Energy development">energy</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Commodity" title="Commodity">commodities</ref>, and services company based in <ref target="/wiki/Houston" title="Houston">Houston</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</ref>. It was founded in 1985 as a merger between <ref target="/wiki/Houston_Natural_Gas" title="Houston Natural Gas">Houston Natural Gas</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/InterNorth" title="InterNorth">InterNorth</ref>, both relatively small regional companies. Before its bankruptcy on December 3, 2001, Enron employed approximately 29,000 staff and was a major <ref target="/wiki/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</ref>, communications and <ref target="/wiki/Pulp_and_paper_industry" title="Pulp and paper industry">pulp and paper</ref> company, with claimed revenues of nearly $101 billion during 2000.<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)" title="Fortune (magazine)">Fortune</ref> named Enron "America's Most Innovative Company" for six consecutive years.</p>
<p>At the end of 2001, it was revealed that Enron's reported financial condition was sustained by institutionalized, systematic, and creatively planned <ref target="/wiki/Accounting_scandals" title="Accounting scandals">accounting fraud</ref>, known since as the <ref target="/wiki/Enron_scandal" title="Enron scandal">Enron scandal</ref>. Enron has since become a well-known example of willful corporate <ref target="/wiki/Fraud" title="Fraud">fraud</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Corporate_crime" title="Corporate crime">corruption</ref>. The scandal also brought into question the accounting practices and activities of many corporations in the <ref target="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</ref> and was a factor in the enactment of the <ref target="/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act" title="Sarbanes–Oxley Act">Sarbanes–Oxley Act</ref> of 2002. The scandal also affected the greater business world by causing the dissolution of the <ref target="/wiki/Arthur_Andersen" title="Arthur Andersen">Arthur Andersen</ref> accounting firm, which had been Enron's main auditor for years.<ref target="#cite_note-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>Enron filed for bankruptcy in the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Southern_District_of_New_York" title="Southern District of New York">Southern District of New York</ref> in late 2001 and selected <ref target="/wiki/Weil,_Gotshal_%26_Manges" title="Weil, Gotshal & Manges">Weil, Gotshal & Manges</ref> as its bankruptcy counsel. It ended its bankruptcy during November 2004, pursuant to a court-approved plan of reorganization. A new board of directors changed the name of Enron to Enron Creditors Recovery Corp., and emphasized reorganizing and liquidating certain operations and assets of the pre-bankruptcy Enron.<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> On September 7, 2006, Enron sold <ref target="/wiki/Prisma_Energy_International" title="Prisma Energy International">Prisma Energy International Inc.</ref>, its last remaining business, to Ashmore Energy International Ltd.

<h3>Pre-merger origins (1925–1985)[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Pre-merger origins (1925–1985)">edit</ref>]</h3>
<h4>InterNorth[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: InterNorth">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>One of Enron's primary predecessors was the Northern Natural Gas Company, which was formed in 1930, in <ref target="/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska" title="Omaha, Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</ref> just a few months after <ref target="/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929" title="Wall Street Crash of 1929">Black Tuesday</ref>. The low cost of natural gas and cheap labor supply during the Great Depression helped to fuel the company's early beginnings. The company doubled in size by 1932 and was able to bring the first natural gas to <ref target="/wiki/Minnesota" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</ref>. Over the next 50 years, Northern expanded even more as it acquired many energy companies and created new divisions within. It was reorganized in 1979 as the main subsidiary of a <ref target="/wiki/Holding_company" title="Holding company">holding company</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/InterNorth" title="InterNorth">InterNorth</ref>, which was a diversified energy and energy-related products company. Although most of the acquisitions conducted were successful, some ended poorly. InterNorth competed with <ref target="/wiki/Cooper_Industries" title="Cooper Industries">Cooper Industries</ref> over a hostile takeover of <ref target="/wiki/Crouse-Hinds_Company" title="Crouse-Hinds Company">Crouse-Hinds Company</ref>, an electrical products manufacturer. InterNorth was ultimately unsuccessful as Cooper bought out Crouse-Hinds. Cooper and InterNorth feuded over numerous suits during the course of the takeover that were eventually settled after the transaction was completed. The subsidiary Northern Natural Gas operated the largest natural gas pipeline company in North America. By the 1980s, InterNorth became a major force for natural gas production, transmission, and marketing as well as for natural gas liquids, and was an innovator in the <ref target="/wiki/Plastics_industry" title="Plastics industry">plastics industry</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-:3-5">[5]</ref> In 1983, InterNorth merged with the Belco Petroleum Company, a <ref target="/wiki/Fortune_500" title="Fortune 500">Fortune 500</ref> oil exploration and development company founded by <ref target="/wiki/Arthur_Belfer" title="Arthur Belfer">Arthur Belfer</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-Funding-6">[6]</ref></p>

<h4>Houston Natural Gas[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Houston Natural Gas">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>The <ref target="/wiki/Houston_Natural_Gas" title="Houston Natural Gas">Houston Natural Gas</ref> (HNG) corporation was initially formed from the Houston Oil Co. in 1925 to provide gas to customers in the Houston market through the building of <ref target="/wiki/Pipeline_transport" title="Pipeline transport">gas pipelines</ref>. Under the leadership of CEO Robert Herring from 1967 to 1981, the company became a large dominant force in the energy industry with a large pipeline network as a result from a prosperous period of growth in the early to mid-1970s. This growth was largely a result of the exploitation of the unregulated Texas natural gas market and the commodity surge in the early 1970s. Toward the end of the 1970s, HNG's luck began to run out with rising gas prices forcing clients to switch to oil. In addition, with the passing of the <ref class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Natural_Gas_Policy_Act_of_1978&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (page does not exist)">Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978</ref>, the Texas market was more difficult to profit from and as a result, HNG's profits fell. After Herring's death in 1981, <ref class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=M.D._Matthews&action=edit&redlink=1" title="M.D. Matthews (page does not exist)">M.D. Matthews</ref> briefly took over as CEO in a 3-year stint with initial success, but ultimately, a big dip in earnings led to his exit. In 1984, <ref target="/wiki/Kenneth_Lay" title="Kenneth Lay">Kenneth Lay</ref> succeeded Matthews and inherited the troubled, but large diversified energy conglomerate.<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>

<h4>Merger[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Merger">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>InterNorth, in its conservative success, became a target of corporate takeovers, the most prominent being corporate raider <ref target="/wiki/Irwin_L._Jacobs" title="Irwin L. Jacobs">Irwin Jacobs.</ref><ref target="#cite_note-:0-8">[8]</ref> InterNorth CEO Sam Segnar, in searching for a company to merge with to fend off takeover attempts as a poison pill, discovered HNG. In May 1985, Internorth acquired HNG for $2.3 billion, 40% higher than the current market price,<ref target="#cite_note-:1-9">[9]</ref> in order to avoid the corporate takeover attempt. The combined assets of the two companies would create the second largest gas pipeline system at the time in the United States.<ref target="#cite_note-:2-10">[10]</ref> Internorth’s north-south pipelines that served Iowa and Minnesota complemented HNG’s Florida and California east-west pipelines well.<ref target="#cite_note-:1-9">[9]</ref></p>

<h3>Post-merger rise (1985–1991)[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Post-merger rise (1985–1991)">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The company was initially named "HNG/InterNorth Inc.", even though InterNorth was technically the parent.<ref target="#cite_note-:2-10">[10]</ref> At the outset, Segnar was CEO for a short time, before he was fired by the Board of Directors whereupon Lay was tapped to be the new CEO. Lay moved the headquarters of the new company back to energy capital Houston. The company then set out to find a new name, spent upwards of $100,000 in focus groups and consulting before "Enteron" was suggested. The name was eventually dismissed over its apparent likening to an intestine and shortened to "Enron."<ref target="#cite_note-:0-8">[8]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-:1-9">[9]</ref> (The distinctive logo was one of the final major projects of legendary graphic designer <ref target="/wiki/Paul_Rand" title="Paul Rand">Paul Rand</ref> before his death in 1996.)<ref target="#cite_note-11">[11]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-12">[12]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> Enron still had some lingering problems left over from its merger, however. The company had to pay Jacobs, who was still a threat, over $350 million and reorganize the company.<ref target="#cite_note-:0-8">[8]</ref> Lay sold off any parts of the company that he believed didn't belong in the long-term future of Enron. Lay consolidated all the gas pipeline efforts under the Enron Gas Pipeline Operating Company. In addition, the company began to ramp up its electric power and natural gas efforts. In 1988 and 1989, the company began adding power plants and <ref target="/wiki/Cogeneration" title="Cogeneration">cogeneration</ref> units to its portfolio. In 1989, <ref target="/wiki/Jeffrey_Skilling" title="Jeffrey Skilling">Jeffrey Skilling</ref>, then a consultant at <ref target="/wiki/McKinsey_%26_Company" title="McKinsey & Company">McKinsey & Company</ref>, came up with the idea to link natural gas to consumers in more ways, effectively turning natural gas into a commodity. Enron adopted the idea and called it the "Gas Bank." The division's success prompted Skilling to join Enron as the head of the Gas Bank in 1991.<ref target="#cite_note-:2-10">[10]</ref> Another major development inside Enron was the beginning of the company's pivot to overseas that was expanded upon in the 1990s. Starting in 1989, the company received a $56 million loan from the <ref target="/wiki/Overseas_Private_Investment_Corporation" title="Overseas Private Investment Corporation">Overseas Private Investment Corporation</ref> (OPIC) for a power plant in Argentina.<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Enron_Complex.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Enron_Complex.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref><ref target="/wiki/1400_Smith_Street" title="1400 Smith Street">Enron Complex</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/Downtown_Houston" title="Downtown Houston">Downtown Houston</ref>.</p>

As a result of these orders, more than 75% of gas sales are conducted through the spot market, and unprecedented market volatility exists.<ref target="#cite_note-fusaro-14">[14]</ref></p>

<h3>1991–2000[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=18" title="Edit section: 1991–2000">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Over the course of the 1990s, Enron made a few changes to its business plan that greatly improved the perceived profitability of the company. First, Enron invested heavily in overseas assets, specifically energy. Another major shift was the gradual transition of focus from a producer of energy to a company that acted more like an investment firm and sometimes a <ref target="/wiki/Hedge_fund" title="Hedge fund">hedge fund</ref>, making profits off the margins of the products it traded. These products were traded through the Gas Bank concept, now called the Enron Finance Corp. headed by Skilling.<ref target="#cite_note-:0-8">[8]</ref></p>

<h4>Operations as a trading firm[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=19" title="Edit section: Operations as a trading firm">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>With the success of the Gas Bank trading natural gas, Skilling looked to expand the horizons of his division, Enron Capital & Trade. Skilling hired <ref target="/wiki/Andrew_Fastow" title="Andrew Fastow">Andrew Fastow</ref> in 1990 to help with this.</p>

<h4>Entrance into the retail energy market[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=20" title="Edit section: Entrance into the retail energy market">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>Starting in 1994 under the <ref target="/wiki/Energy_Policy_Act_of_1992" title="Energy Policy Act of 1992">Energy Policy Act of 1992</ref>, Congress allowed states to deregulate their electricity utilities, allowing them to be opened for competition. California was one such state to do so. Enron, seeing an opportunity with rising prices, was eager to jump into the market. In 1997, Enron acquired <ref target="/wiki/Portland_General_Electric" title="Portland General Electric">Portland General Electric</ref> (PGE). Although an Oregon utility, it had potential to begin serving the massive California market since PGE was a regulated utility. The new Enron division, Enron Energy, ramped up its efforts by offering discounts to potential customers in California for switching their electric supplier to Enron from their previous supplier, starting in 1998. Enron Energy also began to sell natural gas to customers in Ohio and wind power in Iowa. However, in 1999, the company ended its retail endeavor, only offering wholesale energy as it was revealed it was spending upwards of $100 million a year.<ref target="#cite_note-:3-5">[5]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-:0-8">[8]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-:2-10">[10]</ref></p>

<h4>Data management[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=21" title="Edit section: Data management">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>As fiber optic technology progressed in the 1990s, multiple companies, including Enron, attempted to make money by "keeping the continuing network costs low," which was done by owning their own network.<ref target="#cite_note-NYT1999-17">[17]</ref> In 1997, FTV Communications LLC, a <ref target="/wiki/Limited_liability_company" title="Limited liability company">limited liability company</ref> formed by Enron subsidiary FirstPoint Communications, Inc., <ref target="/wiki/Williams_Companies" title="Williams Companies">Williams Communications Group, Inc.</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Montana_Power_Company" title="Montana Power Company">Touch America</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-PRNEWS-18">[18]</ref> FTV constructed a 1,380 mile fiber optic network between Portland and Las Vegas.<ref target="#cite_note-PRNEWS-18">[18]</ref> In 1998, Enron constructed a building in a rundown area of Las Vegas near E Sahara, building right over the "backbone" of fiber optic cables providing service to technology companies nationwide.<ref target="#cite_note-NPR04-19">[19]</ref> The location had the ability to send "the entire Library of Congress anywhere in the world within minutes" and could stream "video to the whole state of California."<ref target="#cite_note-NPR04-19">[19]</ref> The location was also more protected from natural disasters than areas such as Los Angeles or the East Coast.<ref target="#cite_note-NPR04-19">[19]</ref> According to Wall Street Daily, "Enron had a secret," it "wanted to trade bandwidth like it traded oil, gas, electricity, etc. It launched a secret plan to build an enormous amount of fiber optic transmission capacity in Las Vegas ... it was all part of Enron’s plan to essentially own the internet."<ref target="#cite_note-WSdaily-20">[20]</ref> Enron sought to have all US internet service providers rely on their Nevada facility to supply bandwidth, which Enron would sell in a fashion similar to other commodities.<ref target="#cite_note-REG2008-21">[21]</ref></p>
<p>In January 2000, Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling announced to analysts that they were going to open trading for their own "high-speed fiber-optic networks that form the backbone for Internet traffic". Investors quickly bought Enron stock following the announcement "<ref target="/wiki/Dot-com_bubble" title="Dot-com bubble">as they did with most things Internet-related at the time</ref>", with stock prices rising from $40 per share in January 2000 to $70 per share in March, peaking at $90 in the summer of 2000. Enron executives obtained <ref target="/wiki/Windfall_gain" title="Windfall gain">windfall gains</ref> from the rising stock prices, with a total of $924 million of stocks sold by high-level Enron employees between 2000 and 2001. Head of Enron Broadband Services, Kenneth Rice, sold 1 million shares himself, earning about $70 million in returns. As prices of existing fiber optic cables plummeted due to the vast oversupply of the system, with only 5% of the 40 million miles being active wires, Enron purchased the inactive "dark fibers", expecting to buy them at low cost and then make a profit as the need for more usage by internet providers increased, with Enron expecting to lease its acquired dark fibers in 20 year contracts to providers. However, Enron's accounting would use estimates to determine how much their dark fiber would be worth when "lit" and apply those estimates to their current income, adding exaggerated revenue to their accounts since transactions were not yet made and it was not known if the cables would ever be active. Enron's trading with other energy companies within the broadband market was its attempt to lure large telecommunications companies, such as <ref target="/wiki/Verizon_Communications" title="Verizon Communications">Verizon Communications</ref>, into its broadband scheme to create its own new market.<ref target="#cite_note-WPjan01-22">[22]</ref></p>
<p>By the second quarter of 2001, Enron Broadband Services was reporting losses. On March 12, 2001, a proposed 20-year deal between Enron and <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Blockbuster_Inc." title="Blockbuster Inc.">Blockbuster Inc.</ref> to stream <ref target="/wiki/Video_on_demand" title="Video on demand">movies on demand</ref> over Enron's connections was cancelled, with Enron shares dropping from $80 per share in mid-February 2001 to below $60 the week after the deal was killed. The branch of the company that Jeffrey Skilling "said would eventually add $40 billion to Enron's stock value" added only about $408 million in revenue for Enron in 2001, with the company's broadband arm closed shortly after its meager second-quarter earnings report in July 2001.<ref target="#cite_note-WPjan01-22">[22]</ref></p>
<p>Following the bankruptcy of Enron, telecommunications holdings were sold for "pennies on the dollar."<ref target="#cite_note-NPR04-19">[19]</ref> In 2002, Rob Roy of <ref target="/wiki/Switch_(company)" title="Switch (company)">Switch Communications</ref> purchased Enron's Nevada facility in an auction attended only by Roy. Enron's "fiber plans were so secretive that few people even knew about the auction." The facility was sold for only $930,000.<ref target="#cite_note-NPR04-19">[19]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-WSdaily-20">[20]</ref> Following the sale, Switch expanded to control "the biggest data center in the world."<ref target="#cite_note-WSdaily-20">[20]</ref></p>

<h4>Overseas expansion[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=22" title="Edit section: Overseas expansion">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>Enron, seeing stability after the merger, began to look overseas for new possible energy opportunities in 1991. Enron's first such opportunity was a <ref target="/wiki/Teesside_power_station" title="Teesside power station">natural gas power plant</ref> utilizing cogeneration that the company built in <ref target="/wiki/Teesside" title="Teesside">Teesside, UK</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-:3-5">[5]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-:1-9">[9]</ref> The power plant was so large it could produce up to 3% of the United Kingdom's electricity demand with a capacity of over 1,875 <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatts" title="Megawatts">megawatts</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-23">[23]</ref> Seeing the success in England, the company developed and diversified its assets worldwide under the name of Enron International (EI), headed by former HNG executive <ref target="/wiki/Rebecca_Mark-Jusbasche" title="Rebecca Mark-Jusbasche">Rebecca Mark</ref>. By 1994, EI's portfolio included assets in The Philippines, Australia, Guatemala, Germany, France, India, Argentina, the Caribbean, China, England, Colombia, Turkey, Bolivia, Brazil, Indonesia, Norway, Poland, and Japan. The division was becoming a large share of earnings for Enron, contributing 25% of earnings in 1996. Mark and EI believed the water industry was the next market to be deregulated by authorities and seeing the potential, searched for ways to enter the market, similar to PGE.</p>
<p>In 1998, Enron International acquired <ref target="/wiki/Wessex_Water" title="Wessex Water">Wessex Water</ref> for $2.88 billion.<ref target="#cite_note-24">[24]</ref> Wessex Water became the core asset of a new company, Azurix, which expanded to other water companies.

<p>Enron was originally involved in transmitting and distributing electricity and natural gas throughout the United States.

<p>As was later discovered, many of Enron's recorded assets and profits were inflated or even wholly fraudulent and nonexistent. One example of fraudulent records was during 1999 when Enron promised to repay <ref target="/wiki/Merrill_Lynch" title="Merrill Lynch">Merrill Lynch</ref>'s investment with interest in order to show a profit on its books. Debts and losses were put into entities formed "offshore" that were not included in the company's <ref target="/wiki/Financial_statement" title="Financial statement">financial statements</ref>, and other sophisticated and arcane financial transactions between Enron and related companies were used to eliminate unprofitable entities from the company's books.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>]</p>

<p>As the scandal progressed, Enron share prices decreased from US $90.56 during the summer of 2000, to just pennies.<ref target="#cite_note-33">[33]</ref> Enron had been considered a <ref target="/wiki/Blue_chip_(stock_market)" title="Blue chip (stock market)">blue chip</ref> stock investment, so this was an unprecedented event in the financial world.

<h3>Accounting practices[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=25" title="Edit section: Accounting practices">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Enron used a variety of deceptive, bewildering, and fraudulent accounting practices and tactics to cover its fraud in reporting Enron's financial information. Special-purpose entities were created to mask significant liabilities from Enron's financial statements. These entities made Enron seem more profitable than it actually was, and created a dangerous spiral in which, each quarter, corporate officers would have to perform more and more financial deception to create the illusion of billions of dollars in profit while the company was actually losing money.<ref target="#cite_note-35">[35]</ref> This practice increased their stock price to new levels, at which point the executives began to work on <ref target="/wiki/Insider_trading" title="Insider trading">insider information</ref> and trade millions of dollars' worth of Enron stock. The executives and insiders at Enron knew about the offshore accounts that were hiding losses for the company; the investors, however, did not. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow directed the team which created the off-books companies, and manipulated the deals to provide himself, his family, and his friends with hundreds of millions of dollars in guaranteed revenue, at the expense of the corporation for which he worked and its stockholders.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>]</p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Arthur_Andersen_Witnesses.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Arthur_Andersen_Witnesses.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>Arthur Andersen Witnesses
<p>During 1999, Enron initiated EnronOnline, an Internet-based trading operation, which was used by virtually every energy company in the United States. By promoting the company's aggressive investment strategy, Enron president and chief operating officer <ref target="/wiki/Jeffrey_Skilling" title="Jeffrey Skilling">Jeffrey Skilling</ref> helped make Enron the biggest wholesaler of gas and electricity, trading over $27 billion per quarter. The corporation's financial claims, however, had to be accepted at face value. Under Skilling, Enron adopted <ref target="/wiki/Mark-to-market_accounting" title="Mark-to-market accounting">mark-to-market accounting</ref>, in which anticipated future profits from any deal were tabulated as if currently real. Thus, Enron could record gains from what over time might turn out to be losses, as the company's fiscal health became secondary to manipulating its stock price on <ref target="/wiki/Wall_Street" title="Wall Street">Wall Street</ref> during the so-called <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tech_boom" title="Tech boom">Tech boom</ref>.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>] But when a company's success is measured by undocumented financial statements, actual balance sheets are inconvenient. Indeed, Enron's unscrupulous actions were often gambles to keep the deception going and so increase the stock price. An advancing price meant a continued infusion of investor capital on which debt-ridden Enron in large part subsisted (much like a financial "pyramid" or "<ref target="/wiki/Ponzi_scheme" title="Ponzi scheme">Ponzi scheme</ref>"). Attempting to maintain the illusion, Skilling verbally attacked Wall Street Analyst Richard Grubman,<ref target="#cite_note-million-36">[36]</ref> who questioned Enron's unusual accounting practice during a recorded conference telephone call. When Grubman complained that Enron was the only company that could not release a balance sheet along with its earnings statements, Skilling replied, "Well, thank you very much, we appreciate that ... asshole." Though the comment was met with dismay and astonishment by press and public, it became an inside joke among many Enron employees, mocking Grubman for his perceived meddling rather than Skilling's offensiveness.<ref target="#cite_note-37">[37]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-38">[38]</ref> When asked during his trial, Skilling declared that industrial dominance and abuse was a global problem: "Oh yes, yes sure, it is."<ref target="#cite_note-mclean-25">[25]</ref></p>

<h3>Post-bankruptcy[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=26" title="Edit section: Post-bankruptcy">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Enron initially planned to retain its three domestic pipeline companies as well as most of its overseas assets. However, before emerging from bankruptcy, Enron sold its domestic pipeline companies as CrossCountry Energy for $2.45 billion <ref target="#cite_note-39">[39]</ref> and later sold other assets to <ref target="/wiki/Vulcan_Capital_Management" title="Vulcan Capital Management">Vulcan Capital Management</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-40">[40]</ref></p>
<p>Enron sold its last business, <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Prisma_Energy" title="Prisma Energy">Prisma Energy</ref>, during 2006, leaving Enron asset-less.<ref target="#cite_note-41">[41]</ref> During early 2007, its name was changed to Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation. Its goal is to repay the old Enron's remaining creditors and end Enron's affairs.</p>
<ref target="/wiki/Azurix" title="Azurix">Azurix</ref>, the former water utility part of the company, remains under Enron ownership, although it is currently asset-less. It is involved in several litigations against the government of <ref target="/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</ref> claiming compensation relating to the negligence and corruption of the local governance during its management of the <ref target="/wiki/Buenos_Aires" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</ref> water concession during 1999, which resulted in substantial amounts of debt (approx. $620 million) and the eventual collapse of the branch.<ref target="#cite_note-42">[42]</ref>
<p>Soon after emerging from bankruptcy during November 2004, Enron's new board of directors sued 11 financial institutions for helping Lay, Fastow, Skilling and others hide Enron's true financial condition. The proceedings were dubbed the "megaclaims litigation." Among the defendants were <ref target="/wiki/Royal_Bank_of_Scotland" title="Royal Bank of Scotland">Royal Bank of Scotland</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Deutsche_Bank" title="Deutsche Bank">Deutsche Bank</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Citigroup" title="Citigroup">Citigroup</ref>. As of 2008<ref class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit">[update]</ref>, Enron has settled with all of the institutions, ending with Citigroup. Enron was able to obtain nearly $7.2 billion to distribute to its creditors as a result of the megaclaims litigation.<ref target="#cite_note-43">[43]</ref> As of December 2009, some claim and process payments were still being distributed.</p>
<p>Enron has been featured since its bankruptcy in popular culture, including in <ref target="/wiki/The_Simpsons" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</ref> episodes <ref target="/wiki/That_%2790s_Show" title="That '90s Show">That '90s Show</ref> (Homer buys Enron stocks while Marge chooses to keep her own <ref target="/wiki/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</ref> stocks) and <ref target="/wiki/Special_Edna" title="Special Edna">Special Edna</ref>, which features a scene of an Enron-themed amusement park ride. The 2007 film <ref target="/wiki/Bee_Movie" title="Bee Movie">Bee Movie</ref> also featured a joke reference to a <ref target="/wiki/Parody" title="Parody">parody</ref> company of Enron called "Honron" (a play on the words honey and Enron). The 2017 book Bittersweet Symphony by Rebecca McNutt featured main character Bailey Kane discussing Enron while remarking, "in devastation there is opportunity, you know." The book also mentions in passing that deceased Enron executive <ref target="/wiki/J._Clifford_Baxter" title="J. Clifford Baxter">J. Clifford Baxter</ref> "tried to complain, he tried to live with it, he tried to do the right thing but nobody heard him…" The 2003 documentary <ref target="/wiki/The_Corporation_(2003_film)" title="The Corporation (2003 film)">The Corporation (2003 film)</ref> made frequent references to Enron post-bankruptcy, calling the company a "bad apple." Season 1, episode #20 of the <ref target="/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</ref> crime drama television series <ref target="/wiki/Cold_Case" title="Cold Case">Cold Case</ref> features a main character briefly mentioning that another character, Randy Price, is wanted by the <ref target="/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission" title="U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</ref> for an "Enron-type scandal."</p>

<h2>Insider trading scandal[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=27" title="Edit section: Insider trading scandal">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Peak and decline of stock price[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=28" title="Edit section: Peak and decline of stock price">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>During August 2000, Enron's stock price attained its greatest value of $90.56.<ref target="#cite_note-mclean-25">[25]</ref> At this time Enron executives, who possessed inside information on the hidden losses, began to sell their stock. At the same time, the general public and Enron's investors were told to buy the stock. Executives told the investors that the stock would continue to increase until it attained possibly the $130 to $140 range, while secretly unloading their shares.</p>
<p>As executives sold their shares, the price began to decrease. Investors were told to continue buying stock or hold steady if they already owned Enron because the stock price would rebound in the near future. Kenneth Lay's strategy for responding to Enron's continuing problems was his demeanor. As he did many times, Lay would issue a statement or make an appearance to calm investors and assure them that Enron was doing well.<ref target="#cite_note-Enron-44">[44]</ref> In February 2001 an article by <ref target="/wiki/Bethany_McLean" title="Bethany McLean">Bethany McLean</ref> appeared in <ref target="/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)" title="Fortune (magazine)">Fortune</ref> magazine questioning whether Enron stock was overvalued.<ref target="#cite_note-45">[45]</ref></p>
<p>By August 15, 2001, Enron's stock price had decreased to $42. Many of the investors still trusted Lay and believed that Enron would rule the market.<ref target="#cite_note-46">[46]</ref> They continued to buy or retain their stock as the equity value decreased. As October ended, the stock had decreased to $15. Many considered this a great opportunity to buy Enron stock because of what Lay had been telling them in the media.<ref target="#cite_note-Enron-44">[44]</ref></p>
<p>Lay was accused of selling more than $70 million worth of stock at this time, which he used to repay cash advances on lines of credit. He sold another $29 million worth of stock in the open market.<ref target="#cite_note-47">[47]</ref> Also, Lay's wife, Linda, was accused of selling 500,000 shares of Enron stock totaling $1.2 million on November 28, 2001. The money earned from this sale did not go to the family but rather to charitable organizations, which had already received pledges of contributions from the foundation.<ref target="#cite_note-48">[48]</ref> Records show that Mrs. Lay made the sale order sometime between 10:00 and 10:20 am. News of Enron's problems, including the millions of dollars in losses they hid, became public about 10:30 that morning, and the stock price soon decreased to less than one dollar.</p>
<p>Former Enron executive Paula Rieker was charged with criminal insider trading and sentenced to two years probation. Rieker obtained 18,380 Enron shares for $15.51 a share. She sold that stock for $49.77 a share during July 2001, a week before the public was told what she already knew about the $102 million loss.<ref target="#cite_note-49">[49]</ref> In 2002, after the tumultuous fall of Enron's external auditor, and management consultant, Andersen LLP, former Andersen Director, John M. Cunningham coined the phrase, "We have all been Enroned."</p>
<p>The fallout resulted in both Lay and Skilling being convicted of conspiracy, fraud, and insider trading. Lay died before sentencing, Skilling got 24 years and 4 months and a $45 million penalty (later reduced). Fastow was sentenced to six years of jail time, and Lou Pai settled out of court for $31.5 million.<ref target="#cite_note-50">[50]</ref></p>

<p>During October 2000, <ref target="/wiki/Daniel_Scotto" title="Daniel Scotto">Daniel Scotto</ref>, the most renowned utility analyst on <ref target="/wiki/Wall_Street" title="Wall Street">Wall Street</ref>, suspended his ratings on all energy companies conducting business in California because of the possibility that the companies would not receive full and adequate compensation for the deferred energy accounts used as the basis for the California Deregulation Plan enacted during the late 1990s.<ref target="#cite_note-51">[51]</ref> Five months later, <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pacific_Gas_%26_Electric" title="Pacific Gas & Electric">Pacific Gas & Electric</ref> (PG&E) was forced into bankruptcy. Republican Senator <ref target="/wiki/Phil_Gramm" title="Phil Gramm">Phil Gramm</ref>, husband of Enron Board member Wendy Gramm and also the second largest recipient of <ref target="/wiki/Political_campaign" title="Political campaign">campaign</ref> contributions from Enron,<ref target="#cite_note-52">[52]</ref> succeeded in legislating California's energy commodity trading deregulation. Despite warnings from prominent consumer groups which stated that this law would give energy traders too much influence over energy commodity prices, the legislation was passed during December 2000.</p>
<p>As the periodical <ref target="/wiki/Public_Citizen" title="Public Citizen">Public Citizen</ref> reported, "Because of Enron's new, unregulated power auction, the company's 'Wholesale Services' revenues quadrupled—- from $12 billion in the first quarter of 2000 to $48.4 billion in the first quarter of 2001."<ref target="#cite_note-53">[53]</ref></p>
<p>After passage of the deregulation law, California had a total of 38 Stage 3 <ref target="/wiki/Rolling_blackout" title="Rolling blackout">rolling blackouts</ref> declared, until federal regulators intervened during June 2001.<ref target="#cite_note-54">[54]</ref> These blackouts occurred as a result of a poorly designed market system that was manipulated by traders and marketers, as well as from poor state management and regulatory oversight. Subsequently, Enron traders were revealed as intentionally encouraging the removal of power from the market during California's energy crisis by encouraging suppliers to shut down plants to perform unnecessary maintenance, as documented in recordings made at the time.<ref target="#cite_note-55">[55]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-56">[56]</ref> These acts contributed to the need for rolling blackouts, which adversely affected many businesses dependent upon a reliable supply of electricity, and inconvenienced a large number of retail customers. This scattered supply increased the price, and Enron traders were thus able to sell power at premium prices, sometimes up to a factor of 20x its normal peak value.</p>

<h3>EnronOnline[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=38" title="Edit section: EnronOnline">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Enron opened EnronOnline, an <ref target="/wiki/Electronic_trading_platform" title="Electronic trading platform">electronic trading platform</ref> for energy commodities, on November 29, 1999.<ref target="#cite_note-Kolb239-57">[57]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-58">[58]</ref> Conceptualized by the company's European Gas Trading team, it was the first web-based transaction system that allowed buyers and sellers to buy, sell, and trade commodity products globally. It allowed users to do business only with Enron. The site allowed Enron to transact with participants in the global energy markets. The main commodities offered on EnronOnline were natural gas and electricity, although there were 500 other products including <ref target="/wiki/Credit_derivative" title="Credit derivative">credit derivatives</ref>, bankruptcy swaps, pulp, gas, plastics, paper, steel, metals, <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Freight" title="Freight">freight</ref>, and TV commercial time. At its maximum, more than $6 billion worth of commodities were transacted by means of EnronOnline every day.</p>
<p>After Enron's bankruptcy in late 2001, EnronOnline was sold to the Swiss financial giant <ref target="/wiki/UBS" title="UBS">UBS</ref>. Within a year, UBS abandoned its efforts to relaunch the division, and closed it in November 2002.<ref target="#cite_note-Kolb239-57">[57]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-59">[59]</ref></p>

<h3>Enron International[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=39" title="Edit section: Enron International">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Enron International (EI) was Enron's wholesale asset development and asset management business. Its primary emphasis was developing and building natural gas power plants outside North America. Enron Engineering and Construction Company (EECC) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron International, and built almost all of Enron International's power plants. Unlike other business units of Enron, Enron International had a strong cash flow on bankruptcy filing.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>] Enron International consisted of all of Enron's foreign power projects, including ones in Europe.</p>
<p>The company's <ref target="/wiki/Teesside" title="Teesside">Teesside</ref> plant was one of the largest gas-fired power stations in the world, built and operated by Enron from 1989, and produced 3 percent of the <ref target="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</ref>'s energy needs.<ref target="#cite_note-60">[60]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-Electricity_Game_2012-61">[61]</ref> Enron owned half of the plant's <ref target="/wiki/Equity_(finance)" title="Equity (finance)">equity</ref>, with the remaining 50 per cent split between four regional electricity companies.<ref target="#cite_note-Electricity_Game_2012-61">[61]</ref></p>

<h4>Management[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=40" title="Edit section: Management">edit</ref>]</h4>
<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rebecca_Mark" title="Rebecca Mark">Rebecca Mark</ref> was the CEO of Enron International until she resigned to manage Enron's newly acquired water business, <ref target="/wiki/Azurix" title="Azurix">Azurix</ref>, during 1997. Mark had a major role in the development of the Dabhol project in India, Enron's largest international endeavor.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>]

<h4>Projects[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=41" title="Edit section: Projects">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>Enron International constructed power plants and pipelines across the globe. Some are presently still operating, including the massive Teesside plant in England. Others, like a barge-mounted plant off Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic, cost Enron money by lawsuits and investment losses.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>] Puerto Plata was a barge-mounted power plant next to the hotel Hotelero del Atlantico. When the plant was activated, winds blew soot from the plant onto the hotel guests' meals, blackening their food. The winds also blew garbage from nearby slums into the plant's water-intake system. For some time the only solution was to hire men who would row out and push the garbage away with their paddles.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>] Through mid-2000 the company collected a paltry $3.5 million from a $95 million investment.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>] Enron also had other investment projects in Europe, South America, Argentina, <ref target="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</ref>, Bolivia, <ref target="/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</ref>, Mexico, <ref target="/wiki/Jamaica" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</ref>, Venezuela, and across the <ref target="/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</ref>.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>]</p>

<h4>India[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=42" title="Edit section: India">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>Around 1992 <ref target="/wiki/India" title="India">Indian</ref> experts came to the United States to find energy investors to help with India's energy shortage problems.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>] During December 1993, Enron finalized a 20-year power-purchase contract with the <ref target="/wiki/Maharashtra_State_Electricity_Board" title="Maharashtra State Electricity Board">Maharashtra State Electricity Board</ref>.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>] The contract allowed Enron to construct a massive 2,015 megawatt power plant on a remote volcanic bluff 100 miles (160 km) south of Mumbai. Construction would be completed in two phases, and Enron would form the <ref target="/wiki/Dabhol_Power_Company" title="Dabhol Power Company">Dabhol Power Company</ref> to help manage the plant. The power project was the first step in a $20 billion scheme to help rebuild and stabilize India's power grid. Enron, <ref target="/wiki/General_Electric" title="General Electric">GE</ref> (which was selling turbines to the project), and <ref target="/wiki/Bechtel" title="Bechtel">Bechtel</ref> (which was actually constructing the plant), each contributed 10% <ref target="/wiki/Equity_(finance)" title="Equity (finance)">equity</ref>.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>]</p>
<p>During 1996, when India's Congress Party was no longer in power, the Indian government assessed the project as being excessively expensive and refused to pay for the plant and stopped construction.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>] The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the local state-owned utility, was required by contract to continue to pay Enron plant maintenance charges, even if no power was purchased from the plant. The MSEB determined that it could not afford to purchase the power (at Rs. 8 per unit kWh) charged by Enron. The plant operator was unable to find alternate customers for Dabhol power due to the absence of a free market in the regulated structure of utilities in India.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>] From 1996 until Enron's bankruptcy during 2001 the company tried to revive the project and revive interest in India's need for the power plant without success.</p>

<h4>Project summer[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Enron&action=edit&section=43" title="Edit section: Project summer">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>During the summer of 2001, Enron made an attempt to sell a number of Enron International's assets, many of which were not sold. The public and media believed it was unknown why Enron wanted to sell these assets, suspecting it was because Enron was in need of cash.<ref target="#cite_note-62">[62]</ref> Employees who worked with company assets were told in 2000 <ref target="#cite_note-63">[63]</ref> that Jeff Skilling believed that business assets were an outdated means of company worth, and instead he wanted to build a company based on "intellectual assets".</p>
