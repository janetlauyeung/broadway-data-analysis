<h2>Background[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Dancing_at_Lughnasa&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Background">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>This play is loosely based on the lives of Friel's mother and aunts who lived in <ref target="/wiki/Glenties" title="Glenties">Glenties</ref>, on the west coast of Donegal. Set in the summer of 1936, the play depicts the late summer days when love briefly seems possible for five of the Mundy sisters (Maggie, Chris, Agnes, Rose, and Kate) and the family welcomes home the frail elder brother, Jack, who has returned from a life as a missionary in Africa. However, as the summer ends, the family foresees the sadness and economic privations under which they will suffer as all hopes fade.</p>
<p>The play takes place in early August, around the festival of <ref target="/wiki/Lughnasadh" title="Lughnasadh">Lughnasadh</ref>, the <ref target="/wiki/Celts" title="Celts">Celtic</ref> harvest festival. The play describes a bitter harvest for the Mundy sisters, a time of reaping what has been sown.</p>

<h2>Plot[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Dancing_at_Lughnasa&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Plot">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The five Mundy sisters (Kate, Maggie, Agnes, Rosie, and Christina), all unmarried, live in a cottage outside of Ballybeg. The oldest, Kate, is a <ref target="/wiki/School" title="School">school</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Teacher" title="Teacher">teacher</ref>, the only one with a well-paid job. Agnes and Rose <ref target="/wiki/Knitting" title="Knitting">knit</ref> gloves to be sold in town, thereby earning a little extra money for the household. They also help Maggie to keep house. Maggie and Christina (Michael's mother) have no income at all. Michael is seven years old and plays in and around the cottage.</p>
<p>All the drama takes place in the sisters' cottage or in the yard just outside, with events from town and beyond being reported either as they happen or as reminiscence.</p>
<p>Recently returned home after 25 years is their brother Jack, a priest who has lived as a <ref target="/wiki/Missionary" title="Missionary">missionary</ref> in a <ref target="/wiki/Leper_colony" title="Leper colony">leper colony</ref> in a remote village called Ryanga in <ref target="/wiki/Uganda" title="Uganda">Uganda</ref>. He is suffering from <ref target="/wiki/Malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</ref> and has trouble remembering many things, including the sisters' names and his English vocabulary. It becomes clear that he has "<ref class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/go_native" title="wikt:go native">gone native</ref>" and abandoned much of his <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catholicism" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</ref> during his time there. This may be the real reason he has been sent home.</p>
<p>Gerry, Michael's father, is <ref target="/wiki/Welsh_people" title="Welsh people">Welsh</ref>. He is a charming yet unreliable man, always <ref target="/wiki/Clown" title="Clown">clowning</ref>. He is a <ref target="/wiki/Vendor" title="Vendor">travelling salesman</ref> who sells <ref target="/wiki/Phonograph" title="Phonograph">gramophones</ref>. He visits rarely and always unannounced. A radio nicknamed "<ref target="/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi" title="Guglielmo Marconi">Marconi</ref>", which works only intermittently, brings <ref target="/wiki/Ballroom_dance" title="Ballroom dance">1930s dance</ref> and traditional <ref target="/wiki/Irish_dance" title="Irish dance">Irish folk music</ref> into the home at rather random moments and then, equally randomly, ceases to play. This leads the women into sudden outbursts of wild dancing.</p>
<p>The poverty and financial insecurity of the sisters is a constant theme. So are their unfulfilled lives: none of the sisters has married, although it is clear that they have had suitors whom they fondly remember.</p>
<p>There is a tension between the strict and proper behaviour demanded by the <ref target="/wiki/Catholic_Church" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</ref>, voiced most stridently by the upright Kate, and the unbridled emotional <ref target="/wiki/Paganism" title="Paganism">paganism</ref> of the local people in the "back hills" of Donegal and in the tribal people of Uganda.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that Gerry is serious this time about his marriage proposal to Christina. On this visit, he says he is going to join the <ref target="/wiki/International_Brigades" title="International Brigades">International brigade</ref> to fight in the <ref target="/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</ref>, not from any ideological commitment but because he wants adventure. There is a similar tension here between the "godless" forces he wants to join and the forces of <ref target="/wiki/Francisco_Franco" title="Francisco Franco">Franco</ref> against which he will be fighting, which are supported by the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>The opening of a <ref target="/wiki/Knitted_fabric" title="Knitted fabric">knitwear</ref> factory in the village has killed off the hand-knitted glove <ref target="/wiki/Putting-out_system#Cottage_industry" title="Putting-out system">cottage industry</ref> that has been the livelihood of Agnes and Rose. The village priest has told Kate that there are insufficient pupils at the school for her to continue in her post in the coming school year in September. She suspects that the real reason is her brother Jack, whose <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heretic" title="Heretic">heretical</ref> views have become known to the Church and have tainted her by association.</p>
<p>There is a sense that the close home life the women/girls have known since childhood is about to be torn apart. The narrator, the adult Michael, tells us this is indeed what happens.</p>

<h2>Characters[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Dancing_at_Lughnasa&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Kate Mundy</p>
<p>Kate is the eldest of the Mundy sisters and behaves as a Mother figure as a result. As a schoolteacher, she is the only wage-earner in the house, but her reputation as 'The Gander' in the schoolroom is seen to extend into the household. She is a fiercely devout Catholic, indicated by her distaste for the pagan practices at Lughnasa and Jack's loss of faith. However, her sensitivity is evident throughout the play and through the narratives provided by Michael, who claims she was "inconsolable" when Father Jack died.</p>
<p>Maggie Mundy</p>
<p>In place of a career, Maggie acts as the chief family homemaker. Throughout the play she is revealed as serving a deeper purpose as the "joker" of the family, defusing tensions as they arise. She cheekily challenges Kate's authority by calling her "Kitty", whilst being her confidant at the same time. Maggie is seen to have dreams of her own when she learns of her best friend's success. Her sudden quiet contemplation in her monologue is deeply contrasted with her usual fun-loving way of speaking.</p>
<p>Christina Mundy</p>
<p>At 26 years old, Chris is the youngest of the Mundy sisters, and, like Maggie, has no paid job. Gerry Evans fathered her son, Michael, seven years ago and is seen as walking in and out of their lives as he chooses. As a result, Chris fluctuates between falling into a deep depression when he leaves, yet being renewed with optimism that his next visit will be a permanent stay. Her lack of income can lead Chris to be defensive on the upbringing of her son, shown when Kate buys Michael a new spinning top at the beginning of the play.</p>
<p>Rose Mundy</p>
<p>Rose is 32, but behaves much younger than her years, due to a <ref target="/wiki/Developmental_disability" title="Developmental disability">developmental disability</ref>. This condition makes her particularly vulnerable to an unseen character, Danny Bradley, a married man, whom Rose believes is in love with her. However, her sisters believe that Bradley is exploiting Rose's simple nature for his own gain. She is particularly close to her older sister, Agnes, with whom she knits gloves to sell in the town. We learn through Michael's narrative that, after leaving home with Agnes, Rose eventually dies in a hospice for the destitute in <ref target="/wiki/Southwark" title="Southwark">Southwark</ref>, London, in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Agnes Mundy</p>
<p>Agnes is quiet and contemplative, knitting gloves with Rose whilst also helping to keep the house in order, along with Maggie. She appears to be silently infatuated with Gerry and is quick to leap to his defence. However, Michael's narratives reveal Agnes' future to be bleak. Her knitting fails to support her when the knitware factory opens. Due to her sense of parental regard for Rose, she emigrates with her to London, breaking off all contact with the family, and dies in dire circumstances in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Michael Evans (main character)</p>
<p>Michael does not appear onstage as a child, but his presence is alluded to by the other characters, while the adult Michael speaks his lines from the side of the stage. As a child, Michael is seen as being surrounded by love, since all five of the sisters dote on him. Michael also acts as a narrator, not only dictating the action as it goes on, but revealing the futures of the other characters in the play.</p>
<p>Gerry Evans</p>
<p>Gerry is initially portrayed as an intensely negative character, particularly by Kate, for having left Chris after fathering her illegitimate son, Michael. However, upon his first appearance in the play, Gerry is shown to be charming and genuinely affectionate towards Chris. His current job as a gramophone salesman (like his former job as a ballroom dancing instructor) represents his freedom, in sharp contrast to the stagnant lives of the Mundy sisters. This is made all the more obvious by the fact that he is leaving Ireland to join the <ref target="/wiki/International_Brigades" title="International Brigades">International Brigade</ref> and fight in the <ref target="/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</ref>, something that is further disapproved of by Kate. Through Michael's narration, we learn that Gerry is later left with a limp after falling off a motorbike in <ref target="/wiki/Barcelona" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</ref>. As well as having romantic feelings for Chris, Gerry seems particularly inclined towards Agnes, although the true state of their relationship remains in doubt. We learn later that he secretly has another family back in <ref target="/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</ref>, and that all his proposals of marriage to Christina have been false. Adult narrator Michael reveals that, after Gerry's death in the 1950s, he had been contacted by a half brother in South Wales, who revealed that Gerry had had a wife and several sons there at the time depicted in the drama.</p>
<p>Father Jack</p>
<p>Jack is in his late fifties. He had left home as a young man to work as a missionary in a leper colony in Uganda. Beyond this, he had been a Catholic chaplain in the British Army in East Africa during World War I. He is well respected in Donegal for his missionary work in a leper colony. However, his sudden return to Ballybeg for undisclosed reasons has paved the way for great changes. He has difficulty with his memory, often forgetting the names of his sisters or confusing them with his former house boy Okawa, with whom we are told he was very close. Jack professes a broad admiration for the pagan beliefs of the native people of Africa, and appears to have lost his Catholic faith, which may be the true reason his superiors have sent him back. This is a great worry for Kate, who is concerned about the family's reputation. Jack refers to Michael as a love child rather than an illegitimate child and says they are common and accepted among the people of Uganda.</p>
<p>In a scene near the close of the play he swaps his British colonial tricorn hat, a gift from a British governor, for a lesser hat worn by Gerry. Jack turns the swap into a non-catholic ceremony as well as referring to Uganda as his home. It is Gerry who is now to go abroad seeking adventure just as Jack settles back into his home country.</p>
<p>Father Jack recovers from his malaria and confusion, but Michael as narrator tells us that he died of a heart attack soon after the events portrayed in the play.</p>
