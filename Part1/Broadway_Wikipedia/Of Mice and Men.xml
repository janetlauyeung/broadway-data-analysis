<head>Plot</head>
<p>Two migrant field workers in California on their plantation during the Great Depression—George Milton, an intelligent but uneducated man, and Lennie Small, a bulky, strong man but <ref target="/wiki/Developmental_disability" title="Developmental disability">mentally disabled</ref>—are in <ref target="/wiki/Soledad,_California" title="Soledad, California">Soledad</ref> on their way to another part of California. They hope to one day attain the dream of settling down on their own piece of land. Lennie's part of the dream is merely to tend and pet <ref target="/wiki/Rabbit" title="Rabbit">rabbits</ref> on the farm, as he loves touching soft animals, although he always kills them. This dream is one of Lennie's favorite stories, which George constantly retells. They had fled from <ref target="/wiki/Weed,_California" title="Weed, California">Weed</ref> after Lennie touched a young woman's dress and would not let go, leading to an accusation of <ref target="/wiki/Rape" title="Rape">rape</ref>. It soon becomes clear that the two are close and George is Lennie's protector, despite his antics.</p>
<p>After being hired at a farm, the pair are confronted by Curley—The Boss's small, aggressive son with a <ref target="/wiki/Napoleon_complex" title="Napoleon complex">Napoleon complex</ref> who dislikes larger men, and starts to target Lennie. Curley's flirtatious and provocative wife, to whom Lennie is instantly attracted, poses a problem as well. In contrast, the pair also meets Candy, an elderly ranch handyman with one hand and a loyal dog, and Slim, an intelligent and gentle <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Muleteer" title="Muleteer">jerkline-skinner</ref> whose dog has recently had a <ref target="/wiki/Litter_(animal)" title="Litter (animal)">litter</ref> of puppies. Slim gives a puppy to Lennie and Candy, whose loyal, accomplished sheep dog was <ref target="/wiki/Animal_euthanasia" title="Animal euthanasia">put down</ref> by fellow ranch-hand Carlson.</p>
<p>In spite of problems, their dream leaps towards reality when Candy offers to pitch in $350 with George and Lennie so that they can buy a farm at the end of the month, in return for permission to live with them. The trio are ecstatic, but their joy is overshadowed when Curley attacks Lennie, who defends himself by easily crushing Curley's fist while urged on by George.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, George feels more relaxed, to the extent that he even leaves Lennie behind on the ranch while he goes into town with the other ranch hands. Lennie wanders into the stable, and chats with Crooks, the bitter, yet educated stable buck, who is isolated from the other workers due to being black. Candy finds them and they discuss their plans for the farm with Crooks, who cannot resist asking them if he can hoe a garden patch on the farm albeit scorning its possibility. Curley's wife makes another appearance and flirts with the men, especially Lennie. However, her spiteful side is shown when she belittles them and threatens to have Crooks <ref target="/wiki/Lynching" title="Lynching">lynched</ref>.</p>
<p>The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy while stroking it. Curley's wife enters the barn and tries to speak to Lennie, admitting that she is lonely and how her dreams of becoming a movie star are crushed, revealing her personality. After finding out about Lennie's habit, she offers to let him stroke her hair, but panics and begins to scream when she feels his strength. Lennie becomes frightened, and unintentionally breaks her neck thereafter and runs away. When the other ranch hands find the corpse, George realizes that their dream is at an end. George hurries to find Lennie, hoping he will be at the meeting place they designated in case he got into trouble.</p>
<p>George meets Lennie at the place, their camping spot before they came to the ranch. The two sit together and George retells the beloved story of the dream, knowing it is something they will never share. He then <ref target="/wiki/Involuntary_euthanasia" title="Involuntary euthanasia">euthanizes</ref> Lennie by shooting him, because he sees it as an action in Lennie's best interest. Curley, Slim, and Carlson arrive seconds after. Only Slim realizes what happened, and consolingly leads him away. Curley and Carlson look on, unable to comprehend the subdued mood of the two men.</p>

<head>Characters</head>
<p>George Milton: A quick-witted man who is Lennie's guardian and best friend. His friendship with Lennie helps sustain his dream of a better future. He was bound in teasing Lennie since he was young. He is described by Steinbeck in the novel as "small and quick," every part of him being "defined," with small strong hands on slender arms. He has a dark face and "restless eyes" and "sharp, strong features" including a "thin, bony nose."</p>
<p>Lennie Small: A <ref target="/wiki/Developmental_disability" title="Developmental disability">mentally disabled</ref>, but gigantic and physically strong man who travels with George and is his constant companion.<ref target="#cite_note-nyt-parini-5">[5]</ref> He dreams of "living off the fatta' the lan'" and being able to tend to rabbits. His love for soft things conspires against him, mostly because he does not know his own strength, and eventually becomes his undoing. Steinbeck defines his appearance as George's "opposite," writing that he is a "huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes" and "wide, sloping shoulders." Lennie walks heavily, dragging his feet a little, "the way a bear drags his paws," adding that his arms do not swing at his sides, but hang loosely.</p>
<p>Candy: An aging ranch handyman, Candy lost his hand in an accident and worries about his future on the ranch. Fearing that his age is making him useless, he seizes on George’s description of the farm he and Lennie will have, offering his life’s savings if he can join George and Lennie in owning the land.</p>
<p>Slim: A "jerkline skinner," the main driver of a <ref target="/wiki/Mule" title="Mule">mule</ref> team and the "prince of the ranch". Slim is greatly respected by many of the characters and is the only character whom Curley treats with respect. His insight, intuition, kindness and natural authority draw the other ranch hands automatically towards him, and he is significantly the only character to fully understand the bond between George and Lennie.</p>
<p>Curley: The Boss' son, a young, pugnacious character, once a semi-professional boxer. He is described by others, with some irony, as "handy", partly because he likes to keep a glove filled with <ref target="/wiki/Vaseline" title="Vaseline">vaseline</ref> on his left hand. He is very jealous and protective of his wife and immediately develops a dislike toward Lennie. At one point, Curley loses his temper after he sees Lennie appear to laugh at him, and ends up with his hand horribly damaged after Lennie fights back against him.</p>
<p>Curley's wife: A young, pretty woman, who is mistrusted by her husband. The other characters refer to her only as "Curley's wife". Steinbeck explained that she is "not a person, she's a symbol. She has no function, except to be a foil – and a danger to Lennie."<ref target="#cite_note-nyt-parini-5">[5]</ref> Curley's wife's preoccupation with her own beauty eventually helps precipitate her death: She allows Lennie to stroke her hair as an apparently harmless indulgence, only for her to upset Lennie when she yells at him to stop him 'mussing it'. Lennie tries to stop her yelling and eventually, and accidentally, kills her by breaking her neck.</p>
<p>Crooks: Crooks, the black stable-hand, gets his name from his crooked back. Proud, bitter, and cynical, he is isolated from the other men because of the color of his skin. Despite himself, Crooks becomes fond of Lennie, and though he claims to have seen countless men following empty dreams of buying their own land, he asks Lennie if he can go with them and hoe in the garden.</p>
<p>Candy's dog: A blind dog who is described as "old", "stinky", and "crippled", and is killed by Carlson.</p>
<p>Carlson: A "thick bodied" ranch hand, he kills Candy's dog with little sympathy.</p>
<p>The Boss: Curley's father, the superintendent of the ranch. The ranch is owned by "a big land company" according to Candy.</p>
<p>Whit: A young ranch hand.</p>

Try to understand men, if you understand each other you will be kind to each other. Knowing a man well never leads to hate and nearly always leads to love. There are shorter means, many of them. There is writing promoting social change, writing punishing injustice, writing in celebration of heroism, but always that base theme. Try to understand each other.— <ref target="/wiki/John_Steinbeck" title="John Steinbeck">John Steinbeck</ref> in his 1938 journal entry<ref target="#cite_note-introshillinglaw-6">[6]</ref></p>

<p>Steinbeck emphasizes dreams throughout the book.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify">clarification needed</ref>] George aspires to independence, to be his own boss, to have a homestead, and, most important, to be "somebody". Lennie aspires to be with George on his independent homestead, and to quench his <ref target="/wiki/Fixation_(psychology)" title="Fixation (psychology)">fixation</ref> on soft objects. Candy aspires to reassert his responsibility lost with the death of his dog, and for security for his old age—on George's homestead. Crooks aspires to a small homestead where he can express self-respect, security, and most of all, acceptance. Curley's wife dreams to be an actress, to satisfy her desire for fame lost when she married Curley, and an end to her loneliness.</p>
<p>Loneliness is a significant factor in several characters' lives. Candy is lonely after his dog is gone. Curley's wife is lonely because her husband is not the friend she hoped for—she deals with her loneliness by flirting with the men on the ranch, which causes Curley to increase his abusiveness and jealousy. The companionship of George and Lennie is the result of loneliness. Crooks states the theme candidly as "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got anybody. Don't make any difference who the guy is, long's he's with you."<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> The author further reinforces this theme through subtle methods by situating the story near the town of <ref target="/wiki/Soledad,_California" title="Soledad, California">Soledad</ref>, which means "solitude" in Spanish.<ref target="#cite_note-cliffnotebook-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>Despite the need for companionship, Steinbeck emphasizes how loneliness is sustained through the barriers established from acting inhuman to one another. The loneliness of Curley's wife is upheld by Curley's jealousy, which causes all the ranch hands to avoid her. Crooks's barrier results from being barred from the bunkhouse by restraining him to the <ref target="/wiki/Stable" title="Stable">stable</ref>; his bitterness is partially broken, however, through Lennie's ignorance.</p>
<p>Steinbeck's characters are often powerless, due to intellectual, economic, and social circumstances. Lennie possesses the greatest physical strength of any character, which should therefore establish a sense of respect as he is employed as a ranch hand. However, his intellectual handicap undercuts this and results in his powerlessness. Economic powerlessness is established as many of the ranch hands are victims of the <ref target="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</ref>. As George, Candy and Crooks are positive, action- oriented characters, they wish to purchase a homestead, but because of the Depression, they are unable to generate enough money. Lennie is the only one who is basically unable to take care of himself, but the other characters would do this in the improved circumstances they seek. Since they cannot do so, the real danger of Lennie's mental handicap comes to the fore.</p>
<p>Regarding human interaction, evil of oppression and abuse is a theme that is illustrated through Curley and Curley's wife. Curley uses his aggressive nature and superior position in an attempt to take control of his father's farm. He constantly reprimands the farm hands and accuses some of fooling around with his wife. Curley's <ref target="/wiki/Napoleon_complex" title="Napoleon complex">Napoleon complex</ref> is evidenced by his threatening of the farm hands for minuscule incidents. Curley's wife, on the other hand, is not physically but verbally manipulative. She uses her sex appeal to gain some attention, flirting with the farm hands. According to the <ref target="/wiki/Penguin_Group" title="Penguin Group">Penguin</ref> Teacher's Guide for Of Mice and Men, Curley and Curley's wife represent evil in that both oppress and abuse the migrants in different ways.<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref></p>
<p>Fate is felt most heavily as the characters' aspirations are destroyed when George is unable to protect Lennie (who is a real danger). Steinbeck presents this as "something that happened" or as his friend coined for him "non-teleological thinking" or "is thinking", which postulates a non-judgmental point of view.<ref target="#cite_note-introshillinglaw-6">[6]</ref></p>

<head>Development</head>
<p>Of Mice and Men was Steinbeck's first attempt at writing in the form of novel-play termed a "play-novelette" by one critic. Structured in three acts of two chapters each, it is intended to be both a novella and a script for a play. It is only 30,000 words in length. Steinbeck wanted to write a novel that could be played from its lines, or a play that could be read like a novel.<ref target="#cite_note-BurningBright-10">[10]</ref></p>
<p>Steinbeck originally titled it Something That Happened (referring to the events of the book as "something that happened" because nobody can be really blamed for the tragedy that unfolds in the story). However, he changed the title after reading <ref target="/wiki/Robert_Burns" title="Robert Burns">Robert Burns</ref>'s poem <ref target="/wiki/To_a_Mouse" title="To a Mouse">To a Mouse</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-Shillinglaw-11">[11]</ref> Burns's poem tells of the regret the narrator feels for having destroyed the home of a mouse while plowing his field.<ref target="#cite_note-12">[12]</ref></p>
<p>Steinbeck wrote this book and <ref target="/wiki/The_Grapes_of_Wrath" title="The Grapes of Wrath">The Grapes of Wrath</ref> in what is now <ref target="/wiki/Monte_Sereno,_California" title="Monte Sereno, California">Monte Sereno, California</ref>. An early draft of Of Mice and Men was eaten by Steinbeck's dog, named Max.<ref target="#cite_note-FirstDrafts-13">[13]</ref></p>

<head>Reception</head>
<p>Attaining the greatest positive response of any of his works up to that time, Steinbeck's novella was chosen as a <ref target="/wiki/Book_of_the_Month_Club" title="Book of the Month Club">Book of the Month Club</ref> selection before it was published. Praise for the work came from many notable critics, including Maxine Garrard (Enquirer-Sun),<ref target="#cite_note-14">[14]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Christopher_Morley" title="Christopher Morley">Christopher Morley</ref>, and Harry Thornton Moore (New Republic).<ref target="#cite_note-15">[15]</ref> New York Times critic Ralph Thompson described the novella as a "grand little book, for all its ultimate melodrama."<ref target="#cite_note-ContemporaryReviews-16">[16]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-17">[17]</ref></p>
<p>The novella has been banned from various US public and school libraries or curricula for allegedly "promoting <ref target="/wiki/Euthanasia" title="Euthanasia">euthanasia</ref>", "condoning</p>
<p>racial slurs", being "anti-business", containing profanity, and generally containing "vulgar" and "offensive language".<ref target="#cite_note-18">[18]</ref> Many of the bans and </p>
<p>restrictions have been lifted and it remains required reading in many other American, Australian, Irish, British, New Zealand and Canadian </p>
<p>high schools. As a result of being a frequent target of censors, Of Mice and Men appears on the <ref target="/wiki/American_Library_Association" title="American Library Association">American Library Association</ref>'s list </p>
<p>of the Most Challenged Books of the 21st Century (number 4).<ref target="#cite_note-ChallengedBooks-19">[19]</ref> In the UK, it was listed at number 52 of the "nation's best loved novels" on the <ref target="/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</ref>'s 2003 survey <ref target="/wiki/The_Big_Read" title="The Big Read">The Big Read</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-20">[20]</ref> Of Mice and Men has been <ref target="/wiki/Book_censorship_in_the_United_States" title="Book censorship in the United States">challenged </ref> (proposed for censorship) 54 times since it was published in 1936.<ref target="#cite_note-21">[21]</ref> However, scholars </p>
<p>like Thomas Scarseth have fought to protect the book by citing its literary value. According to Scarseth "in true great literature the </p>
<p>pain of Life is transmuted into the beauty of Art",.<ref target="#cite_note-22">[22]</ref></p>
