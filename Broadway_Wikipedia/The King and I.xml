<p>The King and I is the fifth <ref target="/wiki/Musical_theatre" title="Musical theatre">musical</ref> by <ref target="/wiki/Rodgers_and_Hammerstein" title="Rodgers and Hammerstein">the team</ref> of composer <ref target="/wiki/Richard_Rodgers" title="Richard Rodgers">Richard Rodgers</ref> and dramatist <ref target="/wiki/Oscar_Hammerstein_II" title="Oscar Hammerstein II">Oscar Hammerstein II</ref>. It is based on <ref target="/wiki/Margaret_Landon" title="Margaret Landon">Margaret Landon</ref>'s novel, <ref target="/wiki/Anna_and_the_King_of_Siam_(novel)" title="Anna and the King of Siam (novel)">Anna and the King of Siam</ref> (1944), which is in turn derived from the memoirs of <ref target="/wiki/Anna_Leonowens" title="Anna Leonowens">Anna Leonowens</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Governess" title="Governess">governess</ref> to the children of <ref target="/wiki/Mongkut" title="Mongkut">King Mongkut</ref> of <ref target="/wiki/Thailand" title="Thailand">Siam</ref> in the early 1860s. The musical's plot relates the experiences of Anna, a British schoolteacher hired as part of the King's drive to modernize his country. The relationship between the King and Anna is marked by conflict through much of the piece, as well as by a love to which neither can admit. The musical premiered on March 29, 1951, at <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref>'s <ref target="/wiki/St._James_Theatre" title="St. James Theatre">St. James Theatre</ref>. It ran for nearly three years, making it the fourth longest-running Broadway musical in history at the time, and has had many tours and revivals.</p>
<p>In 1950, theatrical attorney <ref target="/wiki/Fanny_Holtzmann" title="Fanny Holtzmann">Fanny Holtzmann</ref> was looking for a part for her client, veteran leading lady <ref target="/wiki/Gertrude_Lawrence" title="Gertrude Lawrence">Gertrude Lawrence</ref>. Holtzmann realized that Landon's book would provide an ideal vehicle and contacted <ref target="/wiki/Rodgers_and_Hammerstein" title="Rodgers and Hammerstein">Rodgers and Hammerstein</ref>, who were initially reluctant but agreed to write the musical. The pair initially sought <ref target="/wiki/Rex_Harrison" title="Rex Harrison">Rex Harrison</ref> to play the supporting part of the King, a role he had played in <ref target="/wiki/Anna_and_the_King_of_Siam_(film)" title="Anna and the King of Siam (film)">the 1946 film</ref> made from Landon's book, but he was unavailable. They settled on the young actor and television director <ref target="/wiki/Yul_Brynner" title="Yul Brynner">Yul Brynner</ref>.</p>
<p>The musical was an immediate hit, winning <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Award" title="Tony Award">Tony Awards</ref> for <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Musical" title="Tony Award for Best Musical">Best Musical</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Actress_in_a_Musical" title="Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical">Best Actress</ref> (for Lawrence) and <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Featured_Actor_in_a_Musical" title="Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical">Best Featured Actor</ref> (for Brynner). Lawrence died unexpectedly of cancer a year and a half after the opening, and the role of Anna was played by several actresses during the remainder of the Broadway run of 1,246 performances. A hit London run and U.S. national tour followed, together with <ref target="/wiki/The_King_and_I_(1956_film)" title="The King and I (1956 film)">a 1956 film</ref> for which Brynner won an <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</ref>, and the musical was recorded several times. In later revivals, Brynner came to dominate his role and the musical, starring in a four-year national tour culminating in a 1985 Broadway run shortly before his death.</p>
<ref target="/wiki/Christopher_Renshaw" title="Christopher Renshaw">Christopher Renshaw</ref> directed major revivals on Broadway (1996), winning the <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Revival_of_a_Musical" title="Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical">Tony Award for Best Revival</ref>, and in the West End (2000). A 2015 Broadway revival won another Tony for Best Revival. Both professional and amateur revivals of The King and I continue to be staged regularly throughout the English-speaking world.

A wife is seated at left.
<ref target="/wiki/Mongkut" title="Mongkut">Mongkut</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Monarchy_of_Thailand" title="Monarchy of Thailand">King of Siam</ref>, was about 57 years old in 1861. He had lived half his life as a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Buddhist_monk" title="Buddhist monk">Buddhist monk</ref>, was an able scholar, and founded a new order of Buddhism and a temple in Bangkok (paid for by his half-brother, King <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nangklao" title="Nangklao">Nangklao</ref>). Through his decades of devotion, Mongkut acquired an ascetic lifestyle and a firm grasp of Western languages. When Nangklao died in 1850, Mongkut became king. At that time, various European countries were striving for dominance, and American traders sought greater influence in Southeast Asia. He ultimately succeeded in keeping Siam an independent nation, partly by familiarizing his heirs and harem with Western ways.<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref>
<p>In 1861, Mongkut wrote to his Singapore agent, <ref target="/wiki/Tan_Kim_Ching" title="Tan Kim Ching">Tan Kim Ching</ref>, asking him to find a British lady to be governess to the royal children. At the time, the British community in Singapore was small, and the choice fell on a recent arrival there, <ref target="/wiki/Anna_Leonowens" title="Anna Leonowens">Anna Leonowens</ref> (1831–1915), who was running a small nursery school in the colony.<ref target="#cite_note-Morgan86-2">[2]</ref> Leonowens was the <ref target="/wiki/Anglo-Indian" title="Anglo-Indian">Anglo-Indian</ref> daughter of an <ref target="/wiki/Bombay_Army" title="Bombay Army">Indian Army</ref> soldier and the widow of Thomas Owens, a clerk and hotel keeper. She had arrived in Singapore two years previously, claiming to be the genteel widow of an officer and explaining her dark complexion by stating that she was <ref target="/wiki/Welsh_people" title="Welsh people">Welsh</ref> by birth. Her deception was not detected until long after her death, and had still not come to light when The King and I was written.<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref></p>

<p>Upon receiving the King's invitation, Leonowens sent her daughter, Avis, to school in England, to give Avis the social advantage of a prestigious British education, and traveled to <ref target="/wiki/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</ref> with her five-year-old son, <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Louis_Leonowens" title="Louis Leonowens">Louis</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-Morgan86-2">[2]</ref> King Mongkut had sought a Briton to teach his children and wives after trying local <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Missionaries" title="Missionaries">missionaries</ref>, who used the opportunity to proselytize. Leonowens initially asked for $150 in <ref target="/wiki/Straits_dollar" title="Straits dollar">Singapore currency</ref> per month. Her additional request, to live in or near the missionary community to ensure she was not deprived of Western company, aroused suspicion in Mongkut, who cautioned in a letter, "we need not have teacher of Christianity as they are abundant here".<ref target="#cite_note-Morgan88-4">[4]</ref> King Mongkut and Leonowens came to an agreement: $100 per month and a residence near the royal palace. At a time when most transport in Bangkok was by boat, Mongkut did not wish to have to arrange for the teacher to get to work every day.<ref target="#cite_note-Morgan88-4">[4]</ref> Leonowens and Louis temporarily lived as guests of Mongkut's prime minister, and after the first house offered was found to be unsuitable, the family moved into a brick residence (wooden structures decayed quickly in Bangkok's climate) within walking distance of the palace.<ref target="#cite_note-Morgan88-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>In 1867, Leonowens took a six-month leave of absence to visit her daughter Avis in England, intending to deposit Louis at a school in Ireland and return to Siam with Avis.<ref target="#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> However, due to unexpected delays and opportunities for further travel, Leonowens was still abroad in late 1868, when Mongkut fell ill and died. Leonowens did not return to Siam, although she continued to correspond with her former pupil, the new king <ref target="/wiki/Chulalongkorn" title="Chulalongkorn">Chulalongkorn</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-6">[6]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>

<h2>Creation[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_King_and_I&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Creation">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>In 1950, British actress <ref target="/wiki/Gertrude_Lawrence" title="Gertrude Lawrence">Gertrude Lawrence</ref>'s business manager and attorney, <ref target="/wiki/Fanny_Holtzmann" title="Fanny Holtzmann">Fanny Holtzmann</ref>, was looking for a new vehicle for her client when the 1944 <ref target="/wiki/Margaret_Landon" title="Margaret Landon">Margaret Landon</ref> novel <ref target="/wiki/Anna_and_the_King_of_Siam_(novel)" title="Anna and the King of Siam (novel)">Anna and the King of Siam</ref> (a fictionalized version of Leonowens' experiences) was sent to her by Landon's <ref target="/wiki/Talent_agent" title="Talent agent">agent</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-Nolan199-8">[8]</ref> According to Rodgers biographer <ref target="/wiki/Meryle_Secrest" title="Meryle Secrest">Meryle Secrest</ref>, Holtzmann was worried that Lawrence's career was fading.<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> The 51-year-old actress had appeared only in plays, not in musicals, since <ref target="/wiki/Lady_in_the_Dark" title="Lady in the Dark">Lady in the Dark</ref> closed in 1943.<ref target="#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> Holtzmann agreed that a musical based on Anna and the King of Siam would be ideal for her client,<ref target="#cite_note-Nolan199-8">[8]</ref> who purchased the rights to adapt the novel for the stage.<ref target="#cite_note-Hischak148-11">[11]</ref></p>
<p>Holtzmann initially wanted <ref target="/wiki/Cole_Porter" title="Cole Porter">Cole Porter</ref> to write the <ref target="/wiki/Theatre_music" title="Theatre music">score</ref>, but he declined. She was going to approach <ref target="/wiki/No%C3%ABl_Coward" title="Noël Coward">Noël Coward</ref> next, but happened to meet <ref target="/wiki/Dorothy_Hammerstein" title="Dorothy Hammerstein">Dorothy Hammerstein</ref> (Oscar's wife) in Manhattan. Holtzmann told Dorothy Hammerstein that she wanted <ref target="/wiki/Rodgers_and_Hammerstein" title="Rodgers and Hammerstein">Rodgers and Hammerstein</ref> to create a show for Lawrence, and asked her to see that her husband read a book that Holtzmann would send over. In fact, both Dorothy Rodgers and Dorothy Hammerstein had read the novel in 1944 and had urged their husbands to consider it as a possible subject for a musical.<ref target="#cite_note-Nolan199-8">[8]</ref> Dorothy Hammerstein had known Gertrude Lawrence since 1925, when they had both appeared in <ref target="/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Charlot" title="André Charlot">André Charlot</ref>'s London Revue of 1924 on Broadway and on tour in North America.<ref target="#cite_note-12">[12]</ref></p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:R_and_H.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:R_and_H.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>Rodgers (left) and Hammerstein
<p>Rodgers and Hammerstein had disliked Landon's novel as a basis for a musical when it was published, and their views still held. It consists of <ref target="/wiki/Vignette_(literature)" title="Vignette (literature)">vignettes</ref> of life at the Siamese court, interspersed with descriptions of historical events unconnected with each other, except that the King creates most of the difficulties in the episodes, and Anna tries to resolve them.<ref target="#cite_note-Nolan310-13">[13]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-14">[14]</ref> Rodgers and Hammerstein could see no coherent story from which a musical could be made<ref target="#cite_note-Nolan310-13">[13]</ref> until they saw the <ref target="/wiki/Anna_and_the_King_of_Siam_(film)" title="Anna and the King of Siam (film)">1946 film adaptation</ref>, starring <ref target="/wiki/Irene_Dunne" title="Irene Dunne">Irene Dunne</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Rex_Harrison" title="Rex Harrison">Rex Harrison</ref>, and how the <ref target="/wiki/Screenplay" title="Screenplay">screenplay</ref> united the episodes in the novel.<ref target="#cite_note-Nolan310-13">[13]</ref> Rodgers and Hammerstein were also concerned about writing a star vehicle. They had preferred to make stars rather than hire them, and engaging the legendary Gertrude Lawrence would be expensive. Lawrence's voice was also a worry: her limited vocal range was diminishing with the years, while her tendency to sing flat was increasing. Lawrence's temperament was another concern: though she could not sing like one, the star was known to be capable of <ref target="/wiki/Diva" title="Diva">diva</ref>-like behavior.<ref target="#cite_note-15">[15]</ref> In spite of this, they admired her acting – what Hammerstein called her "magic light", a compelling presence on stage – and agreed to write the show.<ref target="#cite_note-16">[16]</ref> For her part, Lawrence committed to remaining in the show until June 1, 1953, and waived the star's usual veto rights over cast and director, leaving control in the hands of the two authors.<ref target="#cite_note-17">[17]</ref></p>
<p>Hammerstein found his "door in" to the play in Landon's account of a slave in Siam writing about <ref target="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</ref>. This would eventually become the narrated dance, "<ref target="/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin" title="Uncle Tom's Cabin">The Small House of Uncle Thomas</ref>". Since a frank expression of romantic feelings between the King and Anna would be inappropriate in view of both parties' upbringing and prevailing social mores,<ref target="#cite_note-Bloom163-18">[18]</ref> Hammerstein wrote love scenes for a secondary couple, Tuptim, a junior wife of the King, and Lun Tha, a scholar. In the Landon work, the relationship is between Tuptim and a priest, and is not romantic. The musical's most radical change from the novel was to have the King die at the end of the musical.<ref target="#cite_note-19">[19]</ref> Also, since Lawrence was not primarily a singer, the secondary couple gave Rodgers a chance to write his usual "soaring" romantic melodies.<ref target="#cite_note-20">[20]</ref> In an interview for <ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref>, Hammerstein indicated that he wrote the first scene before leaving for London and the <ref target="/wiki/West_End_theatre" title="West End theatre">West End</ref> production of <ref target="/wiki/Carousel_(musical)" title="Carousel (musical)">Carousel</ref> in mid-1950; he wrote a second scene while in the British capital.<ref target="#cite_note-21">[21]</ref></p>
<p>The pair had to overcome the challenge of how to represent <ref target="/wiki/Thai_language" title="Thai language">Thai</ref> speech and music. Rodgers, who had experimented with Asian music in his short-lived 1928 musical with <ref target="/wiki/Lorenz_Hart" title="Lorenz Hart">Lorenz Hart</ref> titled Chee-chee,<ref target="#cite_note-Secrest311-22">[22]</ref> did not wish to use actual Thai music, which American audiences might not find accessible. Instead, he gave his music an exotic flavor, using <ref target="/wiki/Perfect_fifth#Bare_fifth,_open_fifth,_or_empty_fifth" title="Perfect fifth">open fifths</ref> and chords in unusual keys, in ways pleasant to Western ears.<ref target="#cite_note-MillerExotic-23">[23]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-Fordin293-24">[24]</ref> Hammerstein faced the problem of how to represent Thai speech; he and Rodgers chose to convey it by musical sounds, made by the orchestra. For the King's style of speech, Hammerstein developed an abrupt, emphatic way of talking, which was mostly free of articles, as are many East Asian languages. The forceful style reflected the King's personality and was maintained even when he sang, especially in his one solo, "A Puzzlement".<ref target="#cite_note-Fordin293-24">[24]</ref> Many of the King's lines, including his first utterance, "Who? Who? Who?", and much of the initial scene between him and Anna, are drawn from Landon's version. Nevertheless, the King is presented more sympathetically in the musical than in the novel or the 1946 film, as the musical omits the torture and burning at the stake of Lady Tuptim and her partner.<ref target="#cite_note-25">[25]</ref></p>
<p>With Rodgers laid up with back trouble, Hammerstein completed most of the musical's <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Book_(musical_theatre)" title="Book (musical theatre)">book</ref> before many songs were set to music.<ref target="#cite_note-26">[26]</ref> Early on, Hammerstein contacted set designer <ref target="/wiki/Jo_Mielziner" title="Jo Mielziner">Jo Mielziner</ref> and costume designer <ref target="/wiki/Irene_Sharaff" title="Irene Sharaff">Irene Sharaff</ref> and asked them to begin work in coordination with each other. Sharaff communicated with <ref target="/wiki/Jim_Thompson_(designer)" title="Jim Thompson (designer)">Jim Thompson</ref>, an American who had revived the Thai silk industry after World War II. Thompson sent Sharaff samples of silk cloth from Thailand and pictures of local dress from the mid-19th century.<ref target="#cite_note-27">[27]</ref> One such picture, of a Thai woman in western dress, inspired the song "Western People Funny", sung by the King's chief wife, Lady Thiang, while dressed in western garb.<ref target="#cite_note-Fordin296-28">[28]</ref></p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Jerome_Robbins_1951.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Jerome_Robbins_1951.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>Choreographer <ref target="/wiki/Jerome_Robbins" title="Jerome Robbins">Jerome Robbins</ref>
<p>Producer <ref target="/wiki/Leland_Hayward" title="Leland Hayward">Leland Hayward</ref>, who had worked with the duo on <ref target="/wiki/South_Pacific_(musical)" title="South Pacific (musical)">South Pacific</ref>, approached <ref target="/wiki/Jerome_Robbins" title="Jerome Robbins">Jerome Robbins</ref> to choreograph a ballet for "The Small House of Uncle Thomas". Robbins was very enthusiastic about the project and asked to choreograph the other musical numbers as well, although Rodgers and Hammerstein had originally planned little other dancing.

<p>The pair discussed having an Act 1 musical scene involving Anna and the King's wives. The lyrics for that scene proved to be very difficult for Hammerstein to write. He first thought that Anna would simply tell the wives something about her past, and wrote such lyrics as "I was dazzled by the splendor/Of Calcutta and Bombay" and "The celebrities were many/And the parties very gay/(I recall a curry dinner/And a certain Major Grey)."<ref target="#cite_note-Mordden144-31">[31]</ref> Eventually, Hammerstein decided to write about how Anna felt, a song which would not only explain her past and her motivation for traveling with her son to the court of Siam, but also serve to establish a bond with Tuptim and lay the groundwork for the conflict that devastates Anna's relationship with the King.<ref target="#cite_note-Bloom163-18">[18]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-Mordden144-31">[31]</ref> "Hello, Young Lovers", the resulting song, was the work of five exhausting weeks for Hammerstein.

Hammerstein considered the song his best work and was anxious to hear what Rodgers thought of it, but no comment came from Rodgers. Pride kept Hammerstein from asking. Finally, after four days, the two happened to be talking on the phone about other matters, and at the end of the conversation, Rodgers stated, very briefly, that the lyric was fine. <ref target="/wiki/Josh_Logan" title="Josh Logan">Josh Logan</ref>, who had worked closely with Hammerstein on South Pacific, listened to the usually unflappable writer pour out his unhappy feelings.

<p>Although the part of the King was only a supporting role to Lawrence's Anna, Hammerstein and Rodgers thought it essential that a well-known theatrical actor play it. The obvious choice was Rex Harrison, who had played the King in the movie, but he was booked, as was Noël Coward. <ref target="/wiki/Alfred_Drake" title="Alfred Drake">Alfred Drake</ref>, the original Curly in <ref target="/wiki/Oklahoma!" title="Oklahoma!">Oklahoma!</ref>, made contractual demands which were deemed too high. With time running short before rehearsals, finding an actor to play the King became a major concern. <ref target="/wiki/Mary_Martin" title="Mary Martin">Mary Martin</ref>, the original Nellie Forbush in South Pacific, suggested that her co-star in a 1946 musical set in China, <ref target="/wiki/Lute_Song_(musical)" title="Lute Song (musical)">Lute Song</ref>, try for the role.<ref target="#cite_note-33">[33]</ref> Rodgers recounted the audition of the Russian-American performer, <ref target="/wiki/Yul_Brynner" title="Yul Brynner">Yul Brynner</ref>:</p>

<p>Brynner termed Rodgers' account "very picturesque, but totally inaccurate". He recalled that as an established television director (in <ref target="/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</ref>'s Starlight Theatre, for example), he was reluctant to go back on the stage. His wife, his agent and Martin finally convinced him to read Hammerstein's working script, and once he did, he was fascinated by the character of the King and was eager to do the project.<ref target="#cite_note-35">[35]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-36">[36]</ref> In any case, Brynner's fierce, mercurial, dangerous, yet surprisingly sensitive King was an ideal foil for Lawrence's strong-willed, yet vulnerable Anna, and when the two finally came together in "<ref target="/wiki/Shall_We_Dance%3F_(1951_song)" title="Shall We Dance?

<p>Pre-rehearsal preparations began in late 1950. Hammerstein had wanted Logan to direct and co-write the book, as he had for South Pacific, but when Logan declined, Hammerstein decided to write the entire book himself. Instead of Logan, the duo hired as director <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/John_van_Druten" title="John van Druten">John van Druten</ref>, who had worked with Lawrence years earlier. The costume designer, Sharaff, wryly pointed the press to the incongruity of a Victorian British governess in the midst of an exotic court: "The first-act finale of The King and I will feature Miss Lawrence, Mr. Brynner, and a pink satin ball gown."<ref target="#cite_note-37">[37]</ref> Mielziner's set plan was the simplest of the four Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals he had worked on, with one main set (the throne room), a number of front-stage drops (for the ship and Anna's room, for example) and the entire stage cleared for "The Small House of Uncle Thomas".<ref target="#cite_note-38">[38]</ref></p>
<p>The show was budgeted at $250,000 (US$2,410,000 in 2018 dollars) making it the most expensive Rodgers and Hammerstein production to that point, and prompting some mockery that costs exceeded even their expensive flop <ref target="/wiki/Allegro_(musical)" title="Allegro (musical)">Allegro</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-39">[39]</ref> Investors included Hammerstein, Rodgers, Logan, Martin, <ref target="/wiki/Billy_Rose" title="Billy Rose">Billy Rose</ref> and Hayward.<ref target="#cite_note-Mordden190-40">[40]</ref> The children who were cast as the young princes and princesses came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, including Puerto Rican or Italian, though none were Thai.<ref target="#cite_note-41">[41]</ref> Johnny Stewart was the original Prince Chulalongkorn but left the cast after only three months, replaced by Ronnie Lee.

<p>Shortly before rehearsals began in January 1951, Rodgers had the first Tuptim, <ref target="/wiki/Doretta_Morrow" title="Doretta Morrow">Doretta Morrow</ref>, sing the entire score to Lawrence, including Lawrence's own songs. Lawrence listened calmly, but when she met Rodgers and Hammerstein the following day, she treated Rodgers coldly, apparently seeing the composer's actions as flaunting her vocal deficiencies.<ref target="#cite_note-Hyland200-44">[44]</ref> Hammerstein and Rodgers' doubts about whether Lawrence could handle the part were assuaged by the sheer force of her acting. James Poling, a writer for <ref target="/wiki/Collier%27s" title="Collier's">Collier's</ref> who was allowed to attend the rehearsals, wrote of Lawrence preparing "Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?":</p>

<p>She took the center of the barren stage wearing, for practice, a dirty muslin hoop over her slacks, with an old jacket thrown over her shoulders for warmth. She began rather quietly on the note, "Your servant! Your servant! Indeed I'm not your servant!" Then she gradually built the scene, slowly but powerfully, until, in a great crescendo, she ended prone on the floor, pounding in fury, and screaming, "Toads! Toads! Toads! All of your people are toads." When she finished, the handful of professionals in the theatre burst into admiring applause.<ref target="#cite_note-Secrest311-22">[22]</ref></p>

<p>At his first meeting with Sharaff, Brynner, who had only a fringe of hair, asked what he was to do about it. When told he was to shave it, Brynner was horror-struck and refused, convinced he would look terrible. He finally gave in during tryouts and put dark makeup on his shaved head. The effect was so well-received that it became Brynner's trademark.<ref target="#cite_note-45">[45]</ref></p>
<p>Lawrence's health caused her to miss several rehearsals, though no one knew what was wrong with her.<ref target="#cite_note-Hyland200-44">[44]</ref> When the tryout opened in <ref target="/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut" title="New Haven, Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</ref> on February 27, 1951, the show was nearly four hours long.

Additionally, when the show left New Haven for Boston for more tryout performances, it was still at least 45 minutes too long.<ref target="#cite_note-Nolan207-47">[47]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Gemze_de_Lappe" title="Gemze de Lappe">Gemze de Lappe</ref>, who was one of the dancers, recalled one cut that she regretted:</p>

<p>They took out a wonderful scene.

At the end she points her umbrella at him, or something like that, and the King says "Off with her head" or words to that effect, and the eunuchs pick her up and carry her off. The King says "Who, who, who?" with great satisfaction, and finds out that he has just thrown out the English schoolteacher. So he says, "Bring her back!" and she is ushered in ... we all loved it.<ref target="#cite_note-48">[48]</ref></p>

<p>This song, "Waiting", was a trio for Anna, the King, and the Kralahome (the King's prime minister). "Who Would Refuse?", the Kralahome's only solo, was also dropped. Left without a note to sing, Mervyn Vye abandoned the show and was replaced by John Juliano. "Now You Leave", a song for Lady Thiang (played by <ref target="/wiki/Dorothy_Sarnoff" title="Dorothy Sarnoff">Dorothy Sarnoff</ref> in the original production), was also cut.<ref target="#cite_note-Green233cast-42">[42]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-Nolan207-47">[47]</ref> After the cuts, Rodgers and Hammerstein felt that the first act was lacking something. Lawrence suggested that they write a song for Anna and the children. Mary Martin reminded them of a song that had been cut from South Pacific, "Suddenly Lucky". Hammerstein wrote a new lyric for the melody, and the resulting song became "Getting to Know You". "Western People Funny" and "I Have Dreamed" were also added in Boston.<ref target="#cite_note-Nolan208-29">[29]</ref></p>
<p>Brynner regretted that there were not more tryout performances, feeling that the schedule did not give him an adequate opportunity to develop the complex role of the King.

<h2>Plot[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_King_and_I&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Plot">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Act 1[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_King_and_I&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Act 1">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>In 1862, a strong-willed, widowed schoolteacher, Anna Leonowens, arrives in Bangkok, Siam (later known as Thailand) at the request of the King of Siam to tutor his many children. Anna's young son, Louis, fears the severe countenance of the King's prime minister, the Kralahome, but Anna refuses to be intimidated ("<ref target="/wiki/I_Whistle_a_Happy_Tune" title="I Whistle a Happy Tune">I Whistle a Happy Tune</ref>"). The Kralahome has come to escort them to the palace, where they are expected to live – a violation of Anna's contract, which calls for them to live in a separate house. She considers returning to Singapore aboard the vessel that brought them, but goes with her son and the Kralahome.</p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:King_1977.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:King_1977.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>The King (Brynner) presents (some of) his children to Anna (Constance Towers), 1977
<p>Several weeks pass, during which Anna and Louis are confined to their palace rooms. The King receives a gift from the king of Burma, a lovely slave girl named Tuptim, to be one of his many wives. She is escorted by Lun Tha, a scholar who has come to copy a design for a temple, and the two are secretly in love. Tuptim, left alone, declares that the King may own her, but not her heart ("My Lord and Master"). The King gives Anna her first audience. The schoolteacher is a part of his plan for the modernization of Siam; he is impressed when she already knows this. She raises the issue of her house with him, he dismisses her protests and orders her to talk with his wives. They are interested in her, and she tells them of her late husband, Tom ("Hello, Young Lovers"). The King presents her new pupils; Anna is to teach those of his children whose mothers are in favor with him – several dozen – and is to teach their mothers as well. The princes and princesses enter in procession ("March of the Royal Siamese Children"). Anna is charmed by the children, and formality breaks down after the ceremony as they crowd around her.</p>
<p>Anna has not given up on the house, and teaches the children proverbs and songs extolling the virtues of home life, to the King's irritation. The King has enough worries without battling the schoolteacher, and wonders why the world has become so complicated ("A Puzzlement"). The children and wives are hard at work learning English ("The Royal Bangkok Academy"). The children are surprised by a map showing how small Siam is compared with the rest of the world ("<ref target="/wiki/Getting_to_Know_You_(song)" title="Getting to Know You (song)">Getting to Know You</ref>"). As the <ref target="/wiki/Crown_prince" title="Crown prince">crown prince</ref>, Chulalongkorn, disputes the map, the King enters a chaotic schoolroom. He orders the pupils to believe the teacher but complains to Anna about her lessons about "home". Anna stands her ground and insists on the letter of her contract, threatening to leave Siam, much to the dismay of wives and children. The King orders her to obey as "my servant"; she repudiates the term and hurries away. The King dismisses school, then leaves, uncertain of his next action. Meanwhile, Lun Tha comes upon Tuptim, and they muse about having to hide their relationship ("We Kiss in a Shadow").</p>

<p>In her room, Anna replays the confrontation in her mind, her anger building ("Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?"). Lady Thiang, the King's head wife, tells Anna that the King is troubled by his portrayal in the West as a barbarian, as the British are being urged to take over Siam as a <ref target="/wiki/Protectorate" title="Protectorate">protectorate</ref>. Anna is shocked by the accusations – the King is a polygamist, but he is no barbarian – but she is reluctant to see him after their argument. Lady Thiang convinces her that the King is deserving of support ("Something Wonderful"). Anna goes to him and finds him anxious for reconciliation. The King tells her that the British are sending an envoy to Bangkok to evaluate the situation. Anna "guesses" – the only guise in which the King will accept advice – that the King will receive the envoy in European style, and that the wives will be dressed in Western fashion. Tuptim has been writing a play based on a book that Anna has lent her, <ref target="/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin" title="Uncle Tom's Cabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</ref>, that can be presented to the guests. News is brought to the King that the British are arriving much earlier than thought, and so Anna and the wives are to stay up all night to prepare. The King assembles his family for a Buddhist prayer for the success of the venture and also promises before Buddha that Anna will receive her own house "as provided in agreement, etc., etc."</p>

<h3>Act 2[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_King_and_I&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Act 2">edit</ref>]</h3>
<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Small_House_of_Uncle_Thomas.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Small_House_of_Uncle_Thomas.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>"The Small House of Uncle Thomas"
<p>The wives are dressed in their new European-style gowns, which they find confining ("Western People Funny"). In the rush to prepare, the question of undergarments has been overlooked, and the wives have practically nothing on underneath their gowns. When the British envoy, Sir Edward Ramsay, arrives and gazes at them through a monocle, they are panicked by the "evil eye" and lift their skirts over their heads as they flee. Sir Edward is diplomatic about the incident. When the King is called away, it emerges that Sir Edward is an old flame of Anna's, and they dance in remembrance of old times, as Edward urges her to return to British society. The King returns and irritably reminds them that dancing is for after dinner.</p>
<p>As final preparations for the play are made, Tuptim steals a moment to meet with Lun Tha. He tells her he has an escape plan, and she should be ready to leave after the performance ("I Have Dreamed"). Anna encounters them, and they confide in her ("Hello, Young Lovers", reprise). The play ("<ref target="/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin" title="Uncle Tom's Cabin">Small House of Uncle Thomas</ref>", narrated ballet) is presented in a Siamese ballet-inspired dance. Tuptim is the narrator, and she tells her audience of the evil King <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Simon_Legree" title="Simon Legree">Simon of Legree</ref> and his pursuit of the runaway slave <ref target="/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin#Eliza" title="Uncle Tom's Cabin">Eliza</ref>. Eliza is saved by <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Buddha" title="Buddha">Buddha</ref>, who miraculously freezes a river and conceals her in snow. Buddha then causes the river to melt, drowning King Simon and his hunting party. The anti-slavery message is blunt.</p>

<p>After the play, Sir Edward reveals that the British threat has receded, but the King is distracted by his displeasure at Tuptim's rebellious message. After Sir Edward leaves, Anna and the King express their delight at how well the evening went, and he presents her with a ring. Secret police report that Tuptim is missing. The King realizes that Anna knows something; she parries his inquiry by asking why he should care: Tuptim is just another woman to him. He is delighted; she is at last understanding the Siamese perspective. Anna tries to explain to him the Western customs of courtship and tells him what it is like for a young woman at a formal dance ("Shall We Dance?"). He demands that she teach him the dance. She does, and in that dance they experience and express a love for each other that they can never speak aloud. They are interrupted by the Kralahome. Tuptim has been captured, and a search is on for Lun Tha. The King resolves to punish Tuptim, though she denies she and Lun Tha were lovers. Anna tries to dissuade him, but he is determined that her influence shall not rule, and he takes the whip himself. He turns to lash Tuptim, but under Anna's gaze is unable to swing the whip, and hurries away. Lun Tha is found dead, and Tuptim is dragged off, swearing to kill herself; nothing more is heard about her. Anna asks the Kralahome to give her ring back to the King; both schoolteacher and minister state their wish that she had never come to Siam.</p>
<p>Several months pass with no contact between Anna and the King. Anna is packed and ready to board a ship leaving Siam. Chulalongkorn arrives with a letter from the King, who has been unable to resolve the conflicts within himself and is dying. Anna hurries to the King's bedside and they reconcile. The King persuades her to take back the ring and to stay and assist the next king, Chulalongkorn. The dying man tells Anna to take dictation from the prince, and instructs the boy to give orders as if he were King. The prince orders the end of the custom of <ref target="/wiki/Kowtow" title="Kowtow">kowtowing</ref> that Anna hated. The King grudgingly accepts this decision. As Chulalongkorn continues, prescribing a less arduous bow to show respect for the king, his father dies. Anna kneels by the late King, holding his hand and kissing it, as the wives and children bow or curtsey, a gesture of respect to old king and new.</p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Stjamestheatre.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Stjamestheatre.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>The King and I opened in 1951 at the <ref target="/wiki/St._James_Theatre" title="St. James Theatre">St. James Theatre</ref> (seen in 2006).
<p>The King and I opened on <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref> on March 29, 1951, with a wide expectation of a hit by the press and public. Both Hammerstein and Rodgers professed to be worried. The composer complained that most people were not concerned about whether the show was good, but whether it was better than South Pacific. Even the weather cooperated: heavy rain in New York stopped in time to allow the mostly wealthy or connected opening night audience to arrive dry at the <ref target="/wiki/St._James_Theatre" title="St. James Theatre">St. James Theatre</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-52">[52]</ref> Margaret Landon, author of the book on which the musical was based, was not invited to opening night.<ref target="#cite_note-53">[53]</ref></p>
<p>Brynner turned in an outstanding performance that night, nearly stealing the show. Lawrence knew that the company was nervous because of her illnesses. The director, John van Druten, described how her opening night performance put all worries to rest: "She came on the stage with a new and dazzling quality, as if an extra power had been granted to the brilliance of her stage light. She was radiant and wonderful."<ref target="#cite_note-Hyland202-54">[54]</ref> The rave reviews in the newspapers lifted Lawrence's spirits, and she expected a lengthy run as Anna, first on Broadway, then in London's <ref target="/wiki/West_End_theatre" title="West End theatre">West End</ref>, and finally on film.<ref target="#cite_note-55">[55]</ref> Lawrence won a <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Award" title="Tony Award">Tony Award</ref> for her leading role, while Brynner won the award for best featured actor. The show won the Tony for best musical, and designers Mielziner and Sharaff received awards in their categories.<ref target="#cite_note-TonyAwards-56">[56]</ref></p>
<p>De Lappe remembered the contrast between Lawrence's indifferent singing voice and the force of her performance:</p>

<p>I used to listen to Gertrude Lawrence on the public address system every night in our dressing rooms, and she'd get onto a note and sag down off of it. The night after I left the show to go into <ref target="/wiki/Paint_Your_Wagon_(musical)" title="Paint Your Wagon (musical)">Paint Your Wagon</ref>, Yul Brynner gave me house seats and I saw her from the front and I was so taken by her. She had such a star quality, you didn't care if she sang off-key. She more than dominated the stage. Boy, was that a lesson to me.<ref target="#cite_note-Secrest311-22">[22]</ref></p>

<p>Lawrence had not yet discovered that she was dying from <ref target="/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma" title="Hepatocellular carcinoma">liver cancer</ref>, and her weakened condition was exacerbated by the demands of her role. At the age of 52, she was required to wear dresses weighing 75 pounds (34 kg) while walking or dancing a total of 4 miles (6.4 km) during a 3½ hour performance eight times a week. Lawrence found it hard to bear the heat in the theatre during the summer months. Understudy <ref target="/wiki/Constance_Carpenter" title="Constance Carpenter">Constance Carpenter</ref> began replacing her in matinee performances. Later in the year Lawrence's strength returned, and she resumed her full schedule, but by Christmas she was battling <ref target="/wiki/Pleurisy" title="Pleurisy">pleurisy</ref> and suffering from exhaustion. She entered the hospital for a full week of tests. Just nine months before her death, the cancer still was not detected. In February 1952, <ref target="/wiki/Bronchitis" title="Bronchitis">bronchitis</ref> felled her for another week, and her husband Richard Aldrich asked Rodgers and Hammerstein if they would consider closing the show for Easter week to give her a chance to recover fully. They denied his request, but agreed to replace her with the original Ado Annie from Oklahoma!, <ref target="/wiki/Celeste_Holm" title="Celeste Holm">Celeste Holm</ref>, for six weeks during the summer.<ref target="#cite_note-Green233-57">[57]</ref> Meanwhile, Lawrence's performances were deteriorating, prompting audiences to become audibly restive. Rodgers and Hammerstein prepared a letter, never delivered, advising her that "eight times a week you are losing the respect of 1,500 people".<ref target="#cite_note-58">[58]</ref> In late August, Lawrence fainted following a matinee and was admitted to the <ref target="/wiki/NewYork%E2%80%93Presbyterian_Hospital" title="NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital">NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital</ref>. She slipped into a coma and died on September 6, 1952, aged 54. Her autopsy revealed liver cancer. On the day of her funeral, the performance of The King and I was cancelled.<ref target="#cite_note-59">[59]</ref> The lights of Broadway and the West End were dimmed; she was buried in the ball gown she wore during Act 2.<ref target="#cite_note-60">[60]</ref></p>
<p>Carpenter assumed the role of Anna and went on to play it for 620 performances.<ref target="#cite_note-61">[61]</ref> Other Annas during the run included Holm, <ref class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Annamary_Dickey&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Annamary Dickey (page does not exist)">Annamary Dickey</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Patricia_Morison" title="Patricia Morison">Patricia Morison</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-Hischak149-62">[62]</ref> Although Brynner later boasted of never missing a show, he missed several, once when stagehands at the St. James Theatre accidentally struck him in the nose with a piece of scenery, another time due to appendicitis.<ref target="#cite_note-63">[63]</ref> Also, for three months in 1952 (and occasionally in 1953), Alfred Drake replaced Brynner.<ref target="#cite_note-Green233-57">[57]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-64">[64]</ref> One young actor, <ref target="/wiki/Sal_Mineo" title="Sal Mineo">Sal Mineo</ref>, began as an extra, then became an understudy for a younger prince, then an understudy and later a replacement for Crown Prince Chulalongkorn.<ref target="#cite_note-65">[65]</ref> Mineo began a close friendship and working relationship with Brynner which would last for more than a decade.<ref target="#cite_note-66">[66]</ref> Another replacement was <ref target="/wiki/Terry_Saunders" title="Terry Saunders">Terry Saunders</ref> as Lady Thiang.<ref target="#cite_note-67">[67]</ref> She reprised the role in the 1956 film.

<h3>Brynner reprises the role[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_King_and_I&action=edit&section=12" title="Edit section: Brynner reprises the role">edit</ref>]</h3>

<p>In early 1976, Brynner received an offer from impresarios Lee Gruber and <ref target="/wiki/Shelly_Gross" title="Shelly Gross">Shelly Gross</ref> to star, in the role that he had created 25 years before, in a U.S. national tour and Broadway revival. The tour opened in Los Angeles on July 26, 1976, with Constance Towers reprising the role of Anna. On opening night, Brynner suffered so badly from laryngitis that he <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lip_synch" title="Lip synch">lip-synched</ref>, with his son Rock singing and speaking the role from the orchestra pit. The production traveled across the United States, selling out every city it appeared in and finally opening in New York at the Uris Theatre (today the <ref target="/wiki/Gershwin_Theatre" title="Gershwin Theatre">Gershwin Theatre</ref>) on May 2, 1977.<ref target="#cite_note-93">[93]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-NYTimesBarnes50-94">[94]</ref> The production featured <ref target="/wiki/Martin_Vidnovic" title="Martin Vidnovic">Martin Vidnovic</ref> as Lun Tha, and Susan Kikuchi danced the part of Eliza, recreating the role that her mother, Yuriko, had originated.<ref target="#cite_note-March22-69">[69]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-NYTimesBarnes50-94">[94]</ref> Yuriko both directed the production and recreated the Robbins choreography.

<p>Brynner insisted on renovations to the Uris before he would play there, stating that the theatre resembled "a public toilet".<ref target="#cite_note-Capua148-98">[98]</ref> He also insisted that dressing rooms on the tour and at the Uris be arranged to his satisfaction. According to his biographer Michelangelo Capua, for years afterwards, performers thanked Brynner for having backstage facilities across the country cleaned up.<ref target="#cite_note-Capua148-98">[98]</ref> New York Times reviewer <ref target="/wiki/Clive_Barnes" title="Clive Barnes">Clive Barnes</ref> said of the revival, "The cast is a good one. Mr. Brynner grinning fire and snorting charm is as near to the original as makes little difference" and called Towers "piquantly ladylike and sweet without being dangerously saccharine".<ref target="#cite_note-NYTimesBarnes50-94">[94]</ref> However, fellow Times critic <ref target="/wiki/Mel_Gussow" title="Mel Gussow">Mel Gussow</ref> warned, later in the run, that "to a certain extent [Brynner] was coasting on his charisma".<ref target="#cite_note-NYTimesGussow-99">[99]</ref></p>

The production then opened in the West End, at the <ref target="/wiki/London_Palladium" title="London Palladium">London Palladium</ref>, on June 12, 1979, and was reported to have the largest advance sale in English history.

Now, 33 years and 4,300 performances later, he is the king of the mountain as well as the show ...

<p>The first major revival to break away from the original staging and interpretation was an Australian production directed by <ref target="/wiki/Christopher_Renshaw" title="Christopher Renshaw">Christopher Renshaw</ref>, starring <ref target="/wiki/Hayley_Mills" title="Hayley Mills">Hayley Mills</ref> as Anna, in 1991. Renshaw pointedly ignored the printed stage directions in the script<ref target="#cite_note-Flatow-117">[117]</ref> when reshaping the piece into what he called "an authentic Thai experience".<ref target="#cite_note-Grossberg-118">[118]</ref> The production had a more sinister Siamese setting, a less elegant but more forceful Anna, and a younger King (Tony Marinyo).<ref target="#cite_note-Hischak150-72">[72]</ref> The attraction between Anna and the King was made explicit.<ref target="#cite_note-Secrest313-119">[119]</ref> Renshaw "cut a few lines and lyrics, and translated others into Thai to reinforce the atmosphere of a foreign land",<ref target="#cite_note-Grossberg-118">[118]</ref> and all Asian roles were played by Asian actors.<ref target="#cite_note-Flatow-117">[117]</ref> He also asked choreographers <ref target="/wiki/Lar_Lubovitch" title="Lar Lubovitch">Lar Lubovitch</ref> and Jerome Robbins to create a "spiritual" ballet, for the King's entrance in Act 1, and a procession with a sacred white elephant in Act II.<ref target="#cite_note-Grossberg-118">[118]</ref> According to Renshaw, "The reds and golds were very much inspired by what we saw at the royal palace",<ref target="#cite_note-Grossberg-118">[118]</ref> and set and costume elements reflected images, architecture and other designs in the palace and elsewhere in Bangkok.<ref target="#cite_note-Flatow-117">[117]</ref> For example, the stage was framed by columns of elephant figures, a large <ref target="/wiki/Emerald_Buddha" title="Emerald Buddha">emerald Buddha</ref> loomed over Act I, and hundreds of elephant images were woven into the set. Renshaw said, "The elephant is regarded as a very holy creature ... they believe the spirit of Buddha often resides in the form of the elephant."<ref target="#cite_note-Grossberg-118">[118]</ref></p>
<p>Stanley Green, in his Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre, viewed the central theme of The King and I as "the importance of mutual understanding between people of differing ethnic and cultural backgrounds",<ref target="#cite_note-Green233-57">[57]</ref> but Renshaw felt that the musical suffered from 1950s attitudes when "Orientalism was used as an exoticism rather than a real understanding of the particular culture."<ref target="#cite_note-Grossberg-118">[118]</ref> He stated that his production was informed by authentic Thai cultural, aesthetic and religious ideas that he learned from visiting Thailand. A feature in Playbill commented that the production focused on the "clash of ideologies and cultures, of East versus West".<ref target="#cite_note-Flatow-117">[117]</ref> Theatre arts professor Eileen Blumenthal, however, called the production "a King and I for the age of political correctness".<ref target="#cite_note-Blumenthal-120">[120]</ref> While she acknowledged that the musical's treatment of Asian cultures had come to be understood as insensitive in the nearly half century since its premiere, she argued that Rodgers and Hammerstein's script was more sensitive than most orientalist literature of its day, in that "West learns from East as well as the other way around", and that, moreover, the musical's treatment of its Asian subject is fantastical, not intended to be realistic.<ref target="#cite_note-Blumenthal-120">[120]</ref> She concluded that the show is a documentary of "who we've been" in the West, and that a work like The King and I should not be suppressed, because it is "too good".<ref target="#cite_note-Blumenthal-120">[120]</ref></p>

<p>In his music, Rodgers sought to give some of the music an Asian flavor. This is exhibited in the piercing <ref target="/wiki/Major_second" title="Major second">major seconds</ref> that frame "A Puzzlement", the flute melody in "We Kiss in a Shadow", <ref target="/wiki/Perfect_fifth#Bare_fifth,_open_fifth,_or_empty_fifth" title="Perfect fifth">open fifths</ref>, the exotic 6/2 chords that shape "My Lord and Master", and in some of the incidental music.<ref target="#cite_note-MillerExotic-23">[23]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-168">[168]</ref> The music for "The Small House of Uncle Thomas" was for the most part written not by Rodgers, but by dance music arranger Trude Rittmann, though "Hello, Young Lovers" and a snatch of "A Puzzlement" are quoted within it.<ref target="#cite_note-Mordden142-169">[169]</ref></p>
<p>Before Rodgers and Hammerstein began writing together, the <ref target="/wiki/Thirty-two-bar_form" title="Thirty-two-bar form">AABA form</ref> for <ref target="/wiki/Show_tune" title="Show tune">show tunes</ref> was standard, but many of the songs in The King and I vary from it. "I Have Dreamed" is an almost continuous repetition of variations on the same theme, until the ending, when it is capped by another melody. The first five notes (an <ref target="/wiki/Tuplet#triplets" title="Tuplet">eighth note triplet</ref> and two <ref target="/wiki/Half_note" title="Half note">half notes</ref>) of "Getting to Know You" also carry the melody all the way through the refrain.

Hyland">William Hyland</ref>, the score for The King and I is much more closely tied to the action than that of South Pacific, "which had its share of purely entertaining songs".<ref target="#cite_note-Hyland198-170">[170]</ref> For example, the opening song, "I Whistle a Happy Tune", establishes Anna's fear upon entering a strange land with her small son, but the merry melody also expresses her determination to keep a stiff upper lip.<ref target="#cite_note-Hyland198-170">[170]</ref> Hyland calls "Hello, Young Lovers" an archetypical Rodgers ballad: simple, with only two chords in the first eight bars, but moving in its directness.<ref target="#cite_note-Hyland198-170">[170]</ref></p>

While <ref target="/wiki/John_Kenrick_(theatre_writer)" title="John Kenrick (theatre writer)">John Kenrick</ref> admires it for the performances of the secondary couple, Larry Douglas and Doretta Morrow, and for the warmth of Lawrence's performance, he notes that "Shall We Dance" was abridged, and there are no children's voices – the chorus in "Getting to Know You" is made up of adults.<ref target="#cite_note-Kenrick-171">[171]</ref> In 2000, the recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.<ref target="#cite_note-172">[172]</ref> Later in the same year <ref target="/wiki/Patrice_Munsel" title="Patrice Munsel">Patrice Munsel</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Robert_Merrill" title="Robert Merrill">Robert Merrill</ref> made the first studio recording of selections from the musical.<ref target="#cite_note-Hischak152-173">[173]</ref> Hischak comments that in the <ref target="/wiki/The_King_and_I_(1953_London_cast_album)" title="The King and I (1953 London cast album)">1953 London cast album</ref>, Valerie Hobson's vocals were no stronger than Lawrence's and that the highlight is <ref target="/wiki/Muriel_Smith" title="Muriel Smith">Muriel Smith</ref>'s "Something Wonderful" in a disc with too many cuts. He calls Anna's songs "well served" by Marni Nixon's singing in the 1956 film soundtrack and judges the recording as vocally satisfying;<ref target="#cite_note-Hischak152-173">[173]</ref> Kenrick describes it as a "mixed bag": he is pleased that it includes several songs cut from the film, and he praises Nixon's vocals, but he dislikes the supporting cast and suggests watching the movie instead for its visual splendor.<ref target="#cite_note-Kenrick-171">[171]</ref></p>

<p>Kenrick prefers the 1964 Lincoln Center cast recording to the earlier ones, especially approving of the performances of Risë Stevens as Anna and Patricia Neway as Lady Thiang.<ref target="#cite_note-Kenrick-171">[171]</ref> The recording, for the first time, included the narrated ballet music for "The Small House of Uncle Thomas". Because a single <ref target="/wiki/LP_record" title="LP record">LP</ref> limited a single-disc album to about fifty minutes, its inclusion required the absence of some of the other numbers.<ref target="#cite_note-174">[174]</ref> Kenrick finds the recording of the 1977 Broadway revival cast to be "[e]asily the most satisfying King & I on CD". He judges it to be Brynner's best performance, calling Towers "great" and Martin Vidnovic, June Angela and the rest of the supporting cast "fabulous", though lamenting the omission of the ballet. Hischak, in contrast, says that some might prefer Brynner in his earlier recordings, when he was "more vibrant".<ref target="#cite_note-Hischak152-173">[173]</ref> Kenrick enjoys the <ref target="/wiki/The_King_and_I_(1992_studio_cast_album)" title="The King and I (1992 studio cast album)">1992 Angel studio recording</ref> mostly for the Anna of <ref target="/wiki/Julie_Andrews" title="Julie Andrews">Julie Andrews</ref>, who he says is "pure magic" in a role she never performed on stage.<ref target="#cite_note-Kenrick-171">[171]</ref> Kenrick praises the performance of both stars on the 1996 Broadway revival recording, calling Lou Diamond Phillips "that rarity, a King who can stand free of Brynner's shadow".<ref target="#cite_note-Kenrick-171">[171]</ref> Hischak finds the soundtrack to the 1999 animated film with Christiane Noll as Anna and Martin Vidnovic as the King, as well as Barbra Streisand singing on one track, more enjoyable than the movie itself,<ref target="#cite_note-Hischak152-173">[173]</ref> but Kenrick writes that his sole use for that CD is as a coaster.<ref target="#cite_note-Kenrick-171">[171]</ref></p>

<p>The balance of opinion among the critics of the original London production was generally favorable, with a few reservations. In <ref target="/wiki/The_Observer" title="The Observer">The Observer</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Ivor_Brown" title="Ivor Brown">Ivor Brown</ref> predicted that the piece would "settle down for some years at Drury Lane."<ref target="#cite_note-177">[177]</ref> The anonymous critic of <ref target="/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The Times</ref> compared the work to <ref target="/wiki/Gilbert_and_Sullivan" title="Gilbert and Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</ref>: "Mr. Rodgers charmingly echoes Sullivan in the king's more topsy-turvy moments; and Mr. Hammerstein attends very skilfully to the lurking Gilbertian humour."<ref target="#cite_note-178">[178]</ref> Less favorably, in the <ref target="/wiki/Daily_Express" title="Daily Express">Daily Express</ref>, John Barber called the work "this treacle-bin <ref target="/wiki/The_Mikado" title="The Mikado">Mikado</ref>", and declared that only one of the cast, Muriel Smith, could really sing.<ref target="#cite_note-179">[179]</ref></p>

<p>In 1963, New York Times reviewer Lewis Funke said of the musical, "Mr. Hammerstein put all of his big heart into the simple story of a British woman's adventures, heartaches, and triumphs. ... A man with a world-view, he seized the opportunity provided by [Landon's book] to underscore his thoughts on the common destiny of humanity."<ref target="#cite_note-180">[180]</ref> Fourteen years later, another Times reviewer, Clive Barnes, called the musical "unsophisticated and untroubled. Even its shadows are lightened with a laugh or a sweetly sentimental tear ... we can even be persuaded to take death as a happy ending".<ref target="#cite_note-NYTimesBarnes50-94">[94]</ref></p>
<p>The reworked 1996 Broadway production received mixed reviews. <ref target="/wiki/Vincent_Canby" title="Vincent Canby">Vincent Canby</ref> of The New York Times disliked it: "This latest King and I might look like a million dollars as a regional production; on Broadway ... it's a disappointment. The score remains enchanting but, somewhere along the line, there has been a serious failure of the theatrical imagination."<ref target="#cite_note-181">[181]</ref> But <ref target="/wiki/Liz_Smith_(journalist)" title="Liz Smith (journalist)">Liz Smith</ref> enthused: "The King and I is perfect"; and the <ref target="/wiki/Houston_Chronicle" title="Houston Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</ref> wrote, of the subsequent tour, "The King and I is the essence of musical theater, an occasion when drama, music, dance and decor combine to take the audience on an unforgettable journey."<ref target="#cite_note-182">[182]</ref> Critic Richard Christiansen in the <ref target="/wiki/Chicago_Tribune" title="Chicago Tribune">Chicago Tribune</ref> observed, of a 1998 tour stop at the <ref target="/wiki/Auditorium_Theatre" title="Auditorium Theatre">Auditorium Theatre</ref>: "Written in a more leisurely and innocent and less politically correct period, [The King and I] cannot escape the 1990s onus of its condescending attitude toward the pidgin English monarch and his people. And its story moves at a pace that's a mite too slow for this more hurried day and age."<ref target="#cite_note-183">[183]</ref> When the production reached London in 2000, however, it received uniformly positive reviews; the <ref target="/wiki/Financial_Times" title="Financial Times">Financial Times</ref> called it "a handsome, spectacular, strongly performed introduction to one of the truly great musicals".<ref target="#cite_note-AlbemarleLondon-132">[132]</ref></p>
<p>The 2015 Broadway revival initially received uniformly glowing reviews. Ben Brantley of The New York Times called it a "resplendent production" and commented:</p>

<p>[In the] 1996 production ... [a] dark strain of sadomasochistic tension born of Victorian repression and Eastern sensuality was introduced into sunny Siam. ... Mr. Sher is no strong-armed revisionist. He works from within vintage material, coaxing shadowy emotional depths to churn up a surface that might otherwise seem shiny and slick. ... [T]he show is both panoramic and personal, balancing dazzling musical set pieces with sung introspective soliloquies. [The direction] enhances [scenes'] emotional weight. No one is merely a dancer or an extra or an archetype, which may be the greatest defense this show offers against what can come across as cute condescension toward the exotic East. ... [The] portrayal of the varied forms and content of love [and] some of [Rodgers and Hammerstein's] lushest ballads ... acquire freshening nuance and anchoring conviction".<ref target="#cite_note-Brantley2015-145">[145]</ref></p>

<p>Marilyn Stasio, in Variety, termed the production "sumptuous" and "absolutely stunning". She noted a "still pertinent theme: the dissonant dynamic when Western civilization tries to assert its values on ancient Eastern cultures."<ref target="#cite_note-184">[184]</ref> In <ref target="/wiki/USA_Today" title="USA Today">USA Today</ref>, Elysa Gardner wrote of the grins and tears evoked by the production. "[W]atching these people from vastly different cultures carefully but joyfully reach for common ground ... can be almost unbearably moving. ... [Rodgers and Hammerstein's] textured humanity and appeals for tolerance, like their shimmering scores, only gain resonance as time passes."<ref target="#cite_note-185">[185]</ref> The production's attempts to achieve historical accuracy and explore the work's dark themes with a modern sensibility led some reviewers to conclude that it succeeds at converting the musical's <ref target="/wiki/Orientalism" title="Orientalism">orientalism</ref> into "a modern critique of racism and sexism".<ref target="#cite_note-186">[186]</ref> Other commentators, however, such as composer <ref target="/wiki/Mohammed_Fairouz" title="Mohammed Fairouz">Mohammed Fairouz</ref>, argued that an attempt at sensitivity in production cannot compensate for "the inaccurate portrayal of the historic King Mongkut as a childlike tyrant and the infantilization of the entire Siamese population of the court", which demonstrate a racist subtext in the piece, even in 1951 when it was written.<ref target="#cite_note-187">[187]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Benjamin_Ivry" title="Benjamin Ivry">Benjamin Ivry</ref> opined that "the Rodgers and Hammerstein organization should shelve the [musical] as a humanitarian gesture toward Southeast Asian history and art".<ref target="#cite_note-188">[188]</ref></p>
<p>Fifty years after its premiere, Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest summed up the musical:</p>

<p>The King and I is really a celebration of love in all its guises, from the love of Anna for her dead husband; the love of the King's official wife, Lady Thiang, for a man she knows is flawed and also unfaithful; the desperation of forbidden love; and a love that is barely recognized and can never be acted upon.<ref target="#cite_note-189">[189]</ref></p>
