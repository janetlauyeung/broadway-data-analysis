<p>Addams' original <ref target="/wiki/Cartoon" title="Cartoon">cartoons</ref> were one-panel gags. The characters were undeveloped and unnamed until the television series production.</p>

Morticia is even in disposition, muted, witty, sometimes deadly. Grandma Frump is foolishly good-natured. Wednesday is her mother's daughter. A closely knit family, the real head being Morticia—although each of the others is a definite character—except for Grandma, who is easily led. Many of the troubles they have as a family are due to Grandma's fumbling, weak character. The house is a wreck, of course, but this is a house-proud family just the same and every trap door is in good repair. Money is no problem.— Charles Addams<ref target="#cite_note-evilution-17">[14]</ref></p>

<p>The family appears to be a single surviving branch of the Addams clan. Many other "Addams families" exist all over the world. According to the film version, the family credo is, Sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc (<ref target="/wiki/Dog_Latin" title="Dog Latin">pseudo-Latin</ref>: "We gladly feast on those who would subdue us"). Charles Addams was first inspired by his hometown of <ref target="/wiki/Westfield,_New_Jersey" title="Westfield, New Jersey">Westfield</ref>, New Jersey, an area full of ornate <ref target="/wiki/Victorian_architecture" title="Victorian architecture">Victorian</ref> mansions and archaic graveyards.<ref target="#cite_note-18">[15]</ref> In the original comics series they live in a gothic house on Cemetery Ridge. According to the television series, they live in a gloomy mansion adjacent to a cemetery and a <ref target="/wiki/Swamp" title="Swamp">swamp</ref>. In <ref target="/wiki/The_Addams_Family_(musical)" title="The Addams Family (musical)">The Addams Family musical</ref> (first shown in Chicago in 2009), the house is located in <ref target="/wiki/Central_Park" title="Central Park">Central Park</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-19">[16]</ref></p>
<p>Although most of the humor derives from the fact that they share <ref target="/wiki/Macabre" title="Macabre">macabre</ref> interests, the Addamses are not evil. They are a close-knit <ref target="/wiki/Extended_family" title="Extended family">extended family</ref>. Morticia is an exemplary mother, and she and Gomez remain passionate towards each other. Created by the television series writers, she calls him <ref target="/wiki/Yiddish_words_used_in_English#B" title="Yiddish words used in English">"bubbeleh"</ref>,<ref target="#cite_note-20">[17]</ref> to which he responds by kissing her arms, behavior Morticia can also provoke by speaking a few words in French (the meaning is not important; any French will do). The parents are supportive of their children. The family is friendly and hospitable to visitors, in some cases willing to donate large sums of money to causes (television series and films), despite the visitors' horror at the Addamses' peculiar lifestyle.</p>
<p>Charles Addams began as a cartoonist in <ref target="/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</ref> with a sketch of a window washer that ran on February 6, 1932.<ref target="#cite_note-maslin-21">[18]</ref> His cartoons ran regularly in the magazine from 1938, when he drew the first instance of what came to be called The Addams Family, until his death in 1988.<ref target="#cite_note-maslin-21">[18]</ref></p>
<p>In 1946, Addams met science-fiction writer <ref target="/wiki/Ray_Bradbury" title="Ray Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</ref> after having drawn an illustration for Bradbury's short story "Homecoming" in <ref target="/wiki/Mademoiselle_(magazine)" title="Mademoiselle (magazine)">Mademoiselle</ref> magazine, the first in a series of tales chronicling a family of <ref target="/wiki/Illinois" title="Illinois">Illinois</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Monster" title="Monster">monsters</ref>, the Elliotts. Bradbury and Addams became friends and planned to collaborate on a book of the Elliott Family's complete history, with Bradbury writing and Addams providing the illustrations; but it never materialized. Bradbury's Elliott Family stories were anthologized in <ref target="/wiki/From_the_Dust_Returned" title="From the Dust Returned">From the Dust Returned</ref> (2001), with a connecting narrative, an explanation of his work with Addams, and Addams's 1946 Mademoiselle illustration used for the book's cover jacket. Although Addams's own characters were well established by the time of their initial encounter, in a 2001 interview, Bradbury states that Addams "went his way and created the Addams Family and I went my own way and created my family in this book."<ref target="#cite_note-22">[19]</ref></p>

<p>The first animated series ran on Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1975 on <ref target="/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</ref>. In a departure from the original series, this series took the Addamses on the road in a Victorian-style <ref target="/wiki/Mobile_home" title="Mobile home">RV</ref>. This series also marked the point where the relations between characters were changed so that Fester was now Gomez's brother, and Grandmama was now Morticia's mother (though the old relations would be revisited in the 1977 television movie, to retain continuity with the original sitcom). Although Coogan and Cassidy reprised their roles, Astin and Jones did not, their parts being recast with Hanna-Barbera voice talents <ref target="/wiki/Lennie_Weinrib" title="Lennie Weinrib">Lennie Weinrib</ref> as Gomez and <ref target="/wiki/Janet_Waldo" title="Janet Waldo">Janet Waldo</ref> as Morticia, while a ten-year-old <ref target="/wiki/Jodie_Foster" title="Jodie Foster">Jodie Foster</ref> provided the voice of Pugsley. Again, the characters were drawn to the specifications of the original Charles Addams cartoons. One season was produced, and the second season consisted of reruns. A complementary comic book series was produced in connection with the show, but it lasted only three issues. The show's theme music was completely different and had no lyrics and no finger snaps, although it retained a bit of the four-note score from the live-action show.</p>

It features most of the original cast, except <ref target="/wiki/Blossom_Rock" title="Blossom Rock">Blossom Rock</ref>, who had played Grandmama. She was still alive but was very ill at the time; she was replaced by Jane Rose.

The movie has a slightly different version of the theme song; the finger snaps are used but not the lyrics.</p>
<p>Gomez and Morticia have had two more children, Wednesday, Jr. and Pugsley, Jr., who strongly resemble their older siblings. Gomez's brother, Pancho, is staying with the family while Gomez attends a lodge meeting in <ref target="/wiki/Tombstone,_Arizona" title="Tombstone, Arizona">Tombstone, Arizona</ref>. Gomez is jealous of his brother, who once courted Morticia. <ref target="/wiki/Halloween" title="Halloween">Halloween</ref> is nigh, and Pancho tells the children the legend of the <ref target="/wiki/Great_Pumpkin" title="Great Pumpkin">Great Pumpkin</ref>-like character of Cousin Shy, who distributes gifts and carves pumpkins for good children on Halloween night. Wednesday (now called "Wednesday, Sr.") is home from music academy, where she is studying the <ref target="/wiki/Piccolo" title="Piccolo">piccolo</ref> (breaking glass with it). Pugsley (now "Pugsley, Sr.") is home from <ref target="/wiki/Nairobi" title="Nairobi">Nairobi</ref> medical school, where he is training to be a <ref target="/wiki/Witch_doctor" title="Witch doctor">witch doctor</ref>. The family's home has been bugged by a gang of crooks who intend to steal the family fortune. Lafferty, the boss, sends a gang member named Mikey into the house to investigate. Mikey panics and flees after treading on the tail of Kitty Kat the lion. The crooks employ a fake Gomez and Morticia to help in their plans, along with two strong-arm goons, Hercules and Atlas. Gomez returns home for the Halloween party and trimming of the <ref target="/wiki/Scarecrow" title="Scarecrow">scarecrow</ref>. Lafferty poses as Quincy Addams (from Boston) to gain entrance to the house during the party. He has his men tie up Gomez and Morticia, and his doubles take their places, confusing Pancho, who is still in love with Morticia, and Ophelia, who is still in love with Gomez. Gomez and Morticia escape (thanks to the "Old Piccolo Game"), and rejoin the party, only to have Lafferty use various methods to try to get rid of them. Lurch scares off the thugs and terrifies Lafferty's other assistant. Fester, trying to be nice, puts Lafferty on the rack. Lafferty tries to escape through the secret passage and steps on Kitty Kat's tail. When the police arrive, the crooks gladly surrender. The Addamses are then free to celebrate Halloween happily, ending the night by singing together in welcome for Cousin Shy.</p>

New artistic models of the characters were used for this series, though still having a passing resemblance to the original cartoons. Two seasons were produced, with the third year containing reruns. Oddly in this series, Wednesday maintained her macabre, brooding attitude from the Addams Family movies, but her facial expressions and body language conveyed the happy-go-lucky, fun attitude of her portrayal in the original television show.

The book details the family's arrival in their new home and explains how it got its bizarre décor. The arrival and origins of Thing are explained. Each chapter reads as a self-contained story, like episodes of the television show. The novel concludes with the Addams family discovering that their lives will be the basis for a new television series. It was published in paperback by <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pyramid_Books" title="Pyramid Books">Pyramid Books</ref> in 1965.<ref target="#cite_note-Publication:_The_Addams_Family-32">[29]</ref></p>

<h4>The Addams Family Strikes Back[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Addams_Family&action=edit&section=23" title="Edit section: The Addams Family Strikes Back">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>The Addams Family Strikes Back by W.F. Miksch tells how Gomez plans to rehabilitate the image of <ref target="/wiki/Benedict_Arnold" title="Benedict Arnold">Benedict Arnold</ref> by running for the local school board. The tone and characterizations in this book resemble the TV characters much more closely than in the first novel. Cousin Itt appears as a minor character in this story, but as a tiny, three-legged creature rather than the hairy, derby-hatted character seen on television and in the movies. The novel was published in paperback form by Pyramid Books in 1965.<ref target="#cite_note-Publication:_The_Addams_Family-32">[29]</ref></p>
