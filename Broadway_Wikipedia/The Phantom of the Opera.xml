<h2>History behind the novel[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: History behind the novel">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Leroux initially was going to be a lawyer, but after spending his inheritance gambling he became a reporter for <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/L%E2%80%99Echo_de_Paris" title="L’Echo de Paris">L’Echo de Paris</ref>. At the paper, he wrote about and critiqued dramas, as well as being a courtroom reporter. With his job, he was able to travel frequently, but he returned to Paris where he became a writer. Because of his fascination with both <ref target="/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</ref> and Sir <ref target="/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle" title="Arthur Conan Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</ref>, he wrote a detective mystery entitled <ref target="/wiki/The_Mystery_of_the_Yellow_Room" title="The Mystery of the Yellow Room">The Mystery of the Yellow Room</ref> in 1907, and four years later he published Le Fantôme de l’Opéra.<ref target="#cite_note-:02-3">[3]</ref> The novel was first published within newspapers before finally being published as a novel in 1911.<ref target="#cite_note-:12-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>The setting of The Phantom of the Opera came from an actual Paris opera house that Leroux had heard the rumours about from the time the opera house was finished. The details about the <ref target="/wiki/Palais_Garnier" title="Palais Garnier">Palais Garnier</ref>, and rumours surrounding it, are closely linked in Leroux's writing. The underground lake that he wrote about is accurate to this opera house, and it is still used for training firefighters to practice swimming in the dark. The event that was the infamous chandelier crash also rang to be true.<ref target="#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> The mysteries that Leroux uses in his novel about the Phantom are still mysteries.<ref target="#cite_note-:2-6">[6]</ref> However, he defended the rumors to be true, even on his death bed.<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>The Phantom of the Opera's origins came from Leroux's curiosity with the Phantom being real. In the prologue, he tells the readers about the Phantom and the research that he did to prove the truth of the ghost. His findings connected the corpse from the opera house to the Persian phantom himself.<ref target="#cite_note-8">[8]</ref></p>

<h2>Plot summary[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Plot summary">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>In <ref target="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</ref> in the 1880s, the <ref target="/wiki/Palais_Garnier" title="Palais Garnier">Palais Garnier</ref> opera house is believed to be haunted by an entity known as the Phantom of the Opera, or simply the Opera Ghost. A stagehand named Joseph Buquet is found hanged and the rope around his neck goes missing. At a gala performance for the retirement of the opera house's two managers, a young little-known Swedish soprano, <ref target="/wiki/Christine_Daa%C3%A9" title="Christine Daaé">Christine Daaé</ref> (based on the late singer <ref target="/wiki/Christina_Nilsson" title="Christina Nilsson">Christina Nilsson</ref><ref target="#cite_note-:0-9">[9]</ref>), is called upon to sing in place of the Opera's leading soprano, Carlotta, who is ill, and her performance is an astonishing success. The Vicomte Raoul de Chagny, who was present at the performance, recognizes her as his childhood playmate and recalls his love for her. He attempts to visit her backstage, where he hears a man complimenting her from inside her dressing room. He investigates the room once Christine leaves, only to find it empty.</p>
<p>At <ref target="/wiki/Perros-Guirec" title="Perros-Guirec">Perros-Guirec</ref>, Christine meets with Raoul, who confronts her about the voice he heard in her room. Christine tells him she has been tutored by the Angel of Music, whom her father used to tell them about. When Raoul suggests that she might be the victim of a prank, she storms off. Christine visits her father's grave one night, where a mysterious figure appears and plays the violin for her. Raoul attempts to confront it but is attacked and knocked out in the process.</p>
<p>Back at the Palais Garnier, the new managers receive a letter from the Phantom demanding that they allow Christine to perform the lead role of Marguerite in <ref target="/wiki/Faust_(opera)" title="Faust (opera)">Faust</ref>, and that box 5 be left empty for his use, lest they perform in a house with a curse on it. The managers ignore his demands as a prank, resulting in disastrous consequences: Carlotta (based on the late singer Madmoiselle Carvalho<ref target="#cite_note-:0-9">[9]</ref>) ends up croaking like a toad, and the chandelier suddenly drops into the audience, killing a spectator. The Phantom, having abducted Christine from her dressing room, reveals himself as a deformed man called <ref target="/wiki/Erik_(The_Phantom_of_the_Opera)" title="Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)">Erik</ref>. Erik intends to hold her prisoner in his lair with him for a few days, but she causes him to change his plans when she unmasks him and, to the horror of both, beholds his noseless, lipless, sunken-eyed face, which resembles a skull dried up by the centuries, covered in yellowed dead flesh.</p>
<p>Fearing that she will leave him, he decides to kidnap her permanently, but when Christine requests release after two weeks, he agrees on the condition that she wear his ring and be faithful to him. On the roof of the opera house, Christine tells Raoul about her abduction and makes Raoul promise to take her away to a place where Erik can never find her, even if she resists. Raoul tells Christine he will act on his promise the next day, to which she agrees. However, Christine sympathizes with Erik and decides to sing for him one last time as a means of saying goodbye. Unbeknownst to Christine and Raoul, Erik has been watching them and overheard their whole conversation.</p>
<p>The following night, the enraged and jealous Erik abducts Christine during a production of Faust and tries to force her to marry him. Raoul is led by a mysterious opera regular known as "The Persian" into Erik's secret lair deep in the bowels of the opera house, but they end up trapped in a mirrored room by Erik, who threatens that unless Christine agrees to marry him, he will kill them and everyone in the Opera House by using explosives. Christine agrees to marry Erik. Erik initially tries to drown Raoul and the Persian, using the water which would have been used to douse the explosives, but Christine begs and offers to be his "living bride", promising him not to kill herself after becoming his bride, as she had both contemplated and attempted just prior. Erik eventually releases Raoul and the Persian from his torture chamber.</p>
<p>When Erik is alone with Christine, he lifts his mask to kiss her on her forehead and is given a kiss back. Erik reveals that he has never received a kiss, not even from his own mother, nor has he been allowed to give one, and is overcome with emotion. He and Christine then cry together and their tears "mingle". Erik later says that he has never felt so close to another human being. He allows the Persian and Raoul to escape, though not before making Christine promise that she will visit him on his death day, and return the gold ring he gave her. He also makes the Persian promise that afterward he will go to the newspaper and report his death, as he will die soon and will die "of love". Indeed, sometime later Christine returns to Erik's lair, buries him somewhere where he will never be found (by Erik's request) and returns the gold ring. Afterward, a local newspaper runs the simple note: "Erik is dead". Christine and Raoul (who finds out that Erik has killed his older brother) elope together, never to return.</p>
<p>The story ends with passages narrated directly by the Persian and the final chapter that pieces together Erik's life. It is revealed that Erik was the son of a construction business owner, deformed from birth. He ran away from his native Normandy to work in fairs and in caravans, schooling himself in the arts of the circus across Europe and Asia, and eventually building trick palaces in Persia and Turkey. Eventually, he returned to France and, wearing a mask, started his own construction business. After being subcontracted to work on the foundations of the Palais Garnier, Erik had discreetly built himself a lair to disappear in, complete with hidden passages and other tricks that allowed him to spy on the managers.</p>

<h2>Themes[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Themes">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Music[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Music">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Leroux uses the operatic setting in The Phantom of the Opera to use music as a device for foreshadowing.<ref target="#cite_note-Mireille_Ribière_Writings,_Photographs-10">[10]</ref> Ribière makes note that Leroux was once a theatre critic and his brother was a musician, so he was knowledgeable about music and how to use it as a framing device. She uses the example of how Leroux introduces Danse Macabre which means "dance of death" in the gala scene which foreshadows the graveyard scene that comes later where the Phantom plays the fiddle for Christine and attacks Raoul when he tries to intervene.</p>
<p>Drumright points out that music is evident throughout the novel in that it is the basis for Christine and Erik's relationship. Christine sees Erik as her Angel of Music that her father promised would come to her one day. The Phantom sees Christine as his musical protege, and he uses his passion for music to teach her everything he knows.<ref target="#cite_note-:12-4">[4]</ref></p>

<h3>Mystery[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Mystery">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Stylistically, the novel is framed as a mystery novel as it is narrated through a detective pulling his information from various forms of research.<ref target="#cite_note-Cathleen_Myers-11">[11]</ref> The mystery being uncovered is the Phantom who lurks through the opera house, seemingly appearing in places out of nowhere as if by magic. But, it seems that the mystery novel persona was a facade for the real genre being more of a gothic romance. <ref target="#cite_note-Sean_Fitzpatrick-12">[12]</ref></p>

<h3>Gothic horror[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera&action=edit&section=7" title="Edit section: Gothic horror">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>In his article, Fitzpatrick compares the Phantom to other monsters featured in <ref target="/wiki/Gothic_fiction" title="Gothic fiction">Gothic horror novels</ref> such as <ref target="/wiki/Frankenstein%27s_monster" title="Frankenstein's monster">Frankenstein's monster</ref>, Dr. Jekyll, Dorian Gray, and <ref target="/wiki/Count_Dracula" title="Count Dracula">Count Dracula</ref>. The Phantom has a torture chamber where he kidnaps and kills people, and the walls of the chapel in the graveyard are lined with human bones.<ref target="#cite_note-Sean_Fitzpatrick-12">[12]</ref> Indeed, Drumright notes that The Phantom of the Opera checks off every trope necessary to have a Gothic novel according to the Encyclopedia of Literature's description which says, “Such novels were expected to be dark and tempestuous and full of ghosts, madness, outrage,</p>
<p>superstition, and revenge.”<ref target="#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> Although the Phantom is really just a deformed man, he has ghost-like qualities in that no one can ever find him or his lair and he is seen as a monster. People are frightened by him because of his deformities and the acts of violence he commits.<ref target="#cite_note-:12-4">[4]</ref></p>

<h3>Romance[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: Romance">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The novel features a <ref target="/wiki/Love_triangle" title="Love triangle">love triangle</ref> between the Phantom, Christine, and Raoul. Raoul is seen as Christine's childhood love whom she is familiar with and has affection for. He is rich and therefore offers her security as well as a wholesome, Christian marriage. The Phantom, on the other hand, is not familiar. He is dark, ugly, and dangerous and therefore represents the forbidden love. However, Christine is drawn to him because she sees him as her Angel of Music, and she pities his existence of loneliness and darkness.<ref target="#cite_note-:12-4">[4]</ref></p>

<h2>Critical reception[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera&action=edit&section=9" title="Edit section: Critical reception">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>By the time Leroux published The Phantom of the Opera, he had already gained credibility as a crime mystery author in both French- and English-speaking countries. He had written six novels prior, two of which had garnered substantial popularity within their first year of publication called The Mystery of the Yellow Room and The Perfume of the Lady in Black.<ref target="#cite_note-Mireille_Ribière_Writings,_Photographs-10">[10]</ref> Although previous commentators have asserted that The Phantom of the Opera did not attain as much success as these previous novels, being particularly unpopular in France where it was first published,<ref target="#cite_note-Peter_Haining-14">[14]</ref> recent research into the novel's early reception and sales has indicated the contrary.<ref target="#cite_note-15">[15]</ref> One book review from the New York Times expressed a disappointment in the way the phantom was portrayed, saying that the feeling of suspense and horror is lost once it is found out that the phantom is just a man and not a real ghost.<ref target="#cite_note-New_York_Times_Book_Review-16">[16]</ref> The majority of the notability that the novel acquired early on was due to its publication in a series of installments in French, American, and English newspapers. This serialized version of the story became important when it was read and sought out by Universal Pictures to be adapted into a movie in 1925.<ref target="#cite_note-Peter_Haining-14">[14]</ref></p>
<p>Based on the critical reviews of two modern-day readers of the book, Sean Fitzpatrick and Cathleen Myers, the novel is praiseworthy for its drama, but overall it does not rise to the standards of great literature. Fitzpatrick claims that "The Phantom of the Opera is not a great book, but it is a great read."<ref target="#cite_note-Sean_Fitzpatrick-12">[12]</ref> He digresses that even though the book is not good enough to be in the canon of great literature, there are many aspects of it that make it fun to read such as the drama of the "whodunnit" plot, the investigative styling of the book which pretends to pull from real life newspaper articles and interviews relating to the Paris Opera House, and the character Erik (the phantom) who fills the roles of the "mad genius", disfigured monster, and one of three in a love triangle all at once. Fitzpatrick argues that all of these elements make the book good for light reading.<ref target="#cite_note-Sean_Fitzpatrick-12">[12]</ref> Myers agrees that the novel makes for a good "airplane read", but says that it fails in terms of being a good mystery novel. She claims that one of the book's downfalls is that one of the important characters - the mysterious Persian - is introduced too late in the storyline. Another glaring omission that she sees in the book is that the Phantom is left unexplained. Myers also criticizes Christine's love for Raoul whom she claims is an idiot, saying he "makes Jonathan Harker and Lord Godalming in Dracula look like rocket scientists."<ref target="#cite_note-Cathleen_Myers-11">[11]</ref></p>

<h2>Adaptations[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera&action=edit&section=10" title="Edit section: Adaptations">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Further information: <ref target="/wiki/Adaptations_of_The_Phantom_of_the_Opera" title="Adaptations of The Phantom of the Opera">Adaptations of The Phantom of the Opera</ref></p>
<p>There have been many literary and other dramatic works based on Leroux's novel, ranging from stage musicals to films to children's books. Some well known stage and screen adaptations of the novel are <ref target="/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_(1925_film)" title="The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)">the 1925 film</ref> and the <ref target="/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_(1986_musical)" title="The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)">Andrew Lloyd Webber musical</ref>. In Lloyd Webber's musical, he was focused on writing more of a romance piece and found the book and the musical took off from there. Leroux's novel was more than just a mystery and had romance and other genres, that would appeal to more audiences.<ref target="#cite_note-:12-4">[4]</ref> Lloyd Webber used accounts from within the novel in the musical as well such as the real-life event of the chandelier falling.<ref target="#cite_note-17">[17]</ref> This was first produced in the mid-80s and has continued to remain popular, still running on Broadway and the West End and spawning multiple touring productions. The musical has received more than fifty awards and is seen by many as being the most popular musical on Broadway.<ref target="#cite_note-:12-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>Leroux's novel was created into two silent films during the history and adaptations of the novel. The first production of the novel into a silent film was produced by German adaptation called, Das Gespenst im Opernhaus. This film though has no living proof left and is lost due to no pictures being taken or an actual copy of the film is preserved. The last living knowledge of the film is that it was made in 1916 and was directed by Ernest Matray.<ref target="#cite_note-:02-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>The next adaptation or silent film was made in 1925 by Universal Studios. This version starred <ref target="/wiki/Lon_Chaney" title="Lon Chaney">Lon Chaney Sr.</ref> as the phantom. Due to tensions on the set, there was a switch in directors and <ref target="/wiki/Edward_Sedgwick" title="Edward Sedgwick">Edward Sedgwick</ref> finished the film while changing the direction the movie was going to take. His take on the novel and making it a dark romantic movie with comedy wasn’t popular by audiences.<ref target="#cite_note-:02-3">[3]</ref> Finally, the film was adapted one last time by Maurice Pivar and Louis Weber where they took out most of Sedgwick's adaptation and stuck to the original film. This time, the movie was a success with audiences in 1925.<ref target="#cite_note-:02-3">[3]</ref></p>
