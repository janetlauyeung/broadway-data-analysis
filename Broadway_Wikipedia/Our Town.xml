<h3>Act I: Daily Life[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Our_Town&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Act I: Daily Life">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The Stage Manager introduces the audience to the small town of Grover's Corners, New Hampshire, and the people living there as a morning begins in the year 1901. Professor Willard speaks to the audience about the history of the town. Joe Crowell delivers the paper to Doc Gibbs, Howie Newsome delivers the milk, and the Webb and Gibbs households send their children (Emily and Wally are the Webbs, George is the Gibbs) off to school on this beautifully simple morning.</p>

<h3>Act II: Love and Marriage[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Our_Town&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Act II: Love and Marriage">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Three years have passed, and George and Emily prepare to wed. The day is filled with stress. Howie Newsome is delivering milk in the pouring rain while Si Crowell, younger brother of Joe, laments how George's baseball talents will be squandered. George pays an awkward visit to his soon-to-be in-laws. Here, the Stage Manager interrupts the scene and takes the audience back a year, to the end of Emily and George's junior year. Emily confronts George about his pride, and over an <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ice_cream_soda" title="Ice cream soda">ice cream soda</ref>, they discuss the future and they confess their love for each other. George decides not to go to college, as he had planned, but to work and eventually take over his uncle's farm. In the present, George and Emily say that they are not ready to marry—George to his mother, Emily to her father—but they both calm down and happily go through with the wedding.</p>

<h3>Act III: Death and Eternity[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Our_Town&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Act III: Death and Eternity">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Nine years have passed. The Stage Manager opens the act with a lengthy <ref target="/wiki/Monologue" title="Monologue">monologue</ref> emphasizing eternity, bringing the audience's attention to the cemetery outside of town and the characters who have died since the wedding, including Mrs. Gibbs (<ref target="/wiki/Pneumonia" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</ref>, while traveling), Wally Webb (burst appendix, while camping), Mrs. Soames, and Simon Stimson (suicide by hanging). Town undertaker Joe Stoddard is introduced, as is a young man named Sam Craig who has returned to Grover's Corners for his cousin's funeral. That cousin is Emily, who died giving birth to her and George's second child. Once the funeral ends, Emily emerges to join the dead; Mrs. Gibbs urges her to forget her life, warning her that being able to see but not interact with her family, all the while knowing what will happen in the future, will cause her too much pain, but she refuses. Ignoring the warnings of Simon, Mrs. Soames, and Mrs. Gibbs, Emily returns to Earth to relive one day, her 12th birthday. Emily watches with joy at being able to see her parents and some of the people of her childhood for the first time in years. However, her joy quickly turns to pain as she realizes how little people appreciate the simple joys of life. The memory proves too painful for her, and she realizes that every moment of life should be treasured. When she asks the Stage Manager if anyone truly understands the value of life while they live it, he responds, "No. The saints and poets, maybe—they do some." Emily returns to her grave next to Mrs. Gibbs and watches impassively as George kneels weeping over her. The Stage Manager concludes the play and wishes the audience a good night.</p>

<h2>Characters[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Our_Town&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</ref>]</h2>

<p>Stage Manager – a narrator, commentator, and guide through Grover's Corners. He joins in the action of the play periodically, as the minister at the wedding, the soda shop owner, a local townsman, etc., and speaks directly to Emily after her death.</p>

<h2>Composition[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Our_Town&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Composition">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Wilder wrote the play while in his 30s. In June 1937, he lived in the <ref target="/wiki/MacDowell_Colony" title="MacDowell Colony">MacDowell Colony</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/Peterborough,_New_Hampshire" title="Peterborough, New Hampshire">Peterborough, New Hampshire</ref>, one of the many locations where he worked on the play. It is believed Wilder drafted the entire third act during a visit to Zürich in September 1937, in one day, after a long evening walk in the rain with a friend, author <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phil_Andros" title="Phil Andros">Samuel Morris Steward</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-2">[2]</ref></p>

<h2>Setting[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Our_Town&action=edit&section=7" title="Edit section: Setting">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The play is set in the actual theatre where the play is being performed, but the year is always 1938. The Stage Manager of the 1938 production introduces the <ref target="/wiki/Story_within_a_story" title="Story within a story">play-within-the-play</ref> which is set in the fictional community of Grover's Corners, New Hampshire. The Stage Manager gives the coordinates of Grover's Corners as 42°40′ north latitude and 70°37′ west longitude (those coordinates are actually in Massachusetts, about a thousand feet off the coast of <ref target="/wiki/Rockport,_Massachusetts" title="Rockport, Massachusetts">Rockport</ref>).</p>

<h2>Style[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Our_Town&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: Style">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Wilder was dissatisfied with the theatre of his time: "I felt that something had gone wrong....I began to feel that the theatre was not only inadequate, it was evasive."<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> His response was to use a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Metatheatrical" title="Metatheatrical">metatheatrical</ref> style. Our Town's narrator, the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stage_Manager" title="Stage Manager">Stage Manager</ref>, is completely aware of his relationship with the audience, leaving him free to break the <ref target="/wiki/Fourth_wall" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</ref> and address them directly. According to the script, the play is to be performed with little <ref target="/wiki/Theatrical_scenery" title="Theatrical scenery">scenery</ref>, no <ref target="/wiki/Set_construction" title="Set construction">set</ref> and minimal <ref target="/wiki/Theatrical_property" title="Theatrical property">props</ref>. The characters mime the objects with which they interact. Their surroundings are created only with chairs, tables, staircases, and ladders. For example, the scene in which Emily helps George with his evening <ref target="/wiki/Homework" title="Homework">homework</ref>, conversing through upstairs windows, is performed with the two actors standing atop separate ladders to represent their neighboring houses. Wilder once said: "Our claim, our hope, our despair are in the mind—not in things, not in 'scenery.' "<ref target="#cite_note-lumley33-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>Wilder called Our Town his favorite out of all his works, but complained that it was rarely done right, insisting that it "should be performed without sentimentality or ponderousness--simply, dryly, and sincerely."[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>]</p>
