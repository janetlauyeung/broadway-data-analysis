<h2>Background[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Avenue_Q&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Background">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Avenue Q's cast consists of three human characters and eleven puppet characters who interact as if human, Sesame Street-style. The puppets are animated and voiced by puppeteers who are on stage, unconcealed. The puppet and human characters ignore the puppeteers, creating the illusion that the puppets are alive. To assist with the illusion, the puppeteers wear plain gray clothing in contrast to the human characters' colorful costumes. The same puppet may be operated by different puppeteers in different scenes, and the actor voicing the puppet may not be the one animating it. One puppeteer sometimes voices two or more puppets simultaneously. Conversely, the so-called "live-hands" puppets (see <ref target="/wiki/Avenue_Q#Puppets" title="Avenue Q">Puppets</ref>) require two puppeteers – again, in full view of the audience.</p>
<p>The show draws inspiration from and imitates the format of children's educational television shows Sesame Street and The Muppets. Marx interned at the program early in his career, and all four of the original cast's principal puppeteers—<ref target="/wiki/John_Tartaglia" title="John Tartaglia">John Tartaglia</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Stephanie_D%27Abruzzo" title="Stephanie D'Abruzzo">Stephanie D'Abruzzo</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Jennifer_Barnhart" title="Jennifer Barnhart">Jennifer Barnhart</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Rick_Lyon" title="Rick Lyon">Rick Lyon</ref>—were Sesame Street performers (D'Abruzzo returned to Sesame Street after leaving Avenue Q<ref target="#cite_note-6">[6]</ref>). Three of the puppet characters are direct recognizable parodies of Sesame Street puppets: Roommates <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rod_(Avenue_Q)" title="Rod (Avenue Q)">Rod</ref> and <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nicky_(Avenue_Q)" title="Nicky (Avenue Q)">Nicky</ref> are a riff on <ref target="/wiki/Bert_and_Ernie" title="Bert and Ernie">Bert and Ernie</ref>,<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> while <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trekkie_Monster" title="Trekkie Monster">Trekkie Monster</ref> bears the distinctive voice and disposition of <ref target="/wiki/Cookie_Monster" title="Cookie Monster">Cookie Monster</ref>, though not his obsession with baked goods. (The production officially disclaims any connection with either <ref target="/wiki/Sesame_Workshop" title="Sesame Workshop">Sesame Workshop</ref> or <ref target="/wiki/The_Jim_Henson_Company" title="The Jim Henson Company">The Jim Henson Company</ref>.)<ref target="#cite_note-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>All of the characters (puppet and human) are young adults who face real-world problems with uncertain solutions, as opposed to the simplistic problems and invariably happy resolutions encountered by characters on children's television programming. Much of the show's ironic humor emerges from its contrasts with Sesame Street, including the differences between innocent childhood experiences and complex adulthood. The storyline presupposes the existence of "monsters" and talking animals, and human actors sing, dance and interact with puppets, both human and non-human, as if they were sentient beings, in a light-hearted, quasi-fantasy environment. However, the characters use a considerable amount of profanity, and puppet nudity and sex are portrayed. The show addresses adult themes, such as racism, pornography, homosexuality and <ref target="/wiki/Schadenfreude" title="Schadenfreude">schadenfreude</ref>. </p>
<p>The story does not explain why seven of the human characters are portrayed by puppets while the other three human characters are played by humans. One character is a fictionalized version of the real-life celebrity <ref target="/wiki/Gary_Coleman" title="Gary Coleman">Gary Coleman</ref>, the juvenile actor who played <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arnold_Jackson_(character)" title="Arnold Jackson (character)">Arnold Jackson</ref> in the 1980s American sitcom <ref target="/wiki/Diff%27rent_Strokes" title="Diff'rent Strokes">Diff'rent Strokes</ref> and later famously sued his parents and business advisers for stealing his earnings.<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> Coleman is portrayed (by a woman in most productions) as an adult, who happens to be the building superintendent in the run-down Avenue Q neighborhood due to his dire financial situation. Marx and Lopez said that they originally intended to offer the Gary Coleman role to Coleman himself, and he expressed interest in accepting it, but did not show up for a meeting scheduled to discuss it. They stated that the character illustrates "one of the most important themes in Avenue Q ... that life isn't as easy as we've been led to believe".<ref target="#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> Coleman later threatened repeatedly to sue Avenue Q producers for their depiction of him, but ultimately he did not.<ref target="#cite_note-11">[11]</ref></p>
<p>When Coleman died on May 28, 2010, casts of both the Off-Broadway production in New York City and the second national tour in Dallas dedicated that evening's performances to his memory.<ref target="#cite_note-12">[12]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> The Coleman character remains in the show with modified dialogue.<ref target="#cite_note-14">[14]</ref></p>

<h2>Synopsis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Avenue_Q&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Synopsis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The show is set on a fictional street in an "outer-outer borough" of <ref target="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</ref>.</p>

<h3>Act I[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Avenue_Q&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Act I">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Princeton, a recent college graduate, is anxious to discover his purpose in life; but first, he must find an apartment and a job, with no work experience and an English degree ("What Do You Do with a B.A. in English?"). Beginning his search on Avenue A, he finally finds an affordable apartment on Avenue Q. His new neighbors are Kate Monster, a <ref target="/wiki/Kindergarten" title="Kindergarten">kindergarten</ref> assistant teacher; Rod, an <ref target="/wiki/Anal_retentiveness" title="Anal retentiveness">anal-retentive</ref> Republican banker; Nicky, Rod's <ref target="/wiki/Slacker" title="Slacker">slacker</ref> roommate; Brian, an aspiring comedian recently laid off from his day job; Christmas Eve, Brian's Japanese fiancée and a <ref target="/wiki/Therapy" title="Therapy">therapist</ref> with no clients; Trekkie Monster, a surly recluse who surfs the Internet all day in search of porn; and Gary Coleman, the building superintendent. Debates ensue over whose life sucks the most ("It Sucks to Be Me"), though they do conclude that Coleman's life sucks the most.</p>
<p>Nicky, who is straight, suspects that Rod is gay, and assures Rod it is okay with him if he is; but Rod insists he is not ("If You Were Gay"). Princeton finds a lucky penny and longs to discover his purpose in life ("Purpose"). Kate dreams of starting a "Monstersori" school for young "people of fur". Princeton innocently asks Kate if she and Trekkie are related, since they are both monsters, but Kate angrily pronounces his assumption racist. Princeton, taken aback, counters that Kate's Monstersori School would discriminate against non-monsters. They and the neighbors agree that racism is an adult reality ("Everyone's a Little Bit Racist").</p>
<p>Princeton receives money from his parents. The Bad Idea Bears, two charming troublemakers, convince him to spend it on beer. Kindergarten teacher Mrs. Thistletwat assigns Kate to teach the next morning's kindergarten class, her first solo teaching opportunity. She decides that her lesson will be about the Internet and all its educational attributes, but Trekkie Monster and the neighbors explain another reality of adulthood: Lots of adults, even "normal people", use it to find pornography ("The Internet is for Porn").</p>
<p>Princeton gives Kate a <ref target="/wiki/Mixtape" title="Mixtape">mixtape</ref>. His song selections are puzzling, making her wonder what message he is trying to send, but eventually, she decides that he must like her ("Mixtape"). Sure enough, he invites her on a date to the Around the Clock Café. Brian, the café's <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Master_of_Ceremonies" title="Master of Ceremonies">MC</ref>, does his raunchy stand-up act ("I'm Not Wearing Underwear Today"). He then introduces Lucy the Slut, a skanky chanteuse who wows the guys, especially Princeton, with a seductive cabaret number ("Special"). The Bad Idea Bears suggest that Kate and Princeton order some "harmless" <ref target="/wiki/Long_Island_Iced_Tea" title="Long Island Iced Tea">Long Island Iced Teas</ref>, and once Kate is totally inebriated, Princeton takes her home to bed.</p>
<p>Kate and Princeton have enthusiastic, high-decibel sex. Gary fields angry calls from other tenants but refuses to intercede ("You Can Be as Loud as the Hell You Want When You're Makin' Love"). Meanwhile, Rod hears Nicky say, "I love you, Rod," in his sleep, and is jubilant – but eventually realises it was he who was dreaming. Kate and Princeton profess their mutual love, and Princeton gives Kate his lucky penny ("Fantasies Come True").</p>
<p>The next morning, a hung-over Kate oversleeps and misses her teaching assignment. Mrs. Thistletwat berates her, and Kate angrily quits her job before she can be fired. Christmas Eve decides unilaterally that it is time she and Brian were married. At the wedding, Nicky blurts out his suspicion that Rod is gay. Rod, furious, insists he has a girlfriend named Alberta in Vancouver ("My Girlfriend Who Lives in Canada") and tells Nicky he is no longer welcome in their apartment.</p>
<p>When Kate catches Christmas Eve's wedding bouquet, Princeton panics, confesses a fear of commitment, and asks Kate if they can just be friends. Kate retorts that she already has plenty of friends, and breaks off their relationship ("There's a Fine, Fine Line").</p>

<h3>Act II[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Avenue_Q&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Act II">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>A despondent Princeton has been holed up in his apartment after breaking up with Kate but is coaxed out by the neighbors ("There is Life Outside Your Apartment"). Lucy is looking for a place to crash and seduces the rebounding Princeton. Kate is angry, but Christmas Eve explains that she would not be angry if she were not in love with him ("The More You Ruv Someone"). Kate writes a note to Princeton suggesting that they rendezvous at the <ref target="/wiki/Empire_State_Building" title="Empire State Building">Empire State Building</ref> and leaves it with Lucy who promptly destroys it. A homeless Nicky laments his fate to Gary who confesses that he is deriving pleasure from Nicky's misfortune ("<ref target="/wiki/Schadenfreude" title="Schadenfreude">Schadenfreude</ref>").</p>
<p>On the Empire State Building's viewing platform, Kate, thinking that Princeton has stood her up, throws his lucky penny away. A hundred stories below, Lucy, walking by on <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fifth_Avenue_(Manhattan)" title="Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)">Fifth Avenue</ref>, is knocked unconscious by the penny. Kate and Princeton unsuccessfully try to work out their problems over Lucy's comatose body. Rod is too proud to accept Nicky's repeated apologies, despite clearly missing him, and tearfully consults Christmas Eve. Princeton, Kate, and Nicky dream of returning to happier times ("I Wish I Could Go Back to College").</p>
<p>Princeton gives a still-homeless panhandling Nicky a quarter, and marvels at how fantastic he feels. Since thinking only about himself has gotten him nowhere, he decides to raise money to build Kate's Monstersori School. He solicits everyone, even breaking the <ref target="/wiki/Fourth_wall" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</ref> to shake down the audience, but results are disappointing ("The Money Song"). Then Trekkie Monster, recalling his own traumatic school experiences, donates ten million dollars – and explains to the astonished cast, "In volatile market, only stable investment is porn!" ("School for Monsters/The Money Song (Reprise)").</p>
<p>Kate joyfully opens her new school. Brian lands a consulting job, and Christmas Eve finally has a paying client (Rod), so the newlyweds move to a better neighborhood. Rod finally comes out, to no one's particular surprise, and takes Nicky back in. Nicky finds Rod a boyfriend – Ricky, a muscle-bound hunk who otherwise looks and sounds exactly like Nicky. The Bad Idea Bears discover <ref target="/wiki/Scientology" title="Scientology">Scientology</ref>. Lucy, recovered from her head injury, becomes a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Born-again_Christian" title="Born-again Christian">born-again Christian</ref> and takes a vow of chastity. Kate and Princeton agree to give their relationship another go ("There's a Fine, Fine Line (Reprise)").</p>
<p>A new college graduate inquires about the vacancy in the building, ("What Do You Do with a B.A. in English (Reprise)") and Princeton has an epiphany: maybe his purpose is to put everything he has learned into a Broadway musical. Everybody, especially the new guy, immediately ridicules him. The cast reminds Princeton that, in the real world, many people never find their purpose, but life goes on, and everything, both good and bad, is "only for now." ("For Now").</p>

<h3>Instrumentation[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Avenue_Q&action=edit&section=11" title="Edit section: Instrumentation">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The musical is scored for bass (acoustic and electric), drums/percussion (drum kit, bell tree, bongos, china cymbal, cowbell, egg shaker, finger cymbals, ice bell, mark tree, ratchet, siren whistle, slide whistle, tambourine, temple blocks, triangle, vibraslap, and wood block), guitars (acoustic, electric, and banjo), reeds (Bb clarinet, alto sax, flute), and two electronic keyboards.<ref target="#cite_note-21">[21]</ref></p>

<h3>Other Avenue Q songs[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Avenue_Q&action=edit&section=12" title="Edit section: Other Avenue Q songs">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Nine additional songs were written for Avenue Q or associated promotions, but are not part of the original Broadway production itself.</p>

<p>"Tear It Up and Throw It Away": Originally performed early in the first act, between "What Do You Do with a BA in English?" and "If You Were Gay"; Kate is called for <ref target="/wiki/Jury_duty" title="Jury duty">jury duty</ref>, and Nicky advises her to ignore the summons, pretending it was lost in the mail. ("Your civic duty? Who gives a doody?") Kate tears up the summons and is ticketed for littering. The number was cut during Off-Broadway rehearsals because it had no relevance to the plot, and because, according to Stephanie D'Abruzzo, there was no judicious way to dispose of the paper scraps, which remained onstage throughout Act One.<ref target="#cite_note-22">[22]</ref> The cut came so late that early promotional materials included references to the song, and its main melody can be heard underscoring dialog in "The Money Song" on the original cast recording. It was included on a CD that accompanied the original souvenir program but not on the cast recording. An original audio clip is available on <ref target="/wiki/YouTube" title="YouTube">YouTube</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-23">[23]</ref></p>
<p>"Time": Originally performed in a sequence where Nicky enjoys his time in the bathroom as Rod begs him to finish up so he can use the bathroom, and becomes increasingly distressed as the song continues. Eventually Rod decides to go use the Starbucks restroom, only for Nicky to hear him and ask to come with him.<ref target="#cite_note-24">[24]</ref> The song was cut during the development process but was resurrected for a video created for the London production. This video was originally shown on the on-stage video screens during intermission, just prior to the second act curtain; Nicky (<ref target="/wiki/Simon_Lipkin" title="Simon Lipkin">Simon Lipkin</ref>) sits on the toilet in the theatre's men's room at intermission, singing about all the "chores" he is getting done between acts. Several audience members waiting to use the stall become increasingly annoyed. British comedian <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Matt_Lucas_(comedian)" title="Matt Lucas (comedian)">Matt Lucas</ref> has a cameo role. The song was cut during early previews for unspecified reasons, but remained on the CD that accompanied the souvenir brochure, and was shown at the final West End performance on 30 October 2010. A video can be viewed on YouTube.<ref target="#cite_note-25">[25]</ref></p>
<p>"Rod's Dilemma": Written for Tony Award voters, this song spoofs Avenue Q's competition for the 2004 Tony for Best Musical, and the entire Tony voting process. In the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rotary_Club" title="Rotary Club">Rotary Club</ref> presidential election, Rod cannot decide whether to vote for the guy he has a crush on (symbolizing <ref target="/wiki/The_Boy_from_Oz" title="The Boy from Oz">The Boy from Oz</ref>), a wealthy man (<ref target="/wiki/Wicked_(musical)" title="Wicked (musical)">Wicked</ref>), or an old friend (<ref target="/wiki/Caroline,_or_Change" title="Caroline, or Change">Caroline, or Change</ref>). The neighbors advise him against voting "for your friends, 'cause they say you should vote for the candidate you think is good." The song was a part of the production's successful Tony Award campaign, called "Q '04 Now! Vote Your Heart!".<ref target="#cite_note-26">[26]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-27">[27]</ref> An audio cut is available on YouTube.<ref target="#cite_note-28">[28]</ref></p>
<p>"It Sucks To Be Me" (Reprise): This song is sung by Princeton immediately after Act Two begins. It was not part of the original show or original cast recording. The song was first added to the Las Vegas production, and subsequently became part of the current off-Broadway show and other unofficial productions.</p>
<p>"Only in Vegas": This parody of Las Vegas-style show tunes was written to promote the Las Vegas production. It featured Rick Lyon operating a <ref target="/wiki/Steve_Wynn" title="Steve Wynn">Steve Wynn</ref> puppet, who tells the cast of Avenue Q how happy they will be in Las Vegas. The song was performed on the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Regis_and_Kelly" title="Regis and Kelly">Regis and Kelly</ref> syndicated television show and in some press and media events.</p>
<p>"Rod's Christmas": Found on the CD Broadway's Greatest Gifts: Carols for a Cure, Vol. 5: Rod headlines at the "Don't Tell Daddy's Cabaret and Night Club" (a parody of the New York piano bar <ref class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Don%27t_tell_mama&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Don't tell mama (page does not exist)">Don't Tell Mama</ref>, which is named for a song from the musical <ref target="/wiki/Cabaret_(musical)" title="Cabaret (musical)">Cabaret</ref>). Rod sings that Christmas is the time of year where he can combine his two great loves, "Christmas carols and show tunes."</p>
<p>"The Holi-daze": Found on the CD Broadway's Greatest Gifts: Carols for a Cure, Vol. 8. Written by <ref target="/wiki/Michael_Patrick_Walker" title="Michael Patrick Walker">Michael Patrick Walker</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Phoebe_Kreutz" title="Phoebe Kreutz">Phoebe Kreutz</ref> (who both worked on the Broadway and Off-Broadway productions of Avenue Q), the members of the company sing about how they cope with the stresses and problems of the holiday season. The song does not feature any characters from the show but was recorded by several of the original Avenue Q cast and band members, and was sub-titled "Drinkin' Our Way Through The Holidays."</p>
<p>"Christmas": "Purpose" with new, festive lyrics. Written by the company of Avenue Q/London for Theatrecares' "West End Christmas" charity event. It is on a special CD, but can also be heard at <ref target="/wiki/Jon_Robyns" title="Jon Robyns">Jon Robyns</ref>'s Web site.<ref target="#cite_note-29">[29]</ref></p>
<p>"How Much Do the People in Your Neighborhood Make?": A parody on the classic Sesame Street song, "Who Are the People in Your Neighborhood", the song was written very early in the show's history, and dropped when the original television show format was abandoned in favor of a stage production.<ref target="#cite_note-aisle-30">[30]</ref></p>
<h2>Puppet development[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Avenue_Q&action=edit&section=13" title="Edit section: Puppet development">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The Avenue Q puppets, which cost up to $10,000 each, and require up to 120 hours of hand fabrication per character,<ref target="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</ref> were designed and built by original cast member Rick Lyon.<ref target="#cite_note-31">[31]</ref> Lyon's company, Lyon Puppets, continues to build and maintain the puppets used in all North American productions, and several of the international productions, including those from the UK, Australia, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, while supervising the construction of those from the Finnish and Swedish productions. Their unusually sturdy construction, with double-stitching, reinforced seams, steel boning, and custom fake fur and feathers, is necessitated by the rigors of an eight-shows-per-week performance schedule.</p>
<p>Three distinct types of puppets are used in the show:</p>

<h3>Rod puppets[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Avenue_Q&action=edit&section=14" title="Edit section: Rod puppets">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Single Rod: Princeton, Kate MonsterDouble Rod: Rod, Lucy, The Bad Idea Bears, Newcomer</p>
<p>Rod puppets consist of a head and a torso with two arms, at least one of which is movable for gestures. "Single rod" puppets have one movable arm controlled by one rod, with the other arm "posed" in a permanent gesture or attached to the puppet's torso; both arms are movable on "double rod" puppets, each controlled by a separate rod. The puppeteer controls the puppet's head and mouth with his or her dominant hand, and holds one or both rods in the other hand.<ref target="#cite_note-32">[32]</ref></p>

<h3>Live-hands puppets[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Avenue_Q&action=edit&section=15" title="Edit section: Live-hands puppets">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Nicky, Trekkie Monster, Mrs. Thistletwat, Ricky</p>
<p>Live-hands puppets require two puppeteers, each of whom contributes one hand and arm dressed with a long sleeve and glove matching the puppet's costume, which become the arms and hands of the puppet. The speaking puppeteer controls the puppet's left hand, head, and mouth, while the second, silent operator controls the right hand. (Sides are sometimes reversed if the speaking puppeteer is left-handed.) During the show, one puppeteer will sometimes leave to take over another puppet, leaving the live-hands puppet with a single operator and only one functioning hand. In a variation, one or both of the puppet's hands can be attached to its torso to permit operation by a single puppeteer.</p>

<h3>Special puppets[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Avenue_Q&action=edit&section=16" title="Edit section: Special puppets">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Mechanism: The Boxes</p>
<p>Free Hand: Ricky</p>
<p>Unlike other forms of puppetry, mechanized puppets are not directly controlled by the puppeteer's hand. Instead, they are controlled by a concealed trigger that when pulled causes the mouth to open. The motion is similar to a toy grabber. Princeton's cardboard boxes, also used in "Purpose", are examples of such puppets. Free hand puppets do not have rods, mechanisms, or live-hands for their arms. While their head controls are the same as a rod puppet, the hands are moved by physically picking them up and moving them. In the show Ricky is the only one like this because it is intended for use by a left handed puppeteer.</p>

<h2>History[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Avenue_Q&action=edit&section=17" title="Edit section: History">edit</ref>]</h2>
<ref target="/wiki/Jeff_Marx" title="Jeff Marx">Jeff Marx</ref> met <ref target="/wiki/Robert_Lopez" title="Robert Lopez">Robert Lopez</ref> at a songwriting class at the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/BMI_Workshop" title="BMI Workshop">BMI Workshop</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-33">[33]</ref> They became fascinated by puppets after they saw a puppeteer perform one in their class. For a part of the workshop the two decided to make a Muppet movie based on "<ref target="/wiki/Hamlet" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</ref>" called Kermit Prince of Denmark. Their show won a few awards but was ultimately turned down by the <ref target="/wiki/Jim_Henson" title="Jim Henson">Henson</ref> family. The duo then met <ref target="/wiki/Rick_Lyon" title="Rick Lyon">Rick Lyon</ref> after he performed <ref target="/wiki/Kermit_the_Frog" title="Kermit the Frog">Kermit</ref> in their class, and the three decided to make a new show about puppets making fun of Sesame Street. Lyon created puppets based on the Sesame Street muppets such as Princeton the Temp, Trekkie Monster (who at the time had a <ref target="/wiki/Star_Trek" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</ref> obsession, later changed to a porn obsession), and Nicky and Paul (Paul was later renamed Rod, and Princeton the Temp was shortened to Princeton).<ref target="#cite_note-34">[34]</ref> The show was originally conceived as a variety show for television, later modified to a three-episode faux variety show, and after finalization of its cast, to a theatrical production.<ref target="#cite_note-aisle-30">[30]</ref>

<p>Avenue Q opened on Broadway at the <ref target="/wiki/John_Golden_Theatre" title="John Golden Theatre">John Golden Theatre</ref> on July 31, 2003, following previews from July 10. The production was directed by <ref target="/wiki/Jason_Moore_(director)" title="Jason Moore (director)">Jason Moore</ref> and choreographed by Ken Roberson, with set design by Anna Louizos, costume design by Mirena Rada, lighting design by <ref target="/wiki/Howell_Binkley" title="Howell Binkley">Howell Binkley</ref>, musical supervision by <ref target="/wiki/Stephen_Oremus" title="Stephen Oremus">Stephen Oremus</ref>, musical direction by Gary Adler, and puppet design by Rick Lyon.

The show was nominated for six Tony Awards and won three, in the categories of Best Musical, Best Original Score, and Best Original Book.</p>
<p>After 22 previews and 2,534 regular performances, it closed on September 13, 2009.<ref target="#cite_note-closing-37">[37]</ref> As of June 21, 2009, the production had grossed over $117 million and had returned profits of $23.5 million to its investors.<ref target="#cite_note-closing-37">[37]</ref> (All of the money collected from the audience during "The Money Song" is donated to <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_Cares/Equity_Fights_AIDS" title="Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS">Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS</ref>.)</p>
<p>After the show closed on Broadway, it reopened Off-Broadway at the <ref target="/wiki/New_World_Stages" title="New World Stages">New World Stages</ref> complex on October 9, 2009.<ref target="#cite_note-38">[38]</ref> The show played its final performance off-Broadway on May 26, 2019.<ref target="#cite_note-:1-3">[3]</ref></p>

<h3>Las Vegas[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Avenue_Q&action=edit&section=21" title="Edit section: Las Vegas">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>In September 2005, Avenue Q opened at the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wynn_Hotel" title="Wynn Hotel">Wynn Hotel and Casino</ref> in Las Vegas under a production contract that precluded Avenue Q tours in North America during the Las Vegas run. A new 1,200 seat theater was built especially for the show. Variations from the Broadway production included a new reprise of "It Sucks to Be Me" for Princeton at the top of Act Two, some new orchestrations, a trimmed "The Money Song," and a new rock arrangement of "There Is Life Outside Your Apartment," as well as a few jokes written specifically for Las Vegas audiences.</p>
<p>Attendance was well below anticipated levels, due at least in part to the constant turnover of tourists in Las Vegas, which rendered the cultivation of word-of-mouth publicity virtually impossible. In mid-January 2006 the show was cut to 90 minutes and the intermission was removed. Hotel owner Steve Wynn promoted the show heavily, at one point decorating 20 city cabs in orange fuzz and large white "Q" letters. All such efforts were unsuccessful, and the show closed on May 28, 2006 after a nine-month run,<ref target="#cite_note-LATB021506-39">[39]</ref> terminating the exclusivity agreement and opening the way for national tours.</p>

<h3>West End[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Avenue_Q&action=edit&section=22" title="Edit section: West End">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>A <ref target="/wiki/Cameron_Mackintosh" title="Cameron Mackintosh">Cameron Mackintosh</ref>-produced version of Avenue Q premiered in 2006 in the <ref target="/wiki/West_End_theatre" title="West End theatre">West End</ref> at the <ref target="/wiki/No%C3%ABl_Coward_Theatre" title="Noël Coward Theatre">Noël Coward Theatre</ref> (formerly the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Albery_Theatre" title="Albery Theatre">Albery Theatre</ref>). Several adaptive changes were made for British audiences, including portrayal of the Gary Coleman character by a male actor. The production ran 1,179 performances through March 2009, then reopened in June 2009 at the <ref target="/wiki/Gielgud_Theatre" title="Gielgud Theatre">Gielgud Theatre</ref>. After a further 327 performances, the show moved in March 2010 to the <ref target="/wiki/Wyndham%27s_Theatre" title="Wyndham's Theatre">Wyndham's Theatre</ref>,<ref target="#cite_note-40">[40]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-41">[41]</ref> where it closed on October 30, 2010 after a five-year run.<ref target="#cite_note-42">[42]</ref></p>

<p>Avenue Q and <ref target="/wiki/Music_Theatre_International" title="Music Theatre International">Music Theatre International</ref> collaborated on the Avenue Q: School Edition to facilitate production of the musical by high school drama departments. Most of the profanity and sexual themes are removed from the script and score, and two songs ("My Girlfriend Who Lives in Canada" and "You Can Be As Loud as the Hell You Want") are removed. "The Internet Is for Porn" is replaced with "My Social Life Is Online", and Trekkie's obsession with pornography is replaced by an obsession with social networking sites. The characters Mrs. Thistletwat and Lucy the Slut are renamed Mrs. Butz and Lucy, respectively. The scenes involving the Bad Idea Bears are altered to deemphasize alcohol.<ref target="#cite_note-:3-5">[5]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-56">[56]</ref></p>

<p>In another <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_Cares/Equity_Fights_AIDS" title="Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS">Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS</ref> benefit in 2005, the original cast of Avenue Q and the cast of the Broadway revival of <ref target="/wiki/Fiddler_on_the_Roof" title="Fiddler on the Roof">Fiddler on the Roof</ref> presented a 10-minute spoof of both musicals called "Avenue Jew."<ref target="#cite_note-60">[60]</ref> As a brief prologue, Trekkie Monster poorly plays the Fiddler theme, pauses a moment, shrugs, and then eats the fiddle before running away. Tevye, his wife Golde, his two remaining daughters and the Fiddler, having immigrated to the US, arrive on Avenue Jew, an area inhabited by <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jewish" title="Jewish">Jewish</ref> versions of the Avenue Q characters. Kate Monster welcomes them and the family expresses disbelief that a puppet is talking to them. Tevye introduces himself and his family and finally realizes that the Fiddler is with them, so he chases him away. Later in the song "<ref target="/wiki/Tradition_(song)" title="Tradition (song)">The Puppets/The Humans</ref>," the humans are fed-up with the puppets upstaging them; Tevye and his family meet Brian and his wife "Hannukah Eve" when Jewish-American Princeton arrives, asking "What do you do with a B.A. in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yiddish_language" title="Yiddish language">Yiddish</ref>?" One of Tevye's daughter's, Shprintze, falls in love with Princeton, but Tevye forbids their union even though he likes Princeton. Princeton only says "I know, I know. <ref target="/wiki/If_I_Were_a_Rich_Man_(song)" title="If I Were a Rich Man (song)">If I were a human...</ref>". Rod begs the Matchmaker to find him a mate, and the Matchmaker, played by Mrs. Thistletwat, sets Rod up with Lazar Wolf ("I'm a lonely man, Tevye"). Shprintze tells her father that she and Princeton want to be married, and after a very brief interior monologue ("I'll be brief. On the other hand; on the other hand; tradition; ...sure, go ahead!"), Tevye finally consents to Princeton and Shprintze's marriage; they leave the stage to prepare for their wedding, much to Kate's horror - who insults Shprintze as she leaves. Rod and Lazar Wolf also wish to be wed, and ask permission from <ref target="/wiki/George_W._Bush" title="George W.

<p>In November 2005, the Avenue Q website held a "One Night Stand" contest for amateur puppeteers and their puppets.
