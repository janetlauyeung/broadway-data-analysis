<h3>Seattle premiere (2008)[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Shrek_The_Musical&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Seattle premiere (2008)">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The musical premiered in an out-of-town tryout at the <ref target="/wiki/5th_Avenue_Theatre" title="5th Avenue Theatre">5th Avenue Theatre</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/Seattle" title="Seattle">Seattle</ref>. Previews began August 14, 2008, with an opening night of September 10. The tryout ran through September 21, and played to generally favorable reviews, being cited as one of the few movie-to-stage adaptations "with heart".<ref target="#cite_note-Shrek_the_Musical-6">[6]</ref> The principal cast included <ref target="/wiki/Brian_d%27Arcy_James" title="Brian d'Arcy James">Brian d'Arcy James</ref> as Shrek, <ref target="/wiki/Sutton_Foster" title="Sutton Foster">Sutton Foster</ref> as Princess Fiona, <ref target="/wiki/Christopher_Sieber" title="Christopher Sieber">Christopher Sieber</ref> as Lord Farquaad, <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chester_Gregory_II" title="Chester Gregory II">Chester Gregory II</ref> as Donkey,<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/John_Tartaglia" title="John Tartaglia">John Tartaglia</ref> as Pinocchio and Kecia Lewis-Evans as the Dragon.</p>
<p>During previews, "I Could Get Used to This" was replaced by "Don't Let Me Go," and "Let Her In" became "Make a Move". Also during previews, a brief reprise of "Who I'd Be" was sung after Shrek overhears Fiona's misleading comment about being with a hideous beast, which led into "Build a Wall". This was cut and "Build a Wall" was placed after "Morning Person (Reprise)". "Build a Wall" was later cut during previews, but re-instated towards the end of the run.</p>

<h3>Broadway production (2008–10)[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Shrek_The_Musical&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Broadway production (2008–10)">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>After extensive changes were made, the show began previews on <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref> at the <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_Theatre_(53rd_Street)" title="Broadway Theatre (53rd Street)">Broadway Theatre</ref> on November 8, 2008, with the official opening on December 14. The cast included Brian d'Arcy James as Shrek, Sutton Foster as Fiona, Christopher Sieber as Farquaad and Tartaglia as Pinocchio. <ref target="/wiki/Daniel_Breaker" title="Daniel Breaker">Daniel Breaker</ref> took over the role of Donkey, as the creative team thought <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chester_Gregory_II" title="Chester Gregory II">Chester Gregory II</ref> did not fit the part.<ref target="#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> The Dragon was voiced by company members Haven Burton, Aymee Garcia and Rachel Stern, instead of a soloist. Kecia Lewis-Evans, who played Dragon in Seattle, was offered a part in the show's ensemble but declined.<ref target="#cite_note-Shrek_the_Musical-6">[6]</ref> Ben Crawford was the standby for Shrek, until he replaced d'Arcy James for the final months of performances.</p>
<p>The song "<ref target="/wiki/I%27m_a_Believer" title="I'm a Believer">I'm a Believer</ref>", which was originally played as the audience left the theatre, was added to the score on October 2, 2009, and sung by the entire company at the end of the performance.<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref></p>
<p>The Broadway production of the show received a total of twelve <ref target="/wiki/Drama_Desk_Award" title="Drama Desk Award">Drama Desk Award</ref> and eight <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Award" title="Tony Award">Tony Award</ref> nominations, including <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Musical" title="Tony Award for Best Musical">Best Musical</ref> and acting awards for d'Arcy James, Foster and Sieber. At the Tony Awards, the entire cast performed a section of "Freak Flag" for the opening number medley; later on, d'Arcy James, Foster and Breaker introduced Sieber and company, who performed "What's Up Duloc?". </p>
<p>The Broadway production closed on January 3, 2010, after 441 performances and 37 previews. At the time, it was one of the most expensive musicals to open on Broadway, at an estimated $25 million, and despite generally good reviews, it failed to recoup its initial investment.<ref target="#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> The show was then extremely modified for the national tour.</p>

<h2>Synopsis of the Broadway production[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Shrek_The_Musical&action=edit&section=9" title="Edit section: Synopsis of the Broadway production">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Act I[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Shrek_The_Musical&action=edit&section=10" title="Edit section: Act I">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Two ogre parents send their seven-year-old son Shrek out of their house and into the world to make his living. They warn him that because of his looks, he will be shunned by the world, and an angry mob will be the last thing he will see before he dies. Some years later, an embittered, grown up Shrek is living contentedly alone in a swamp. However, his solitude is disrupted when a refugee caravan of fairytale creatures show up on his property. They explain of their banishment from the Kingdom of Duloc, by order of the evil Lord Farquaad, who sentenced them into penal transportation for being freaks, under penalty of death if they ever return. Although hesitant, Shrek decides to travel to see Farquaad and try to regain his swamp, along with getting the Fairytale Creatures their homes back, with much encouragement from Pinocchio and the gang.</p>
<p>Along the way, Shrek rescues a talkative Donkey from some of Farquaad's guards. In return for rescuing him, and offering his friendship, Donkey insists on tagging along to show him the way to Duloc, which Shrek reluctantly agrees to, due to him being lost.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Duloc, Farquaad is torturing The Gingerbread Man into revealing the whereabouts of other Fairytale Creatures that are still hiding in his Kingdom so he can have them arrested as well. Just as Gingy was going to reveal what he knows, the Captain of the guards arrives and announces that they have found the Magic Mirror. Farquaad asked the mirror if Duloc was the most perfect kingdom of them all. The mirror told him that he's not truly a king yet, but he can become one if he marries a princess. For this episode of "This Is Your Wife" (a parody of The Dating Game), the mirror introduces three different princesses for Lord Farquaad to choose from: Cinderella, Snow White, and Princess Fiona; at the suggestion from his henchman, Thelonious, Farquaad chooses Princess Fiona, who is currently trapped in a castle surrounded by lava and guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Accepting this as a task, Farquaad decides to marry her to become king, and rushes out to plan a raffle to see which knight would be worthy enough to embark on a quest to retrieve Fiona before the Mirror can tell him what happens to her at night. The Mirror then shows the audience the story of Fiona's childhood.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old Fiona dreams of the brave knight who, as her storybooks tell her, will one day rescue her from her tower and end her mysterious curse with "True Love's First Kiss". As she grows into a teenager, and then a headstrong woman, she becomes a little bit stir-crazy, but she never loses her faith in her fairytales.</p>
<p>Shrek and Donkey arrive in Duloc where Farquaad expresses his love for his kingdom, accompanied by his cheerful cookie-cut army of Duloc Dancers. They approach Farquaad, with him being impressed by Shrek's size and appearance. Farquaad demands that Shrek must rescue Fiona, and in return, he will give Shrek the deed to his swamp.</p>
<p>The two unlikely friends set off to find Fiona, with Shrek becoming increasingly annoyed with Donkey as time progresses. After crossing the rickety old bridge and arriving at the castle, Shrek sets off alone to rescue Fiona while Donkey encounters Dragon who initially wants to eat him, but then decides to spare him by keeping him for her own good after Donkey manages to charm her. When Shrek finds Fiona, his lack of interest in playing out her desired, romantic rescue scene annoys her, and he drags her off by force. The two of them reunite with Donkey, and all three attempt to escape while being chased by the angry Dragon. Shrek traps Dragon and they get to a safe point.</p>
<p>Fiona then insists that Shrek reveal his identity and is shocked that her rescuer is an ogre and not the Prince Charming her stories indicated. Shrek explains that he is merely her champion; instead, she is to marry Farquaad. The trio begin their journey back to Duloc, but Fiona becomes apprehensive as the sun begins to set. She insists that they rest for the night and that she spend the night alone in a nearby cave. Donkey and Shrek remain awake, with Donkey asking Shrek who he would be, if he did not have to be an ogre anymore. As Shrek opens up to Donkey on who he would wish to be, Fiona transforms into an ogress as part of her curse that happens during sunset, stands apart, alone, and listens.</p>

<p>The next day, Princess Fiona rises early and sings with a bluebird and dances with a deer (before making the bird explode and throwing the deer off a cliff). She assists the <ref target="/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin" title="Pied Piper of Hamelin">Pied Piper</ref> in his rat-charming duties ("Morning Person"). Shrek brings down her mood by attempting to give subtle hints about her groom-to-be ("Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply", "He's very good at small talk", etc.) and mocking her tragic childhood circumstances. The two begin a contest of trying to one-up each other to outdo the others' backstory, but end up revealing their respective pasts ("I Think I Got You Beat"). Both admit to being thrown out by their parents; this connection, as well as bonding over a love of disgusting bodily noises, kindles friendship. </p>
<p>Back in Duloc, Lord Farquaad was in his bathtub planning his wedding, and he reveals his own sordid heritage after The Magic Mirror insists that Farquaad should invite his father, but Farquaad refuses, explaining how he abandoned him in the woods as a child ("The Ballad of Farquaad").</p>
<p>As Shrek and Fiona's newfound camaraderie grows into love, Donkey insists, with the help of the <ref target="/wiki/Three_Blind_Mice" title="Three Blind Mice">Three Blind Mice</ref> from his imagination, that Shrek should gather his courage and romantically engage Fiona ("Make a Move"). Shrek, finally beginning to come out of his caustic, protective shell, tries to find the words to explain his feelings to Fiona ("When Words Fail").</p>
<p>While Shrek is out finding a flower for Fiona, Donkey discovers that Fiona turns into an ogress at night, and she confesses that she was cursed as a child, which is why she was locked away in the tower. Only a kiss from her true love will return her to her proper form, and she asks Donkey to promise never to tell. Shrek arrives near the end of the conversation and misunderstands Fiona's description of herself as an ugly beast, and thinks she is talking about him. Hurt by her presumed opinion, Shrek storms off.</p>
<p>The next day, transformed back to her human form, Fiona decides to tell Shrek about her curse ("Morning Person (Reprise)"). When she tries to explain, Shrek rebuffs her with his "ugly beast" overhearing, causing Fiona in turn to misunderstand. Then Farquaad arrives to claim Fiona and tells Shrek he has cleared the swamp of the Fairytale Creatures, and now belongs to Shrek again. While not very impressed with Farquaad, Fiona agrees to marry him and insists that they have the wedding before sunset. As Farquaad and Fiona ride back to Duloc, Donkey tries to explain the misunderstanding to Shrek (who is too angry and upset to listen), and Shrek rejects him as well, declaring that he will return to his swamp alone and build a wall to shield himself from the world ("Build a Wall").</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Fairytale Creatures are on their way to a landfill which is to be their new home, since they were forced to relocate from the swamp. After dealing with the fact that Shrek broke his promise to them, however, Gingy rants that Farquaad's treatment of them is intolerable; just because they are freaks does not mean they deserve to be hated, so he rallies most of the other fairytale creatures into staging a <ref target="/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat" title="Coup d'état">coup d'état</ref> against Farquaad's rule. Unfortunately, a bitter Pinocchio (remembering they are not allowed back to Duloc), doesn't want his friends to get killed, suggesting they should just keep going, and wait until everything gets better, all the while, wishing to be a real boy. Exasperated by Pinocchio's turndown, Gingy convinces him to join the protest, inspiring him to accept who he is, as all of them have accepted who they are; they gather new confidence and strength in themselves, as they declare that they'll raise their "Freak Flag" high against their tormentors ("Freak Flag"). Now realizing that they have become something more than friends, and have become a family, Pinocchio now leads his gang back to Duloc to overthrow Farquaad once and for all.</p>
<p>Shrek has returned to his once again private swamp, but he misses Fiona. Donkey shows up attempting to seal off his half of the swamp with stone boulders, which Shrek rebuffs. In turn, Donkey angrily berates Shrek for his reclusive and stubborn habits, even to the point of driving off Fiona. An angered Shrek reveals he heard her talking about a hideous creature the night before, and Donkey retorts that they were not talking about him, but of "someone else". When a confused Shrek inquires who it was, Donkey, wanting to keep his promise, and still cross with Shrek, refuses to talk. When Shrek apologizes and extends his friendship, Donkey forgives him. The two then go back to Duloc, where Shrek objects to this marriage before Farquaad can kiss Fiona, and Fiona convinces him to let Shrek speak with her. Shrek finally finds the words to express his feelings for Fiona, and he declares his love for her ("Big Bright Beautiful World (Reprise)"). However, his declaration of love is mocked by Farquaad. Caught between love and her desire to break the curse, Fiona tries to escape the event. Just then, the Fairytale Creatures storm into the wedding and protest their banishment. They are accompanied by <ref target="/wiki/Seven_Dwarfs" title="Seven Dwarfs">Grumpy</ref>, one of the <ref target="/wiki/Seven_Dwarfs" title="Seven Dwarfs">Seven Dwarfs</ref>, who reveals that he is Farquaad's father. He thinks that his invitation got lost in the mail, and he kicked Farquaad out at the age of 28 when he wouldn't move out of the basement, revealing Farquaad is a freak as well. During the scuffle, the sun sets, causing Fiona to turn into an ogress in front of everyone. Farquaad, furious and disgusted over the change, orders for Shrek to be <ref target="/wiki/Hanged,_drawn_and_quartered" title="Hanged, drawn and quartered">drawn and quartered</ref> along with the Fairytale Creatures and Fiona banished back to her tower. As Farquaad proclaims himself the new King, Shrek whistles for the Dragon, who has now escaped the castle (and is the reason Shrek and Donkey got to the wedding just in time). Dragon then crashes through the window with Donkey and incinerates Farquaad with her fiery breath.</p>
<p>With Farquaad dead, Shrek and Fiona admit their love for each other and share true love's first kiss. Fiona's curse is broken, and she takes her true form: an ogress. At first, she is ashamed of her looks, but Shrek declares that she is still beautiful. The two ogres begin a new life together (along with Donkey, Dragon, and the Fairytale Creatures) as everyone celebrates their liberation against Farquaad's rule ("This Is Our Story"). In the end, Shrek and Fiona (in association with Donkey and Dragon) host their post-wedding party ("I'm A Believer").</p>

<ref target="/wiki/Puss_in_Boots_(Shrek)" title="Puss in Boots (Shrek)">Puss in Boots</ref> makes a silent <ref target="/wiki/Cameo_appearance" title="Cameo appearance">cameo appearance</ref> during the "Travel Song". He tips his hat to Shrek and Donkey and walks away. Later, a bunny screams after Shrek calls him delicious. <ref target="/wiki/Hey_Diddle_Diddle" title="Hey Diddle Diddle">A cow jumps over the moon, and a dish runs away with a spoon</ref>, while being pursued by the police. Shrek and Donkey later see a giraffe and gazelles which look like the gazelle wheel in <ref target="/wiki/The_Lion_King_(musical)" title="The Lion King (musical)">The Lion King</ref> (an excerpt from "<ref target="/wiki/Circle_of_Life" title="Circle of Life">Circle of Life</ref>" plays during this part of the song).
<p>As with the 2001 film, Shrek ends the song "Travel Song" with "That'll do, Donkey, that'll do"; this is a reference to the similar phrase in the film <ref target="/wiki/Babe_(film)" title="Babe (film)">Babe</ref>, in which Hoggett reassures "That'll do, Pig. That'll do."</p>
<p>King Harold and Queen Lillian originally sang a part during "Big Bright Beautiful World," explaining to Young Fiona that all ogres are monsters unloved by everyone. Now they walk past Young Shrek, taking Young Fiona with them. She waves at Shrek, but they lead her away (the guards preceding them give the impression that they are taking Fiona to her tower). This was later cut out of the Broadway production. A similar part was re-introduced for the national tour and London productions.</p>
<p>In "I Know It's Today" and "This is How A Dream Comes True," Fiona sings "Are you there, God, it's me, Fiona?" which is similar to the book entitled "<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Are_You_There,_God%3F_It%27s_Me,_Margaret" title="Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret">Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret</ref>" by <ref target="/wiki/Judy_Blume" title="Judy Blume">Judy Blume</ref>.</p>
<p>In "Morning Person," much of the part where Fiona dances with the mice is reminiscent of the nightclub scene in Bob Fosse's "Sweet Charity."</p>
<p>Most of the spoken lines are taken from the first film, including the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Muffin_Man" title="Muffin Man">Muffin Man</ref> scene between Farquaad and Gingy, and Fiona explaining the curse to Donkey.</p>
<p>"Welcome to Duloc" is the only original song from the film sung in the musical. It is now "What’s Up, Duloc" and is sung by the Duloc Dancers, who resemble the puppets that sing it in the film.</p>
<p>Originally the orchestra played "I'm a Believer" after the curtain call, but as of October 2, 2009, it is sung by the entire company at the end of the performance.</p>
<p>At the end of "What's up, Duloc?" (Reprise), Lord Farquaad references <ref target="/wiki/Defying_Gravity_(song)" title="Defying Gravity (song)">Defying Gravity</ref> from the Broadway musical <ref target="/wiki/Wicked_(musical)" title="Wicked (musical)">Wicked</ref>, when he sings "...and no ones gonna bring me down!" followed by the famous ending note. Also, the oft-repeated line 'Hey-nonny-nonny-nonny-no' is taken from the song "Shy" from <ref target="/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Mattress" title="Once Upon a Mattress">Once Upon a Mattress</ref>.</p>
<p>At the end of "Forever", the Dragon's final line is a reference to the <ref target="/wiki/Dreamgirls" title="Dreamgirls">Dreamgirls</ref> song "<ref target="/wiki/And_I_Am_Telling_You_I%27m_Not_Going" title="And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going">And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going</ref>". In some adaptations of this song in later productions, the Dragon performer appears alongside the puppet (in previous performances, the performer sang off-stage.)</p>
<ref target="/wiki/Julie_Andrews" title="Julie Andrews">Julie Andrews</ref>, who played Queen Lillian in <ref target="/wiki/Shrek_2" title="Shrek 2">Shrek 2</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Shrek_the_Third" title="Shrek the Third">Shrek the Third</ref>, and <ref target="/wiki/Shrek_Forever_After" title="Shrek Forever After">Shrek Forever After</ref>, provides the voice for the audio instructions before each performance that reminds the audience to turn off their cell phones, the use of recording devices is forbidden, etc. and "if you refuse, a terrifying ogre will leap from the stage, lift you from your seat, and drag you far, far away."
<p>During "Story of My Life", one of the show's musical numbers, Mama Bear sings "Mama's in the mud, Mama's in distress," which is a nod to the song "<ref target="/wiki/Rose%27s_Turn" title="Rose's Turn">Rose's Turn</ref>" from the musical <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gypsy:_A_Musical_Fable" title="Gypsy: A Musical Fable">Gypsy</ref>.</p>
<p>During "Freak Flag" a flag is waved around with a face on it, which resembles the famous logo of young <ref target="/wiki/Cosette" title="Cosette">Cosette</ref> from <ref target="/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables_(musical)" title="Les Misérables (musical)">Les Misérables</ref> which is accompanied by a dance similar to "<ref target="/wiki/Do_You_Hear_the_People_Sing%3F" title="Do You Hear the People Sing?">Do you hear the people sing</ref>?".</p>
<p>During a part of "Don't Let Me Go" on the national tour, Donkey sings to the music of "<ref target="/wiki/Take_Me_or_Leave_Me" title="Take Me or Leave Me">Take Me or Leave Me</ref>" and "I'll Cover You" from <ref target="/wiki/Rent_(musical)" title="Rent (musical)">Rent</ref>. He also makes a reference to "La Vie Boheme" from the same musical while chanting things and marching across the stage in the bridge of the song.</p>
<p>During "What's Up, Duloc?," the ensemble reference the musical <ref target="/wiki/Chicago_(musical)" title="Chicago (musical)">Chicago</ref>.</p>
<p>During a part of "Don't Let Me Go" original Broadway recording, Donkey makes reference to "Part Of Your World" from <ref target="/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(1989_film)" title="The Little Mermaid (1989 film)">Little Mermaid</ref>.</p>
<p>Donkey sings to Shrek "Don't speak, don't speak, don't speak," referencing Dianne Wiest and John Cusack in "Bullets Over Broadway."</p>
<p>The opening of "Who I'd Be" is reminiscent of "<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bring_Him_Home_(Les_Mis%C3%A9rables)" title="Bring Him Home (Les Misérables)">Bring Him Home</ref>" from '<ref target="/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables_(musical)" title="Les Misérables (musical)">Les Misérables</ref>.</p>

<h2>Reception[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Shrek_The_Musical&action=edit&section=19" title="Edit section: Reception">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The musical has received mixed to positive reviews from critics. <ref target="/wiki/Ben_Brantley" title="Ben Brantley">Ben Brantley</ref> wrote in <ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref>: "'Shrek,' for the record, is not bad.... As the title character, a misanthropic green ogre who learns to love, the talented Mr. James is... encumbered with padding and prosthetics.... As the evil, psychologically maimed Lord Farquaad, the very droll Christopher Sieber is required to walk on his knees, with tiny fake legs dangling before him — an initially funny sight gag that soon drags". He praises Sutton Foster as "an inspired, take-charge musical comedian.... Ms. Foster manages both to make fun of and exult in classical musical-comedy moves while creating a real, full character at the same time."<ref target="#cite_note-37">[37]</ref></p>
<ref target="/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</ref> noted that the production had a reported budget of $24 million. Any "theme-park cutesiness is offset by the mischievous humor in David Lindsay-Abaire's book and lyrics. The production's real achievement, however, is that the busy visuals and gargantuan set-pieces never overwhelm the personalities of the actors or their characters. The ensemble is talented and the four leads, in particular, couldn't be better."<ref target="#cite_note-38">[38]</ref>
<p>The <ref target="/wiki/Associated_Press" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</ref> said that "the folks at <ref target="/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation" title="DreamWorks Animation">DreamWorks</ref> have done their darndest to make sure we are entertained at Shrek the Musical, the company's lavish stage adaptation of its hit animated movie. For much of the time, they succeed, thanks to the talent and ingratiating appeal of the show's four principal performers. The show's massive sets and colorful costumes (both courtesy of Tim Hatley) are so visually eye-catching that they often distract from what's going on with the story and score. Composer Jeanine Tesori has written attractive, eclectic, pop-flavored melodies that range from a jaunty 'Travel Song' to a gutsy duet called 'I Got You Beat' for Shrek and Fiona that revels in rude noises." The review also noted that Lindsay-Abaire's lyrics are often fun and quite witty.<ref target="#cite_note-39">[39]</ref></p>
<ref target="/wiki/USA_Today" title="USA Today">USA Today</ref> gave the show three and a half stars out of four, writing: "Shrek, which draws from William Steig's book about a lovable ogre and the DreamWorks animated movie that it inspired, is nonetheless a triumph of comic imagination with a heart as big and warm as Santa's. It is the most ingeniously wacky, transcendently tasteless Broadway musical since <ref target="/wiki/The_Producers_(musical)" title="The Producers (musical)">The Producers</ref>, and more family-friendly than that gag-fest." The review also noted, however, that "Like other musical adaptations of hit films, Shrek... leans heavily on winking satire. There are the usual nods to more fully realized shows, from <ref target="/wiki/Gypsy_(musical)" title="Gypsy (musical)">Gypsy</ref> to <ref target="/wiki/A_Chorus_Line" title="A Chorus Line">A Chorus Line</ref>, and Jeanine Tesori's blandly ingratiating score doesn't feature any songs you're likely to be humming 20 years from now."<ref target="#cite_note-40">[40]</ref>
