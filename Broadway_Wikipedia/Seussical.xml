The musical's name is a portmanteau of "Seuss" and "musical". Following its Broadway debut in 2000, the show was widely panned by critics, and closed in 2001 with heavy financial losses. It has spawned two US national tours and a West End production, and has become a frequent production for schools and regional theatres.</p>

<h2>Plot[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Seussical&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Plot">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>This synopsis describes the tour version of the show, currently being licensed as "Seussical the Musical" by <ref target="/wiki/Music_Theatre_International" title="Music Theatre International">Music Theatre International (MTI)</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-SeussicalIP-1">[1]</ref></p>

<h3>Act I[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Seussical&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Act I">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The show opens on a bare stage, save for an odd red-and-white-striped hat in the center. A small boy wanders into view and notices the hat, wondering to whom it might belong. He finally mentions <ref target="/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat" title="The Cat in the Hat">the Cat in the Hat</ref>, who appears before the Boy and tells him he has been brought to life by the Boy's "<ref target="/wiki/Oh,_the_Thinks_You_Can_Think!" title="Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!">Thinks</ref>". The Cat creates the "Seussian" world and characters around the boy and himself ("Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!"), then reveals he is about to tell a story about someone as imaginative as the Boy is.</p>
<p>To begin the story, the Cat encourages the Boy to think up the Jungle of Nool, where Horton the Elephant is bathing. Horton <ref target="/wiki/Horton_Hears_a_Who!" title="Horton Hears a Who!">hears a strange noise coming from a nearby speck of dust</ref>, and reasons that someone must be on it, calling out for help. He carefully places the speck on a soft clover and decides to guard it ("Horton Hears a Who"), but is mocked mercilessly by the Sour Kangaroo and the other animals of the jungle, who do not believe him ("Biggest Blame Fool"). The only exceptions are Horton's bird neighbors, Gertrude McFuzz, who admires his compassion, and Mayzie LaBird, who is more concerned about herself.</p>
<p>Horton soon discovers that the speck is actually a microscopic planet populated by creatures called Whos. The citizens of Who-ville introduce themselves and their <ref target="/wiki/How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas!" title="How the Grinch Stole Christmas!">yearly Christmas pageant directed by their friend the Grinch</ref>, but also reveal that in addition to being unable to control where the speck flies, they are on the brink of war and <ref target="/wiki/The_Lorax" title="The Lorax">their entire population of Truffula Trees has been cut down</ref> ("Here on Who"). The Whos thank Horton and ask for his protection, and he agrees to guard their planet.</p>
<p>At this point, the Cat pushes the Boy into the story; he becomes Jojo, the son of the Mayor of Who-ville and his wife. Jojo has been getting into trouble at school for having Thinks, so his parents order him to "take a bath and go to bed, and think some normal Thinks, instead."<ref target="#cite_note-SeussicalIP-1">[1]</ref> Jojo blames the Cat for getting him into trouble and tries to send him away. The Cat refuses and persuades Jojo to imagine the tub is <ref target="/wiki/McElligot%27s_Pool" title="McElligot's Pool">McElligot's Pool</ref> ("It's Possible"). Jojo inadvertently floods the house, leading the Mayor and his wife to contemplate what to do with their son ("How to Raise a Child"). When the Cat hands them a brochure, they decide to send Jojo to a military school run by General Genghis Khan Schmitz, who is preparing to go to war with <ref target="/wiki/The_Butter_Battle_Book" title="The Butter Battle Book">those who eat their bread with the butter side down</ref> ("The Military"). While there, Jojo meets Horton, and finds a mutual friend in him ("Alone in the Universe").</p>
<p>Gertrude, meanwhile, has fallen in love with Horton, but is afraid he does not notice her because of her own tail, which consists of <ref target="/wiki/Yertle_the_Turtle_and_Other_Stories" title="Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories">only "one droopy-droop feather"</ref> ("The One Feather Tail of Miss Gertrude McFuzz"). At the advice of Mayzie, whose tail is enormous and dazzling, she consumes pills which make her tail grow new feathers. Gertrude is so excited that she overdoses, causing her tail to grow long and unwieldy ("Amayzing Mayzie"/"Amazing Gertrude").</p>
<p>Horton is ambushed by the Wickersham brothers, a gang of delinquent monkeys, who steal the clover and make off with it ("Monkey Around"). Horton gives chase until the Wickershams hand the clover to an eagle named Vlad Vladikoff, who drops it into a large patch of identical clovers ("Chasing the Whos"). Here, the Cat cuts briefly into the action to remind the audience <ref target="/wiki/Did_I_Ever_Tell_You_How_Lucky_You_Are%3F" title="Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are?">how lucky they are</ref> to not be Horton ("How Lucky You Are"). Undeterred, Horton begins to look for the clover, hoping the Whos are still alive, when Gertrude catches up with him and tries to get him to notice her new tail. Horton is too busy, so she leaves to take more pills ("Notice Me, Horton").</p>
<p>Horton is about to search his three millionth clover when he loses hope. Mayzie, sitting in a nearby tree, offers to help him forget about the Whos by <ref target="/wiki/Horton_Hatches_the_Egg" title="Horton Hatches the Egg">hatching an egg</ref> that she is too lazy to care for ("How Lucky You Are (Reprise)"). Horton reluctantly agrees, and Mayzie leaves for a vacation. Horton sits through months of harsh weather as he tries to decide between the egg and the Whos ("Horton Sits on the Egg") before he is captured by hunters, who take him away along with the entire tree. Gertrude tries to stop the hunters, but cannot fly due to her heavy tail.</p>
<p>The Cat closes the act with a reprise of "How Lucky You Are", and conducts the band during the intermission.</p>

<h3>Act II[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Seussical&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Act II">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Horton, still hatching the egg, is auctioned off to the traveling <ref target="/wiki/If_I_Ran_the_Circus" title="If I Ran the Circus">Circus McGurkus</ref> ("Egg, Nest, and Tree"/"Circus McGurkus"/"How Lucky You Are (Reprise)"). At one show in Palm Beach, he meets up with Mayzie, who insists that he keep the egg for himself before leaving ("Amayzing Horton"). Horton mourns the loss of the Whos and Jojo, but vows just as surely to protect the egg, as it, too, is alone without its mother ("Alone in the Universe (Reprise)"), and sings it a lullaby about a magical place called <ref target="/wiki/I_Had_Trouble_in_Getting_to_Solla_Sollew" title="I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew">Solla Sollew</ref>. At the same time, the Mayor and his wife begin to miss Horton and Jojo, and wish for Solla Sollew, as well ("Solla Sollew").</p>
<p>Jojo is with General Schmitz and his platoon as the Butter Battle commences. Jojo deserts Schmitz, but sprints into a minefield and vanishes in an explosion. Schmitz assumes the worst and heads to Who-ville to tell Jojo's parents that their son has died.The Cat returns to perform a re-enactment of the dramatic scene. But in reality, Jojo has survived, but is lost with no idea of where to turn. The Cat appears to him with a band of <ref target="/wiki/Hunches_in_Bunches" title="Hunches in Bunches">Hunches</ref>, encouraging him to use his Thinks to find his way home ("Havin' a Hunch"). Jojo does so and happily reunites with his parents, who forgive him for his Thinks.</p>
<p>Gertrude sneaks into the circus to free Horton, explaining she plucked out all but one of her tail feathers to fly there, and confesses her love for him. She also reveals she has found his clover, delighting and relieving Horton to find the Whos alive and well ("All For You"). However, the Sour Kangaroo and the Wickersham brothers arrive to take Horton back to the jungle.</p>
<p>In the jungle, Horton is put on trial for the crimes of "talking to a speck, disturbing the peace, and loitering... on an egg" <ref target="#cite_note-SeussicalIP-1">[1]</ref> ("The People Versus Horton the Elephant"). Aided by Gertrude, Horton makes his best case, but Judge Yertle the Turtle finds him guilty. He orders Horton remanded to the "Nool Asylum for the Criminally Insane" and the clover destroyed in a kettle of hot "Beezle-Nut" oil.<ref target="#cite_note-SeussicalIP-1">[1]</ref> Desperate, Horton encourages the Whos to make as much noise as possible to prove their existence, but the animals do not hear them. Jojo finally uses his Thinks to conjure a new word, "Yopp", which he shouts loudly enough to reach the animals' ears. Convinced at last, the animals repent and promise to help protect the Whos, and Horton is acquitted. Jojo is accepted by his parents and the rest of Who-ville as "Thinker Non-Stop" for saving their planet. Horton's egg hatches into a tiny flying "Elephant-Bird", amazing everyone, but dismaying Horton, who panics at the thought of flying progeny. Gertrude reassures him that they can raise the child together, and they agree to do so.</p>
<p>With the story finished, the Cat returns to close the show ("Finale"/"Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!"), then vanishes along with the scenery, leaving his hat and Jojo, who is now the Boy again. The Boy picks the hat up, dons it, and says, "Seuss!"</p>
<p>During a curtain call, the company performs a number based on <ref target="/wiki/Green_Eggs_and_Ham" title="Green Eggs and Ham">Green Eggs and Ham</ref> ("Green Eggs and Ham").</p>

<p>An extensive sequence adapting <ref target="/wiki/The_Lorax" title="The Lorax">The Lorax</ref> was seen in the original script, which involved Jojo meeting the Once-ler after deserting the army, and receiving the last Truffula Tree seed from him, giving him the courage to save Who-ville. Relevant characters included the Lorax himself as well as Bar-ba-loots, Swomee-Swans, and Humming-Fish, who would all appear and disappear as the Once-ler told his story. The sequence faced numerous difficulties due to the show's already lengthy running time, and was ultimately cut entirely after its Boston tryout. As of 2013, MTI has begun offering the sequence as an independent "mini-musical", advertising it on the back of Seussical librettos and scripts.</p>

<p>Seussical opened on Broadway at the <ref target="/wiki/Richard_Rodgers_Theatre" title="Richard Rodgers Theatre">Richard Rodgers Theatre</ref> on November 30, 2000.<ref target="#cite_note-ibdb-9">[5]</ref> </p>
<p>It was directed by <ref target="/wiki/Frank_Galati" title="Frank Galati">Frank Galati</ref> and choreographed by <ref target="/wiki/Kathleen_Marshall" title="Kathleen Marshall">Kathleen Marshall</ref>. Marshall's brother <ref target="/wiki/Rob_Marshall" title="Rob Marshall">Rob Marshall</ref> was hired to direct the show when it returned to Broadway from Boston, though was uncredited. <ref target="/wiki/David_Shiner_(clown)" title="David Shiner (clown)">David Shiner</ref> played the Cat in the Hat, while <ref target="/wiki/Kevin_Chamberlin" title="Kevin Chamberlin">Kevin Chamberlin</ref> played Horton, <ref target="/wiki/Michele_Pawk" title="Michele Pawk">Michele Pawk</ref> played Mayzie LaBird, <ref target="/wiki/Stuart_Zagnit" title="Stuart Zagnit">Stuart Zagnit</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Alice_Playten" title="Alice Playten">Alice Playten</ref> played Mr. and Mrs. Mayor, and <ref target="/wiki/Sharon_Wilkins" title="Sharon Wilkins">Sharon Wilkins</ref> played the Sour Kangaroo.</p>
<p>The show received almost universally negative reviews.<ref target="#cite_note-nytclose-7">[3]</ref> In January 2001,<ref target="#cite_note-ibdb-9">[5]</ref> in response to falling ticket sales, producers brought in <ref target="/wiki/Rosie_O%27Donnell" title="Rosie O'Donnell">Rosie O'Donnell</ref> to replace Shiner as the Cat in the Hat for a month-long engagement. The move was criticized as <ref target="/wiki/Stunt_casting" title="Stunt casting">stunt casting</ref>, but was successful at temporarily boosting ticket sales.<ref target="#cite_note-nytclose-7">[3]</ref> In March, young pop star <ref target="/wiki/Aaron_Carter" title="Aaron Carter">Aaron Carter</ref> and former Olympic gymnast <ref target="/wiki/Cathy_Rigby" title="Cathy Rigby">Cathy Rigby</ref> were cast for short engagements. Due to poor box office, the show closed on May 20, 2001 after 198 performances.<ref target="#cite_note-ibdb-9">[5]</ref> Its ultimate financial losses were estimated at $11 million, making it one of the worst financial flops in Broadway history.<ref target="#cite_note-nytclose-7">[3]</ref></p>

<h3>US tours[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Seussical&action=edit&section=10" title="Edit section: US tours">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Following the Broadway production, there were two US national tours. Rigby reprised her role as the Cat for the first tour which ran from September 2002 to June 2003.<ref target="#cite_note-10">[6]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-11">[7]</ref> A second non-<ref target="/wiki/Actors%27_Equity_Association" title="Actors' Equity Association">Equity</ref> production toured from 2003 to 2004.<ref target="#cite_note-12">[8]</ref></p>
<p>The script for the first tour was reworked extensively after the show's poor showing on Broadway, resulting in the removal or reworking of several songs. The biggest change involved Jojo, who was now initially an anonymous boy before the Cat pushed him into the story. Additional dialogue was included, and some songs and their reprises were cut. This version of the show is the one currently licensed by MTI as Seussical the Musical.</p>

<h3>Off-Broadway[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Seussical&action=edit&section=11" title="Edit section: Off-Broadway">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>A 90-minute <ref target="/wiki/Off-Broadway" title="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</ref> production was staged at the <ref target="/wiki/Lucille_Lortel_Theatre" title="Lucille Lortel Theatre">Lucille Lortel Theatre</ref> in 2007 by <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Theatreworks_USA" title="Theatreworks USA">Theatreworks USA</ref>. It was directed and choreographed by <ref target="/wiki/Marcia_Milgrom_Dodge" title="Marcia Milgrom Dodge">Marcia Milgrom Dodge</ref>. <ref target="#cite_note-13">[9]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-14">[10]</ref> This production was downscaled for the National Tour, which had its last show in spring 2014.</p>

<h3>West End (London)[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Seussical&action=edit&section=12" title="Edit section: West End (London)">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Seussical opened on the West End at the <ref target="/wiki/Arts_Theatre" title="Arts Theatre">Arts Theatre</ref> on December 4, 2012, presented by <ref target="/wiki/Selladoor_Worldwide" title="Selladoor Worldwide">Selladoor Worldwide</ref>. <ref target="#cite_note-stage-15">[11]</ref> It returned in 2013.<ref target="#cite_note-16">[12]</ref></p>

<h2>One-act versions[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Seussical&action=edit&section=13" title="Edit section: One-act versions">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>A one-act version of the Broadway show titled Seussical Jr. has been created as part of MTI's Jr. series. It is intended to be shorter and more accessible for junior high or middle school students, and has an average run time of 60 minutes.<ref target="#cite_note-17">[13]</ref> For Jr., various songs are cut and shortened; the subplots based on <ref target="/wiki/The_Butter_Battle_Book" title="The Butter Battle Book">The Butter Battle Book</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas!" title="How the Grinch Stole Christmas!">How the Grinch Stole Christmas!</ref>, and their relevant songs and characters, are removed to make the story more understandable for younger audiences, though the Grinch retains one line during the song "Here on Who". General Schmitz is replaced in "Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!" by the Wickersham Brothers. An additional musical number based on <ref target="/wiki/Dr._Seuss%27s_ABC" title="Dr. Seuss's ABC">Dr. Seuss's ABC</ref> is present, along with the relevant characters Ichabod and Izzy.</p>
<p>In 2004, Seussical was reworked into a "Theatre for Young America" version. The cast was reduced to 12 actors, with the plot changed to focus more on Horton.<ref target="#cite_note-18">[14]</ref></p>
