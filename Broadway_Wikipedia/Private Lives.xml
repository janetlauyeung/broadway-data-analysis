Despite a perpetually stormy relationship, they realise that they still have feelings for each other. Its second act love scene was nearly censored in Britain as too risqué.

<h2>Background[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Private_Lives&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Background">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Coward was in the middle of an extensive Asian tour when he contracted <ref target="/wiki/Influenza" title="Influenza">influenza</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-lahr59-1">[1]</ref> He spent the better part of his two-week convalescence sketching out the play and then completed the actual writing of the piece in only four days.<ref target="#cite_note-lahr59-1">[1]</ref> He immediately cabled <ref target="/wiki/Gertrude_Lawrence" title="Gertrude Lawrence">Gertrude Lawrence</ref> in New York to ask her to keep autumn 1930 free to appear in the play. After spending a few more weeks revising it, he typed the final draft in <ref target="/wiki/Peace_Hotel" title="Peace Hotel">The Cathay Hotel</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</ref> and sent copies to Lawrence and his <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Theatre_producer" title="Theatre producer">producer</ref> and manager, <ref target="/wiki/John_C._Wilson" title="John C. Wilson">John C. Wilson</ref>, with instructions to cable him with their reactions.<ref target="#cite_note-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>Coward received no fewer than 30 telegrams from Lawrence about the play. She first said that she had read the play and there was "nothing wrong with it that can't be fixed." Coward "wired back curtly that the only thing that was going to be fixed was her performance."<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> Lawrence was indecisive about what to do about her previous commitment to <ref target="/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Charlot" title="André Charlot">André Charlot</ref>. Coward finally responded that he planned to cast the play with another actress.<ref target="#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> By the time he returned to London, he found Lawrence not only had cleared her schedule but was staying at <ref target="/wiki/Edward_Molyneux" title="Edward Molyneux">Edward Molyneux</ref>'s villa in <ref target="/wiki/Cap-d%27Ail" title="Cap-d'Ail">Cap-d'Ail</ref> in southeastern France learning her lines.<ref target="#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> Coward joined her, and the two began rehearsing the scenes they shared. At the end of July they returned to London where Coward began to direct the production. Coward played the part of Elyot Chase himself, <ref target="/wiki/Adrianne_Allen" title="Adrianne Allen">Adrianne Allen</ref> was his bride Sibyl, Lawrence played Amanda Prynne, and <ref target="/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</ref> was her new husband Victor. Coward wrote Sibyl and Victor as minor characters, "extra puppets, lightly wooden ninepins, only to be repeatedly knocked down and stood up again".<ref target="#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> He later insisted, however, that they must be credible new spouses for the lead characters: "We've got to have two people as attractive as Larry and Adrianne were in the first place, if we can find them."<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>Rehearsals were still under way when the <ref target="/wiki/Lord_Chamberlain" title="Lord Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</ref> took exception to the second act love scene, labelling it too risqué in light of the fact the characters were divorced and married to others. Coward went to <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/St._James%27s_Palace" title="St. James's Palace">St. James's Palace</ref> to plead his case by acting out the play himself and assuring the censor that with artful direction the scene would be presented in a dignified and unobjectionable manner.<ref target="#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> Coward repeats one of his signature theatrical devices at the end of the play, where the main characters tiptoe out as the curtain falls – a device that he also used in <ref target="/wiki/Present_Laughter" title="Present Laughter">Present Laughter</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Hay_Fever_(play)" title="Hay Fever (play)">Hay Fever</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Blithe_Spirit_(play)" title="Blithe Spirit (play)">Blithe Spirit</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref></p>
<p>The play contains one of Coward's most popular songs, "Some Day I'll Find You". The Noël Coward Society's website, drawing on performing statistics from the publishers and the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Performing_Rights_Society" title="Performing Rights Society">Performing Rights Society</ref>, ranks it among Coward's ten most performed songs.<ref target="#cite_note-10">[10]</ref></p>

<p>Act 1</p>
<p>Following a brief courtship, Elyot and Sibyl are honeymooning at a hotel in <ref target="/wiki/Deauville" title="Deauville">Deauville</ref>,<ref target="#cite_note-11">[11]</ref> although her curiosity about his first marriage is not helping his romantic mood. In the adjoining suite, Amanda and Victor are starting their new life together, although he cannot stop thinking of the cruelty Amanda's ex-husband displayed towards her. Elyot and Amanda, following a volatile three-year-long marriage, have been divorced for the past five years, but they now discover that they are sharing a terrace while on their honeymoons with their new and younger spouses. Elyot and Amanda separately beg their new spouses to leave the hotel with them immediately, but both new spouses refuse to co-operate and each storms off to dine alone. Realising they still love each other and regretting having divorced, Elyot and Amanda abandon their spouses and run off together to Amanda's flat in Paris.</p>

<p>Act 2</p>
<p>After dinner at the Paris flat several days later, Elyot and Amanda use their code word "Solomon Isaacs", soon abbreviated to "Sollocks", to stop their arguments from getting out of hand. They kiss passionately, but the harmony cannot last: while Elyot and Amanda cannot live without each other, neither can they live with each other. They argue violently and try to outwit each other, just as they had done during their stormy marriage. Their ongoing argument escalates to a point of fury, as Amanda breaks a record over Elyot's head, and he retaliates by slapping her face. They seem to be trapped in a repeating cycle of love and hate as their private passions and jealousies consume them. At the height of their biggest fight, Sibyl and Victor walk in.</p>

<p>Act 3</p>
<p>The next morning, Amanda tries to sneak away early, but is surprised to find Sibyl and Victor there. As they talk, Elyot comes in, and he and Amanda start bickering again. It has been decided that neither of the new spouses will grant a divorce for a year, to give Amanda and Elyot time to confirm if this is really what they want. As tempers rise, Sibyl and Victor begin to bicker with each other, defending their respective spouses. Amanda and Elyot realise that Sibyl and Victor are as suited to each other as they are, forgive one another and sneak out, leaving the younger two together. As Elyot and Amanda tiptoe out, Victor and Sibyl have reached the point of mutual violence.</p>

<h2>Critical reception[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Private_Lives&action=edit&section=7" title="Edit section: Critical reception">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The original production received mixed reviews. Coward later wrote, "The critics described Private Lives variously as 'tenuous, thin, brittle, gossamer, iridescent, and delightfully daring'. All of which connoted in the public mind cocktails, repartee and irreverent allusions to copulation, thereby causing a gratifying number of respectable people to queue up at the box office."<ref target="#cite_note-71">[71]</ref> The Times wrote, "What an entertaining play it is!", but wondered if any other performers could bring it off.<ref target="#cite_note-72">[72]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Allardyce_Nicoll" title="Allardyce Nicoll">Allardyce Nicoll</ref> called it "amusing, no doubt, yet hardly moving farther below the surface than a paper boat in a bathtub and, like the paper boat, ever in imminent danger of becoming a shapeless, sodden mass."<ref target="#cite_note-73">[73]</ref> <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Manchester_Guardian" title="The Manchester Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</ref> commented, "The audience evidently found it a good entertainment, but Mr. Coward certainly had not flattered our intelligence. The play appears to be based on the theory that anything will do provided it be neatly done."<ref target="#cite_note-74">[74]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/The_Observer" title="The Observer">The Observer</ref> also thought that the play depended on brilliant acting and thought the characters unrealistic, though "None the less, for a couple of hours they are delicious company when Mr. Coward is master of unceremonious ceremonies."<ref target="#cite_note-75">[75]</ref> The <ref target="/wiki/New_Statesman" title="New Statesman">New Statesman</ref> discerned a sad side to the play in its story of a couple who can live neither with nor without each other: "It is not the least of Mr. Coward's achievements that he has ... disguised the grimness of his play and that his conception of love is really desolating."<ref target="#cite_note-76">[76]</ref></p>
<p>When the text was published, <ref target="/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The Times</ref> called it "unreadable",<ref target="#cite_note-77">[77]</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/The_Times_Literary_Supplement" title="The Times Literary Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</ref> found it "inexpressibly tedious" in print but acknowledged that its effectiveness on stage was "proved by the delight of a theatrical audience."<ref target="#cite_note-78">[78]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/T._E._Lawrence" title="T. E. Lawrence">T. E. Lawrence</ref>, however, wrote, "The play reads astonishingly well ... superb prose."<ref target="#cite_note-79">[79]</ref> The editor of <ref target="/wiki/Gramophone_(magazine)" title="Gramophone (magazine)">The Gramophone</ref> greeted Coward and Lawrence's 1930 recording of scenes from the play as a success and added, "I wish that Noel Coward would find time to write a short play for the gramophone, for neither of these extracts has enough completeness to bear indefinite repetition."<ref target="#cite_note-80">[80]</ref></p>

<h2>Literary analysis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Private_Lives&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: Literary analysis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Private Lives has been the subject of literary analysis under a range of literary theories. Coward expressed a dim view of such analyses: "Many years ago an earnest young man wrote a book about my plays. It was very intelligent and absolute rubbish."<ref target="#cite_note-81">[81]</ref> In a 2005 article, Penny Farfan analyses the play from the point of view of <ref target="/wiki/Queer_theory" title="Queer theory">queer theory</ref>, arguing that "the subversiveness of [Coward's] sexual identity is reflected in his work," and that Private Lives questions "the conventional gender norms on which compulsory heterosexuality depends."<ref target="#cite_note-farfan-82">[82]</ref> Positing that the leading characters' portrayal as equals is evidence in support of this theory, Farfan instances the famous image (shown above) of Coward and Lawrence as Elyot and Amanda smoking and "posing as mirror opposites".<ref target="#cite_note-farfan-82">[82]</ref> Coward himself pronounced the play "psychologically unstable",<ref target="#cite_note-83">[83]</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/John_Lahr" title="John Lahr">John Lahr</ref> in a 1982 study of Coward's plays writes, "Elyot and Amanda's outrageousness is used to propound the aesthetics of <ref target="/wiki/Camp_(style)" title="Camp (style)">high camp</ref> – an essentially homosexual view of the world that justifies detachment.<ref target="#cite_note-84">[84]</ref> However, in a 1992 article on "Coward and the Politics of Homosexual Representation", Alan Sinfield, examining gay aspects of Coward's major plays, mentions Private Lives only in passing.<ref target="#cite_note-85">[85]</ref> The critic <ref target="/wiki/Michael_Billington_(critic)" title="Michael Billington (critic)">Michael Billington</ref> writes of the piece, "It is not a closet gay play but a classic about the mysterious charm of androgeny."<ref target="#cite_note-billington-53">[53]</ref></p>
<p>The play has also been analysed as part of the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Theatre_of_the_absurd" title="Theatre of the absurd">theatre of the absurd</ref>. In a 1984 article, Archie J. Loss argues that nothing can ever happen in the relationship of Elyot and Amanda, because it is based on conflicting emotions: "they are bound to repeat themselves, playing out their scene again and again with different words and different props but always with the same result."<ref target="#cite_note-86">[86]</ref> In a 2000 study of Coward, Jean Chothia instances surreal exchanges in the play, such as: "Have you ever crossed the Sahara on a camel?" "Frequently. When I was a boy we used to do it all the time. My Grandmother had a wonderful seat on a camel."<ref target="#cite_note-87">[87]</ref></p>
