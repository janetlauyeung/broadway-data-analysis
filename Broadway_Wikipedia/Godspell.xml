<h2>Characters[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Godspell&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The show features eight non-<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biblical_characters" title="Biblical characters">Biblical characters</ref>, who sing and act out the parables: Gilmer (silly, a great storyteller); Robin (a tomboy); Herb (goofy and entertaining); Jeffrey (happy and excited); Joanne (eager and enthusiastic); Lamar (clumsy and unintentionally funny); Peggy (shy and loyal); and Sonia (dramatic with a put-on sensuality).<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> In the original script, licensed through Theatre Maximus, the "Christ" character and the "John" and "Judas" role are assigned the names of the original performers, Stephen and David.<ref target="#cite_note-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>In the revised script used for the 2011 Broadway revival, the names of the cast are again assigned to the non-Biblical roles: Nick, Telly, George, Anna Maria, Lindsay, Uzo, Morgan, and Celisse. Each character is also assigned a few character traits. An ensemble can also be added to the production if needed.<ref target="#cite_note-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>All ten actors are on stage throughout the entirety of the production.<ref target="#cite_note-HeraldTimes-6">[6]</ref></p>

<h2>Synopsis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Godspell&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Synopsis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Act I[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Godspell&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Act I">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The show opens with <ref target="/wiki/God" title="God">God</ref>'s voice, as spoken by <ref target="/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</ref>, declaring his supremacy: "My name is Known: God and King. I am most in majesty, in whom no beginning may be and no end." ("Opening (Monologue)"). The cast then enters and takes the roles of various <ref target="/wiki/Philosopher" title="Philosopher">philosophers</ref> who sing their philosophies, first alone, then in cacophonous <ref target="/wiki/Counterpoint" title="Counterpoint">counterpoint</ref> ("Prologue: Tower of Babble").</p>
<p>In response, <ref target="/wiki/John_the_Baptist" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist</ref> enters blowing a <ref target="/wiki/Shofar" title="Shofar">shofar</ref> to call the community to order. He then beckons them to "Prepare Ye, The Way of the Lord!" and baptizes the cast ("Prepare Ye"). John gives a short sermon, as <ref target="/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</ref> watches quietly. Jesus then announces his presence and says that he also wishes to be baptized. John instead asks to be baptized by Jesus. Jesus explains that "We do well now to conform with all that God requires" and is baptized by John. The cast enters and sings with Jesus ("Save the People").</p>
<p>In his first <ref target="/wiki/Parable" title="Parable">parable</ref>, Jesus explains that he has come "not to abolish the law and the prophets, but to complete". Jesus explains to the cast that those who adhere to the law of God will earn the highest place in the Kingdom of Heaven. He tells them the parable of <ref target="/wiki/Parable_of_the_Unjust_Judge" title="Parable of the Unjust Judge">the Widow and the Judge</ref>, demonstrating that God is a just jurist who will support those who cry out to him.</p>
<p>The cast begins to understand Jesus' teachings and take it upon themselves to tell the story of the <ref target="/wiki/Pharisee_and_the_Publican" title="Pharisee and the Publican">Pharisee and the Publican</ref> praying in the temple: "Every man who humbles himself shall be exalted!"</p>
<p>As Jesus teaches the law of the offering gifts at the altar, the cast makes offerings of themselves. They are taught that to approach God's altar, they must be pure of heart and soul. They then act out the <ref target="/wiki/Parable_of_the_Unforgiving_Servant" title="Parable of the Unforgiving Servant">Parable of the Unforgiving Servant</ref> a story of a master and a servant who owes him a debt. The servant asks his master for pity in repaying the debt, and the master absolves it. The servant then turns to a fellow servant who "owed him a few dollars" and demands that it be paid in full. The master, hearing this, then condemns the servant to prison. Jesus explains the moral: "Forgive your brothers from your heart." The character telling the parable sings "Day by Day", and the cast joins in. After the song, Jesus teaches that if one part of you offends God, it is better to lose it than to have the whole of the body thrown into hell.</p>
<p>The cast then plays <ref target="/wiki/Charades" title="Charades">charades</ref> to finish several statements posed by Jesus, including "If a man sues you for your shirt..." and "If a man asks you to go one mile with him...." The cast then performs the <ref target="/wiki/Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan" title="Parable of the Good Samaritan">Parable of the Good Samaritan</ref> as a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Play_Within_a_Play" title="Play Within a Play">play-within-a-play</ref>. Jesus explains the need to "love your enemies" and "not make a show of religion before men". He says: "God will reward a good deed done in secret" ("Shhh! It's a secret!").</p>
<p>The cast then performs the parable of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lazarus_and_Dives" title="Lazarus and Dives">Lazarus</ref> and the rich man. On earth, the rich man feasts, and Lazarus begs and is ignored. Upon dying, Lazarus is rewarded with Heaven, while the rich man is in Hell. The audience is told to "Learn Your Lessons Well" or be faced with eternal damnation. When the rich man asks Abraham if he would send Lazarus back from the dead to warn his brothers of their impending doom, Abraham tells him no: "If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone should rise from the dead."</p>
<p>Jesus teaches that no man can serve two masters (God and money). A member of the cast tells a story of a man who spent a lifetime acquiring the good things in life, then dies before he has the time to enjoy them. This character sings "Bless the Lord," then Jesus tells the cast not to worry about tomorrow: "Tomorrow will take care of itself. Today has problems of its own."</p>
<p>In an <ref target="/wiki/Antiphon" title="Antiphon">antiphonic</ref> chorus, the cast recites the <ref target="/wiki/Beatitudes" title="Beatitudes">Beatitudes</ref>. Judas directs the final beatitude regarding persecution at Jesus, and Jesus quickly changes the subject ("Did I ever tell you that I used to read feet?"). However, Jesus then persuades the cast that it is "All for the Best" and heaven contains the ultimate reward as Jesus and Judas do a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Soft_shoe" title="Soft shoe">soft shoe</ref> together.</p>
<p>This is followed by the <ref target="/wiki/Parable_of_the_Sower" title="Parable of the Sower">parable of the Sower of the Seeds</ref>, which Jesus tells them represent the Word of God ("All Good Gifts").</p>
<p>By this point in the musical, the group has transformed from a rag-tag cast, into a community of love and caring and now march as soldiers in the military, signifying their ability to think as one. With Jesus as the drill sergeant, they perform the <ref target="/wiki/Parable_of_the_Prodigal_Son" title="Parable of the Prodigal Son">Parable of the Prodigal Son</ref>. The cast sings "Light of the World" about Christ's Light and how it shines in each person.</p>

<h3>Intermission[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Godspell&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Intermission">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Jesus thanks the audience for coming and announces a 10-minute <ref target="/wiki/Intermission" title="Intermission">intermission</ref>.</p>
<p>There is audience interaction during intermission. In the original production, the cast joined the audience for wine and bread. In the 2011 Broadway revival, the audience was offered wine on the stage.</p>
<p>The second act then opens with one or more cast members singing "Learn Your Lessons Well", calling the audience back to their seats.</p>

<h3>Act II[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Godspell&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Act II">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>After the reprise of "Learn Your Lessons Well", a member of the cast sings "Turn Back, O Man", imploring mankind to give up its temporal pursuits and turn to God. Jesus then says: "This is the beginning."</p>
<p>Several members of the cast then begin to question Jesus's authority, and he responds with yet another parable. He is asked, "What is the greatest commandment?" and responds, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul... And the second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'" The <ref target="/wiki/Pharisees" title="Pharisees">Pharisees</ref> continue to question him, and he laments "Alas for You" and calls them hypocrites. Members of the cast gather, join in Jesus' song, and throw garbage at the Pharisees.</p>
<p>Jesus predicts that he will not be seen for quite a while, while standing at the "<ref target="/wiki/Western_Wall" title="Western Wall">Wailing Wall</ref>", and predicts great wars and famines. He reminds the cast and audience of the time of <ref target="/wiki/Noah" title="Noah">Noah</ref> and teaches that faith can calm the storm. The cast is told: "Keep awake, then. For the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Son_of_Man" title="Son of Man">Son of Man</ref> will come at a time when you least expect it."</p>
<p>One woman in the cast is shunned as an <ref target="/wiki/Adultery" title="Adultery">adulteress</ref>. Jesus says: "Let the one of you who is faultless cast the first stone." Her accusers then bow their heads and walk away. Jesus walks over to her and asks: "Woman... where are they now? Has no one condemned you?" The woman answers: "No one, sir." He tells her: "Then nor shall I. You may go, but do not sin again." As she watches Jesus walk from her, she entreats him to remain "By My Side". During this song, Judas foretells his upcoming betrayal of Jesus.</p>
<p>In one of the lighter moments in the second act, Jesus tells how he will separate men as a shepherd separates his flock into <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Domestic_sheep" title="Domestic sheep">sheep</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Goat" title="Goat">goats</ref>. The sheep will enter heaven while the goats must suffer eternal damnation. "We Beseech Thee" cry the goats, begging for mercy.</p>
<p>After the song, the cast reminds each other to take things "Day By Day", as they remove their clown makeup, face paint, or object. They assemble for the <ref target="/wiki/Last_Supper" title="Last Supper">Last Supper</ref> and Jesus tells them that one of them will betray him. Each member of the cast asks, "Is it I?" ending with Judas: "Rabbi... can you mean me?" Jesus tells him to do quickly what he must do and Judas runs off. Jesus breaks the bread and shares the wine, while saying the traditional Hebrew <ref target="/wiki/Passover_Seder" title="Passover Seder">Seder</ref> blessings. He tells his followers that they will dine together in the Kingdom of Heaven. The band sings "On the Willows", which is about what has been sacrificed. In the song, Jesus says goodbye to the cast. He asks that they wait for him as he goes into the <ref target="/wiki/Gethsemane" title="Gethsemane">Garden of Gethsemane</ref> to pray.</p>
<p>In the garden, Jesus implores God to let the burden be lifted from his shoulders if there is another way. Jesus returns to his followers to find them all asleep. He begs them to stay awake, but they all fall asleep again and Jesus warns them they will all betray him three times (a reference to the apostle <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Peter_(apostle)" title="Peter (apostle)">Peter</ref>). Jesus then prays to God that if his death cannot pass him by, then His will must be done. He is then tempted by <ref target="/wiki/Satan" title="Satan">Satan</ref> (usually played by the apostles), but orders him away.</p>
<p>Judas returns to betray Jesus, but has a moment where he cannot bring himself to do it. Judas finds himself boxed in by invisible walls, except for one path which leads to Jesus. Jesus encourages Judas to do what he has come to do, and Judas grabs Jesus to bring him to be <ref target="/wiki/Crucifixion" title="Crucifixion">crucified</ref>. The community starts to attack Judas, while Jesus tells them to stop, as all who live by the sword will one day die by it. Judas (usually alone, as a representation of the others arresting Jesus) ties Jesus upon an electric fence (representative of the cross) as Jesus berates him for arresting him at night, but then says that it had to happen to fulfill the prophets' writings.</p>
<p>The "Finale" begins, loud and in B-minor, with Jesus wailing, "Oh, God, I'm bleeding," and the community answers: "Oh, God, You're bleeding." Jesus dies and the music ends. The women of the cast sing "Long Live God", and the men join in with "Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord" in counterpoint. The cast removes Jesus from the fence and carries him out, either offstage or through the aisles. The cast then finishes with a reprise of "Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord," ending the show full of love and faith.</p>

<h3>Ending interpretation[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Godspell&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Ending interpretation">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Similar to criticism of <ref target="/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar" title="Jesus Christ Superstar">Jesus Christ Superstar</ref> there is controversy over there being no obvious allusion to the <ref target="/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus" title="Resurrection of Jesus">Resurrection of Jesus</ref> in the show. It can be interpreted that either the singing of "Prepare Ye" in the finale or the curtain call, where all including Jesus return to the stage, represents the resurrection. The <ref target="/wiki/Music_Theatre_International" title="Music Theatre International">Music Theatre International</ref> script states that while either representation is valid, both miss the point, and that the show is about love, not whether or not Jesus is resurrected.</p>

<h3>Tower of Babble[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Godspell&action=edit&section=10" title="Edit section: Tower of Babble">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>"Tower of Babble," the show's opening number, is often omitted by many productions. The song consists of the eight disciples (or soloists) acting out as philosophers, each singing about their various philosophies. They grow increasingly more irritated with each other, sing in contradiction, and eventually run out of words. "Prepare Ye" follows this prologue.</p>
<p>In the original productions, the philosophers were <ref target="/wiki/Socrates" title="Socrates">Socrates</ref> (<ref target="/wiki/Gilmer_McCormick" title="Gilmer McCormick">Gilmer McCormick</ref>), <ref target="/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</ref> (<ref target="/wiki/Jeffrey_Mylett" title="Jeffrey Mylett">Jeffrey Mylett</ref>), <ref target="/wiki/Martin_Luther" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</ref> (Joanne Jonas) <ref target="/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</ref> (<ref target="/wiki/Lamar_Alford" title="Lamar Alford">Lamar Alford</ref>), <ref target="/wiki/Edward_Gibbon" title="Edward Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</ref> (<ref target="/wiki/Sonia_Manzano" title="Sonia Manzano">Sonia Manzano</ref>), <ref target="/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre" title="Jean-Paul Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</ref> (Peggy Gordon), <ref target="/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</ref> (Robin Lamont), and <ref target="/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller" title="Buckminster Fuller">Buckminster Fuller</ref> (Herb Braha). In the 2001 revival, Luther, Gibbon, Nietzsche, and Fuller were replaced by <ref target="/wiki/Galileo_Galilei" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo Galilei</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_(theologian)" title="Jonathan Edwards (theologian)">Jonathan Edwards</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard" title="L.

The 2011 revival retains Galilei, Hubbard, and Williamson, but restores Gibbon and replaces da Vinci with <ref target="/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel" title="Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel">Georg Hegel</ref>.</p>
<p>On many early cast recordings, including the original off-Broadway recording and the original London recording, the prologue was omitted in order to produce an album that could sell as a pop album. This omission was for marketing purposes and was not meant to diminish the importance of the number, as Stephen Schwartz has repeatedly stated. As a consequence, some audiences have gotten the impression that this number was added into the score later.</p>

<h3>Beautiful City[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Godspell&action=edit&section=11" title="Edit section: Beautiful City">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>"Beautiful City" was written in 1972 as part of the film and re-written in 1993 after the <ref target="/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots" title="1992 Los Angeles riots">Rodney King riots in Los Angeles</ref>. In the film, it follows "Alas for You" and "By My Side", omitting the parable typically found in between these two numbers.</p>
<p>In the decades following the film's release, many directors have chosen to use the lyrics from the original film version, sometimes to replace the "Day by Day" reprise, "Tower of Babble", as the prologue, or adding it the end of the musical as an additional scene depicting the Resurrection. </p>
<p>The 2011 Broadway revival places "Beautiful City" after "We Beseech Thee" and just before the Last Supper, sung by Jesus as a slow ballad. This production used the revised 1993 lyrics and is included on its cast recording, along with a cover by <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/John_Ondrasik" title="John Ondrasik">John Ondrasik</ref> of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Five_For_Fighting" title="Five For Fighting">Five For Fighting</ref> as a bonus track.</p>
<p>Some productions use both the original upbeat film version as a prologue as well as the ballad version, either in its original place just before the Last Supper whereupon the Day By Day reprise is used as the Resurrection, or as an epilogue depicting the resurrection itself.</p>
<ref target="/wiki/Music_Theatre_International" title="Music Theatre International">Music Theater International</ref>'s Broadway Junior series, which edits popular musicals to one act appropriate for a middle school cast, "Beautiful City" is included in the show. Godspell Junior contains most of the first act and almost none of the second act. "By My Side" is omitted entirely. "Beautiful City" is placed at the beginning of the second act and is immediately followed by the Last Supper, the Betrayal, and the Crucifixion.

<h2>Controversy[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Godspell&action=edit&section=28" title="Edit section: Controversy">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The <ref target="/wiki/Hippie" title="Hippie">hippie</ref> clothing that the cast wears in the play has caused some controversy.<ref target="#cite_note-FAQ-25">[25]</ref> In his "Notes on the Script" (1999), Stephen Schwartz wrote, "There are often misconceptions about the concept of the clown analogy in Godspell. For instance, sometimes cast members are thought to be 'hippies' or '<ref target="/wiki/Flower_child" title="Flower child">flower children</ref>'. The concept was derived by John-Michael Tebelak from a book by <ref target="/wiki/Harvey_Cox" title="Harvey Cox">Harvey Cox</ref>, a professor at <ref target="/wiki/Harvard_Divinity_School" title="Harvard Divinity School">Harvard Divinity School</ref>, entitled Feast of Fools."<ref target="#cite_note-26">[26]</ref></p>
<p>There has also been some controversy or confusion over Godspell's lack of a resurrection scene. This criticism notably mirrors similar criticism leveled at fellow musical <ref target="/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar" title="Jesus Christ Superstar">Jesus Christ Superstar</ref> which also did not depict the resurrection.</p>
<p>Rather than be resurrected, Jesus dies in the "Finale", and the cast is typically directed to lift his body over their heads and walk off through the audience to end the show. Schwartz has made a note of this in the script, saying:</p>

<p>Over the years, there has been comment from some about the lack of an apparent Resurrection in the show. Some choose to view the curtain call, in which JESUS appears, as symbolic of the resurrection; others point to the moment when the cast raise JESUS above their heads. While either view is valid, both miss the point. GODSPELL is about the formation of a community which carries on JESUS' teachings after he has gone. In other words, it is the effect JESUS has on the OTHERS which is the story of the show, not whether or not he himself is resurrected. Therefore, it is very important at the end of the show that it be clear that the OTHERS have come through the violence and pain of the crucifixion sequence and leave with a joyful determination to carry on the ideas and feelings they have learned during the course of the show.<ref target="#cite_note-27">[27]</ref></p>
<p>Though Godspell was a successful production, much like Jesus Christ Superstar, that began to break down the barriers between rock and roll and Christianity, it was regarded with suspicion by the mainstream evangelical culture because it did not emphasize the religion doctrines of resurrection and atonement.<ref target="#cite_note-28">[28]</ref> The social statement made by Godspell when it first premiered was a serious one at a time when <ref target="/wiki/Christianity_in_the_United_States" title="Christianity in the United States">Christianity in the United States</ref> was being pulled in different directions; interest in mainstream Christianity was dwindling, especially among the youth, who wanted to leave the Church but not Christianity. Godspell captured this youthful sentiment that reimagined Jesus as a hippie in a more primitive expression of their faith, relating to Jesus not as an object to venerate but as a companion, which contemporary reviewer Clive Barnes described as a "perfectly contemporary and perfectly vulgar concept of peace and goodwill to all men". Barnes went on to call the "whole premise rather nauseating”, a view that was in line with the response in mainline congregations.<ref target="#cite_note-29">[29]</ref></p>
