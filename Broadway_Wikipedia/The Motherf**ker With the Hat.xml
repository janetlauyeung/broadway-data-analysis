<h2>Synopsis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Motherfucker_with_the_Hat&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Synopsis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Jackie is a former <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Drug_dealer" title="Drug dealer">drug dealer</ref> who has just been released from prison to join the <ref target="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">American</ref> workforce. His girlfriend, Veronica, however, still uses <ref target="/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</ref> and other drugs. In fact, the play begins with an intense and comic phone conversation between Veronica and her mother, who's also an addict. Then Jackie arrives, full of good intentions and pent-up testosterone.</p>
<p>But just as Jackie and Veronica are jumping into bed, he sees a hat in her apartment. Realizing it is not his, he accuses her of cheating, going to his drug and <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parole_officer" title="Parole officer">parole counselor</ref>, Ralph D., for help. Meanwhile, Ralph's wife, Victoria, has "had it up to here with his helium".<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>Jackie obtains a gun. Ralph insists that he not keep it, so he gives it to his cousin Julio for safekeeping. Jackie reveals that he had slept with his previous AA counselor, which may be part of the reason Veronica mistrusts him. Later, Veronica is entertaining a lover, which is revealed to be Ralph. They had slept together a handful of times while Jackie was in prison.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jackie gets the gun back and returns the hat to the guy who he thinks is its owner. Jackie then throws it on the floor and shoots it. He talks about this with Victoria, who is tired of Ralph's cheating and begs Jackie to sleep with her. She reveals to him that Veronica and Ralph have slept together—he (the trusted Ralph) was really "the motherfucker with the hat."</p>
<p>Jackie shows up at Veronica's apartment drunk, accusing her of cheating, hurt because they have been in love since high school. When he gets loud, she hits him with a bat.</p>
<p>Julio takes Jackie in. He reveals that he is grateful because, years ago, Jackie showed unexpected kindness to him. Jackie wants to confront Ralph and Julio is willing to cover his back, claiming to be a "Van Damme".</p>
<p>Jackie goes to Ralph's. The two men try to fight it out, but end up futilely wrestling on the floor. Ralph admits he slept with Veronica, but he talks tough with Jackie—that's the way the world is, etc., and why don't you toughen up? -- and would like to be friends with Jackie. Jackie refuses to accept his friendship and returns to the apartment to pick up his things. He has broken parole by shooting the gun and is heading off to prison for a short stint. He tries to tell Veronica he loves her, but she runs out of the room, unwilling to listen. He leaves. A few moments later, Veronica comes out of hiding and calls his name.</p>

<h3>Critical reception[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Motherfucker_with_the_Hat&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Critical reception">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>On its opening night performance, The Motherfucker with the Hat received mixed reviews from New York critics.</p>
<p>The <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</ref>'s review wrote, "What makes Hat more than just a foul-mouthed, fast-moving farce is that Mr. Guirgis's real subject turns out to be <ref target="/wiki/Moral_relativism" title="Moral relativism">moral relativism</ref>. The impeccably sober Ralph D., who has swapped booze for fluorescent-colored nutritional beverages, preaches the gospel of AA with a convert's fervor, yet it doesn't stop him from doing whatever he wants to whomever he wants. Jackie, by contrast, has yet to master his self-destructive impulses, but at least he knows that the point of getting sober is not to become more efficient at taking advantage of other people: "Your – whaddyacallit – your world view? It ain't mine. And the day it is, that's the day I shoot myself in the head. I didn't get clean to live like that."... Don't let the stupid title put you off. If you do, you'll miss one of the best new plays to come to Broadway in ages."<ref target="#cite_note-13">[13]</ref></p>
<ref target="/wiki/Ben_Brantley" title="Ben Brantley">Ben Brantley</ref> of <ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref> said, "The play that dare not speak its name turns out to have a lot to say. Stephen Adly Guirgis’s vibrant and surprisingly serious new comedy opened on Monday night at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater under a title that cannot be printed in most daily newspapers or mentioned on network television. This is vexing for those of us who would like to extol the virtues of "The ___________ with the Hat", at least in public. (The title also seems to have created problems for the people trying to publicize the play.) This is by far the most accomplished and affecting work from the gifted Mr. Guirgis, a prolific and erratic chronicler of marginal lives."<ref target="#cite_note-NYT-1">[1]</ref>
<p>The <ref target="/wiki/New_York_Post" title="New York Post">New York Post</ref> gave mixed reactions: "In his Broadway debut, Chris Rock plays Ralph D., the AA sponsor of Bobby Cannavale's Jackie. They share some heavy scenes – red-blooded, profanity-laden bouts – but Rock is a lightweight: The more experienced, more assured Cannavale knocks him out without even trying. This is a big problem because Stephen Adly Guirgis' new dark comedy, "The Motherf**ker with the Hat", pivots on the evolving relationship between the two. Rock's tentative performance creates an imbalance that throws the show out of whack."<ref target="#cite_note-14">[14]</ref></p>
<p>In reviewing the production, Marilyn Stasio (<ref target="/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</ref>) wrote, "... Anna D. Shapiro [is] an entirely worthy helmer, [but] doesn't seem to speak the same theatrical language as the [cast]."<ref target="#cite_note-variety-5">[5]</ref> Scott Brown in <ref target="/wiki/New_York_(magazine)" title="New York (magazine)">New York</ref> gave a negative review, saying, "But the play really doesn’t have the heft to earn the death of hope, nor does it have the stones or the seriousness to declare hope officially dead. Motherf**ker mainly concerns itself with a lot of big, mordant laughs ... yet overall, the play feels jumpy and scant."<ref target="#cite_note-st-15">[15]</ref></p>
<p>The Motherfucker with the Hat has also been produced in regional theaters. A version (Nov. 21-Dec. 8, 2013) at <ref target="/wiki/Barebones_productions" title="Barebones productions">barebones productions</ref> in Pittsburgh received a strong response, both in the press and the box office. The "<ref target="/wiki/Pittsburgh_Post-Gazette" title="Pittsburgh Post-Gazette">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</ref>" said, in part, that in contrast with other plays staged at this time of year, the play is "sort of cute, definitely colorful, more tart than sweet and not wholesome at all, but, for those who don't find all that a drawback, astonishingly funny."<ref target="#cite_note-16">[16]</ref></p>

<h3>Box office sales and advertising[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Motherfucker_with_the_Hat&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Box office sales and advertising">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Michael Riedel in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_New_York_Post" title="The New York Post">The New York Post</ref> reported that in early April 2011, the show only grossed $239,000, though its gross potential was $867,000: "For whatever reason, nobody wants to see this show". The production is expected to cost $3 million. He noted that the title of the show has been "debilitating" for advertising. Wrote Riedel, "[They] simply can't get the name of the play out there, [because] Chris can talk about it, but he can't say the title, so nobody knows what it is."<ref target="#cite_note-17">[17]</ref></p>
<p>According to <ref target="/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</ref>, the box-office takings of the show during its first week of preview performances were $239,221.<ref target="#cite_note-18">[18]</ref> In The Motherfucker with the Hat's opening week, it grossed $270,309, playing to 82.9% capacity.<ref target="#cite_note-19">[19]</ref></p>
<p>To advertise the show, Rock has made appearances on <ref target="/wiki/CBS_News" title="CBS News">CBS News</ref><ref target="#cite_note-20">[20]</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Late_Show_with_David_Letterman" title="Late Show with David Letterman">Late Show with David Letterman</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-21">[21]</ref> In addition, he was interviewed by <ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref><ref target="#cite_note-Caramanica-4">[4]</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/ABC_News" title="ABC News">ABC News</ref>, among others.<ref target="#cite_note-22">[22]</ref></p>
<p>The show closed the week ended July 17, 2011 after 112 performances and finished in the top 10 for its final week with a gross of $870,024 being at 101.3% capacity. Its total gross was $10,451,323.<ref target="#cite_note-23">[23]</ref></p>
