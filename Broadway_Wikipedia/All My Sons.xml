<h2>Background[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=All_My_Sons&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Background">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Miller wrote All My Sons after his first play <ref target="/wiki/The_Man_Who_Had_All_the_Luck" title="The Man Who Had All the Luck">The Man Who Had All the Luck</ref> failed on <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref>, lasting only four performances. Miller wrote All My Sons as a final attempt at writing a commercially successful play; he vowed to "find some other line of work"<ref target="#cite_note-about-1">[1]</ref> if the play did not find an audience.</p>
<p>All My Sons is based upon a true story, which Arthur Miller's then-mother-in-law pointed out in an Ohio newspaper.<ref target="#cite_note-MEY-3">[3]</ref> The news story described how in 1941–43 the <ref target="/wiki/Curtiss-Wright" title="Curtiss-Wright">Wright Aeronautical Corporation</ref> based in Ohio had conspired with army inspection officers to approve defective aircraft engines destined for military use.<ref target="#cite_note-MEY-3">[3]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-CLAU-4">[4]</ref> The story of defective engines had reached investigators working for Sen. <ref target="/wiki/Harry_S._Truman" title="Harry S. Truman">Harry Truman</ref>'s congressional investigative board after several Wright aircraft assembly workers informed on the company; they would later testify under oath before Congress.<ref target="#cite_note-MEY-3">[3]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-CLAU-4">[4]</ref> In 1944, three Army Air Force officers, Lt. Col. Frank C. Greulich, Major Walter A. Ryan, and Major William Bruckmann were relieved of duty and later convicted of neglect of duty.<ref target="#cite_note-HIN-5">[5]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-6">[6]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-MILW-7">[7]</ref></p>
<ref target="/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen" title="Henrik Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</ref>'s influence on Miller is evidenced from the Ibsen play <ref target="/wiki/The_Wild_Duck" title="The Wild Duck">The Wild Duck</ref>, where Miller took the idea of two partners in a business where one is forced to take moral and legal responsibility for the other. This is mirrored in All My Sons. He also borrowed the idea of a character's idealism being the source of a problem.<ref target="#cite_note-8">[8]</ref>
<p>The criticism of the <ref target="/wiki/American_Dream" title="American Dream">American Dream</ref>, which lies at the heart of All My Sons, was one reason why Arthur Miller was called to appear before the <ref target="/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee" title="House Un-American Activities Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</ref> during the 1950s, when America was gripped by anti-communist sentiment. Miller sent a copy of the play to <ref target="/wiki/Elia_Kazan" title="Elia Kazan">Elia Kazan</ref> who directed the original stage version of All My Sons. Kazan was a former member of the Communist Party who shared Miller's left-wing views. However, their relationship was destroyed when Kazan gave names of suspected Communists to the House Un-American Activities Committee during the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_Red_Scare" title="Second Red Scare">Red Scare</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-about-1">[1]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref></p>

<h2>Characters[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=All_My_Sons&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Joe Keller — Joe, 60, was exonerated after being charged with knowingly shipping defective aircraft engine cylinder heads (for <ref target="/wiki/Curtiss_P-40_Warhawk" title="Curtiss P-40 Warhawk">Curtiss P-40 Warhawks</ref>) from his factory to the military during <ref target="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</ref>, causing the deaths of 21 pilots. For over three years he has placed the blame on his partner and former neighbor, Steve Deever, although he himself committed the crime. When the truth comes out, Joe justifies his actions by claiming that he did it for his family.</p>
<p>Kate Keller (Mother) — Kate knows that Joe is guilty but lives in denial while mourning for her older son Larry, who has been <ref target="/wiki/Missing_in_action" title="Missing in action">MIA</ref> for three years. She refuses to believe that Larry is dead and maintains that Ann Deever — who returns for a visit at the request of Larry's brother Chris — is still "Larry's girl" and also believes that he is coming back.</p>
<p>Chris Keller — Chris, 32, returned home from <ref target="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</ref> two years before the play begins, disturbed by the realization that the world was continuing as if nothing had happened. He has summoned Ann Deever to the Keller house in order to ask her hand in marriage, but they're faced with the obstacle of Kate's unreasonable conviction that Larry will someday return. Chris idolizes his father, not knowing initially what he has done.</p>
<p>Ann Deever — Ann, 26, arrives at the Keller home having shunned her "guilty" father since his imprisonment. Throughout the play, Ann is often referred to as pretty, beautiful, and intelligent-looking and as "Annie". She had a relationship with Larry Keller before his</p>
<p>disappearance and has since moved on because she knows the truth of his fate. She hopes that the Kellers will consent to her marriage to Larry's brother, Chris, with whom she has corresponded by mail for two years. Ann is the truth-bearer in the play.</p>
<p>George Deever — George, 31, is Ann's older brother: a successful New York lawyer, <ref target="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">WWII</ref> veteran, and a childhood friend of Chris's. He initially believed in his father's guilt, but upon visiting Steve in jail, realizes his innocence and becomes enraged at the Kellers for deceiving him. He returns to save his sister from her marriage to Chris, creating the catalyzing final events.</p>
<p>Dr. Jim Bayliss — Jim is a successful doctor, but is frustrated with the stifling domesticity of his life. He wants to become a medical researcher, but continues in his job as it pays the bills. He is a close friend to the Keller family and spends a lot of time in their backyard.</p>
<p>Sue Bayliss — Sue is Jim's wife: needling and dangerous, but affectionate. She too is a friend of the Keller family, but is secretly resentful of what she sees as Chris's bad idealistic influence on Jim. Sue confronts Ann about her resentment of Chris in a particularly volatile scene.</p>
<p>Frank Lubey — Frank, 33, was always one year ahead of the draft, so he never served in World War II, instead staying home to marry George's former sweetheart, Lydia. He draws up Larry's horoscope and tells Kate that Larry must still be alive, because the day he died was meant to be his "favorable day". This strengthens Kate's faith and makes it much harder for Ann to move on.</p>
<p>Lydia Lubey — Lydia, 27, was George's love interest before the war; after he went away, she married Frank and they soon had three children. She is a model of peaceful domesticity and lends a much-needed cheerful air to several moments of the play.</p>
<p>Bert — Bert is a little boy who lives in the neighborhood; he is friends with the Bayliss' son Tommy and frequently visits the Kellers' yard to play "jail" with Joe. He appears only twice in the play: the first time, his part seems relatively unimportant, but the second time his character is more important as he sparks a verbal attack from mother when mentioning "jail," which highlights Joe's secret.</p>

<h3>Unseen characters[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=All_My_Sons&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Unseen characters">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Larry Keller —Larry has been <ref target="/wiki/Missing_in_action" title="Missing in action">MIA</ref> for some years at the start of the play. However, he has a significant effect on the play through his mother's insistence that he is still alive and his brother's love for Larry's childhood sweetheart, Ann. Comparisons are also made in the story between Larry and Chris; in particular, their father describes Larry as the more sensible one with a "head for business".</p>
<p>Steve Deever — George and Ann's father. Steve is sent to prison for shipping faulty aircraft parts—a crime that not only he but also the exonerated Keller committed.</p>

<h2>Synopsis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=All_My_Sons&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Synopsis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Act I[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=All_My_Sons&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Act I">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The play starts in the middle of the action, abruptly. In August 1947, Joe Keller, a self-made businessman, and his wife Kate are visited by a neighbor, Frank. At Kate's request, Frank is trying to figure out the horoscope of the Kellers' missing son Larry, who disappeared three years earlier while serving in the military during World War II. There has been a storm and the tree planted in Larry's honor has blown down during the month of his death, making it seem that Larry is still alive. While Kate still believes Larry is coming back, the Kellers' other son, Chris, believes differently. Furthermore, Chris wishes to propose to Ann Deever, who was Larry's girlfriend at the time he went missing and who has been corresponding with Chris for two years. Joe and Kate react to this news with shock but are interrupted by Bert, the boy next door. He tattles to Joe and wants to see the "jail". In a game, Bert brings up the word "jail", making Kate react sharply. When Ann arrives, it is revealed that her father, Steve Deever, is in prison for selling cracked cylinder heads to the Air Force, causing the deaths of twenty-one pilots. Joe was his partner but was exonerated of the crime. Ann admits that neither she nor her brother keep in touch with their father anymore and wonders aloud whether a faulty engine was responsible for Larry's death. After a heated argument, Chris breaks in and later proposes to Ann, who accepts. Chris also reveals that while leading a company he lost all his men and is experiencing <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Survivor%27s_guilt" title="Survivor's guilt">survivor's guilt</ref>. Meanwhile, Joe receives a phone call from George, Ann's brother, who is coming there to settle something.</p>

<h3>Act II[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=All_My_Sons&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Act II">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Although Chris and Ann have become engaged, Chris avoids telling his mother. Their next door neighbor Sue emerges, revealing that everyone on the block thinks Joe is equally guilty of the crime of supplying faulty aircraft engines. Shortly afterwards, George Deever arrives and reveals that he has just visited the prison to see his father Steve. The latter has confirmed that Joe told him by phone to cover up the cracked cylinders and to send them out, and later gave a false promise to Steve that he would account for the shipment on the day of arrest. George insists his sister Ann cannot marry Chris Keller, son of the man who destroyed the Deevers. Meanwhile, Frank reveals his horoscope, implying that Larry is alive, which is just what Kate wants to hear. Joe maintains that on the fateful day of dispatch, the flu laid him up, but Kate says that Joe has not been sick in fifteen years. Despite George's protests, Ann sends him away.</p>
<p>When Kate claims to Chris (who is still intent on marrying Ann) that moving on from Larry will be forsaking Joe as a murderer, Chris concludes that George was right. Joe, out of excuses, explains that he sent out the cracked airheads to avoid closure of the business, intending to notify the base later that they needed repairs. However, when the fleet crashed and made headlines, he lied to Steve and abandoned him at the factory to be arrested. Chris cannot accept this explanation, and exclaims in despair that he is torn about what to do about his father now.</p>

<h3>Act III[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=All_My_Sons&action=edit&section=7" title="Edit section: Act III">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Chris has left home. Reluctantly accepting the accusations against her husband, Kate says that, should Chris return, Joe must express willingness to go to prison in the hope that Chris will relent. As he only sought to make money at the insistence of his family, Joe is adamant that their relationship is above the law. Soon after, Ann emerges and expresses her intention to leave with Chris regardless of Kate's disdain. When Kate angrily refuses again, Ann reveals to Kate a letter from Larry. She had not wanted to share it, but knows that Kate must face reality. Chris returns, and is torn about whether to turn Joe in to the authorities, knowing it doesn't erase the death of his fellow soldiers or absolve the world of its natural merciless state.</p>
<p>When Joe returns and excuses his guilt on account of his life's accomplishments, his son wearily responds, "I know you're no worse than other men, but I thought you were better. I never saw you as a man ... I saw you as my father." Finally, the letter, read by Chris, reveals that because of his father's guilt, Larry planned to commit suicide. With this final blow, Joe finally agrees to turn himself in, saying of Larry, "Sure, he was my son. But I think to him they were all my sons. And I guess they were, I guess they were". Joe goes inside to get his coat, and kills himself with a gunshot off stage. At the end, when Chris expresses remorse in spite of his resolve, Kate tells him not to blame himself and to move on with his life.</p>

<h3>Timeline[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=All_My_Sons&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: Timeline">edit</ref>]</h3>

<h2>Arthur Miller quotation on All My Sons[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=All_My_Sons&action=edit&section=9" title="Edit section: Arthur Miller quotation on All My Sons">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>In his Collected Plays, Miller commented on his feelings on watching an audience's reaction to a performance of his first successful play:</p>


<p>The success of a play, especially one's first success, is somewhat like pushing against a door which suddenly opens from the other side. One may fall on one's face or not, but certainly a new room is opened that was always securely shut until then. For myself, the experience was invigorating. It made it possible to dream of daring more and risking more. The audience sat in silence before the unwinding of All My Sons and gasped when they should have, and I tasted that power which is reserved, I imagine, for playwrights, which is to know that by one's invention a mass of strangers has been publicly transfixed.</p>
