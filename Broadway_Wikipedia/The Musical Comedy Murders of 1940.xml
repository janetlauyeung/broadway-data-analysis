<h2>Synopsis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Musical_Comedy_Murders_of_1940&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Synopsis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The creative team responsible for a recent <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref> <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Box_office_flop" title="Box office flop">flop</ref> (in which three chorus girls were murdered by the mysterious "Stage Door Slasher") assemble for a backer's audition of their new show at the Westchester estate of a wealthy "angel." The house is replete with sliding panels, secret passageways and a German maid who is apparently four different people- all of which figure diabolically in the comic mayhem that follows when the infamous "slasher" makes his reappearance and strikes again.</p>

<h2>Plot[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Musical_Comedy_Murders_of_1940&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Plot">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The play takes place in a <ref target="/wiki/Mansion" title="Mansion">mansion</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/Chappaqua,_New_York" title="Chappaqua, New York">Chappaqua, New York</ref> in December 1940, specifically, the library. The mansion is owned by Elsa Von Grossenknueten, and her maid, Helsa Wenzel.</p>
<p>In the opening scene, we see Helsa is killed by a masked figure. We also see Elsa talking to a police officer, Michael Kelly, about some sort of undercover scheme. Both are unaware of the maid's murder.</p>
<p>The next morning, we see Helsa again, only now her entire personality seems to have changed overnight. The guests Elsa has invited soon begin to arrive. They have been invited for a backer's audition to the Musical White House Merry-Go-Round.</p>
<p>The first of the invited guests is an Irish <ref target="/wiki/Tenor" title="Tenor">tenor</ref> named Patrick O'Reilly. He's quickly followed by a bombastic <ref target="/wiki/Theatre_director" title="Theatre director">theatre director</ref> named Ken De La Maize, and a beautiful young singer/dancer named Nikki Crandall. Nikki is followed in by a young (and bad) comedian named Eddie McCuen, who takes an instant liking to Nikki.</p>
<p>While talking with Nikki, Eddie realizes that everyone coming (including Marjorie Baverstock, the <ref target="/wiki/Theatrical_producer" title="Theatrical producer">producer</ref>, and Roger Hopewell and Bernice Roth, the writers) were all part of the creative team that made Manhattan Holiday, in which The Stage Door Slasher murdered three women. Eddie instantly wants to leave, and tells Nikki that she should leave as well, but he decides to stay after Marjorie and Elsa enter and woo him into staying. Roger Hopewell and Bernice Roth arrive and meet the performers, and the group gets started with their work.</p>
<p>After things get underway, Marjorie is murdered and the body of Helsa is discovered. After a series of dizzy conversations, multiple trips through secret doorways leading to a labyrinth of hidden passageways, a power outage in the mansion, multiple crimes, and criminals are revealed. Eventually after much murderous mayhem the Stage Door Slasher is revealed and captured through deciphering Bebe's coded notebook. It is revealed to be Ken the weird director.<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref></p>

<h2>Main characters[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Musical_Comedy_Murders_of_1940&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Main characters">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Helsa Wenzel[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Musical_Comedy_Murders_of_1940&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Helsa Wenzel">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Helsa is the <ref target="/wiki/Maid" title="Maid">maid</ref> of the Grossenknueten estate. She is killed in the first scene of the play, only to be <ref target="/wiki/Impersonator" title="Impersonator">impersonated</ref> by her homicidal <ref target="/wiki/Twin" title="Twin">twin</ref> brother, Dieter. The actress who plays Helsa also appears at the end of the play as "Katrina, the cook from Koblenz."</p>

<h3>Elsa Von Grossenknueten[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Musical_Comedy_Murders_of_1940&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Elsa Von Grossenknueten">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Elsa is the eccentric owner of the mansion and is the financial backer of many musicals. Elsa summons the group together in an attempt to find out who murdered her "friend" Bebe McAllister. She is extremely eccentric, and thinks that the idea of chasing after a killer is great fun. Her grandfather was a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spy" title="Spy">spy</ref>, and she claims that <ref target="/wiki/Espionage" title="Espionage">espionage</ref> runs in her blood.</p>

<h3>Michael Kelly[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Musical_Comedy_Murders_of_1940&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Michael Kelly">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Kelly is an undercover cop. Elsa appeals to him to help solve the mystery of the Stage Door Slasher, and Kelly at first pretends to be her butler. Kelly's tough, no-nonsense attitude puts him at odds with Elsa and the dramatic types that visit. He eventually reveals his identity as a New York police officer, much to Elsa's dismay. In the second act, he is kidnapped by an unseen figure and disappears into a <ref target="/wiki/Secret_passage" title="Secret passage">secret passage</ref>, and is later found with his hands tied a gag in his mouth. <ref target="/wiki/Willie_C._Carpenter" title="Willie C. Carpenter">Willie C. Carpenter</ref> was the first to play him.</p>

<h3>Patrick O'Reilly[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Musical_Comedy_Murders_of_1940&action=edit&section=7" title="Edit section: Patrick O'Reilly">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>O'Reilly claims to be an Irish <ref target="/wiki/Tenor" title="Tenor">tenor</ref>, but he is very suspicious, especially with regard to the mysterious Helsa. The two engage in a physical brawl. Eventually, O'Reilly claims to be "Tony Garibaldi", an undercover cop with a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bronx_accent" title="Bronx accent">Bronx accent</ref>-only to reveal himself as a <ref target="/wiki/Gestapo" title="Gestapo">Gestapo</ref> Agent named Klaus Stansdorff, sent to find German defectors. Nikki confronts him, but before he can reveal the truth, Helsa stabs him through a copy of <ref target="/wiki/Moby-Dick" title="Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</ref> in the second act, killing him. The original O'Reilly was played by Nicholas Wyman.</p>

<h3>Ken De La Maize[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Musical_Comedy_Murders_of_1940&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: Ken De La Maize">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>First played by Michael Ayr. Ken is a "typical" director, speaking of theater as a "pure art." He also has an annoying habit of name-dropping, constantly citing the various celebrities he has worked with over the years. Everyone always claims to have seen the films he makes, only for him to reveal that they have not yet been released. Ken is eventually revealed as the Stage Door Slasher, and explains that his hatred of ballet dancers stems from his father, who ran off with one and abandoned his mother. He attempts to kill Nikki, along with Elsa, Roger and Bernice. Eddie ends up thwarting him, and he is taken away to prison, rambling about how he knows <ref target="/wiki/Louella_Parsons" title="Louella Parsons">Louella Parsons</ref>.</p>

<h3>Nikki Crandall[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Musical_Comedy_Murders_of_1940&action=edit&section=9" title="Edit section: Nikki Crandall">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Originally played by <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dorothy_Cantwell" title="Dorothy Cantwell">Dorothy Cantwell</ref>. Nikki is considered a typical chorus girl-but she is eventually revealed to be <ref target="/wiki/Ensign_(rank)" title="Ensign (rank)">Ensign</ref> Nicole Crandall, of <ref target="/wiki/United_States_Navy" title="United States Navy">United States Naval Intelligence</ref>. Her secret mission was to find the Germans who were sent over to sabotage the American war efforts. She is also interested in solving the mystery of the Stage Door Slasher, and helps to break the code in Bebe's notebook. Ken almost kills her, followed quickly by Dieter Wenzel. Eddie saves her twice, prompting the two to fall in love at the end.</p>

<h3>Eddie McCuen[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Musical_Comedy_Murders_of_1940&action=edit&section=10" title="Edit section: Eddie McCuen">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Directly based on <ref target="/wiki/Bob_Hope" title="Bob Hope">Bob Hope</ref>, Eddie is the out of work comedian that ties the different story lines together, and goes from being cowardly at the beginning of the play to heroic at the end. He is attracted to Nikki, but fumbles when he tries to talk to her. He was a replacement for an actor, and thus has no connection to Manhattan Holiday. He is the one who realizes the connection between the Slasher case and the party, and later helps to defeat Ken and Dieter, both by knocking them out with a cognac bottle. These brave actions unite him with Nikki. He has an obvious attraction to Nikki throughout the whole play, and ultimately ends up saving the day and getting the girl. First played by Kelly Connell.</p>

<h3>Marjorie Baverstock[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Musical_Comedy_Murders_of_1940&action=edit&section=11" title="Edit section: Marjorie Baverstock">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Marjorie is a Broadway <ref target="/wiki/Theatrical_producer" title="Theatrical producer">producer</ref>. She constantly flatters everyone around her, and speaks in elevated language; her "new word" is "divoon." She is accidentally killed by Dieter at the end of the first act; strangely, no one seems to notice, despite the fact that there is an enormous sword through her back. Eddie, Ken and Kelly bury her dead body in a snowdrift in the beginning of the second act. Marjorie was first played by Pamela Dunlap.</p>

<h3>Roger Hopewell[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Musical_Comedy_Murders_of_1940&action=edit&section=12" title="Edit section: Roger Hopewell">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Originally played by Richard Seff. Roger is the <ref target="/wiki/Composer" title="Composer">composer</ref> for "White House Merry-Go-Round", and Bernice's partner; the two have had a string of Broadway hits. Roger enjoys teasing Ken about his artistic ways, and makes snide remarks throughout the play, but flares up whenever someone insults his musical style. He also knows how to deal with Bernice's many quirks. Towards the end of the play, Roger reveals a surprising knowledge of ciphers, and helps Nikki and Bernice break the code in Bebe's notebook.</p>

<h3>Bernice Roth[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Musical_Comedy_Murders_of_1940&action=edit&section=13" title="Edit section: Bernice Roth">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The <ref target="/wiki/Alcoholism" title="Alcoholism">perpetually thirsty</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Lyricist" title="Lyricist">lyricist</ref>, she is Roger's partner. Bernice is very odd and emotional, frequently losing her composure and screaming. When Marjorie fails to respond to the second act opening number of "White House Merry-Go-Round", Bernice is hugely offended, despite the fact that Marjorie was dead at the time. She spends the entire second act attempting to "fix" the play, even when she is held hostage by Ken, O'Reilly, and Dieter. In the finale, she is struck with inspiration toward a new work that takes place in the heartland of America – a cowboy play called <ref target="/wiki/Oklahoma!" title="Oklahoma!">Nebraska</ref>. This is a spoof on the play Oklahoma!. <ref target="/wiki/Bobo_Lewis" title="Bobo Lewis">Bobo Lewis</ref> originated the role.</p>
