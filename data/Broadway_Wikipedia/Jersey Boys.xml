<h2>Development[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Jersey_Boys&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Development">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>In the early 2000s, <ref target="/wiki/Bob_Gaudio" title="Bob Gaudio">Bob Gaudio</ref>, an original <ref target="/wiki/The_Four_Seasons_(band)" title="The Four Seasons (band)">Four Seasons</ref> member, sought to make a musical from the discography of the band. He hired book writers <ref target="/wiki/Rick_Elice" title="Rick Elice">Rick Elice</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Marshall_Brickman" title="Marshall Brickman">Marshall Brickman</ref>, and director <ref target="/wiki/Des_McAnuff" title="Des McAnuff">Des McAnuff</ref> (at the suggestion of <ref target="/wiki/Michael_David_(producer)" title="Michael David (producer)">Michael David</ref> of Dodger Theatricals). Brickman suggested creating a show about the band's history, instead of repurposing their songs for an independent story the way <ref target="/wiki/ABBA" title="ABBA">ABBA</ref> did with Mamma Mia!.<ref target="#cite_note-washingtonpost-1">[1]</ref> Brickman was drawn to the project because: "It's a classic American story. It's rags to riches, and back to rags."<ref target="#cite_note-nytimes2005-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>Little was known to the public about the group's history prior to the premiere of the musical, because the magazines of the era did not write much about them.<ref target="#cite_note-nytimes2005-2">[2]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-metro-3">[3]</ref> In their research, Brickman and Elice were surprised to find that the members had prison records, which might have prevented their music from being played if it had been publicized when they were active.<ref target="#cite_note-washingtonpost-1">[1]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-metro-3">[3]</ref> According to Gaudio, "Back then, things were a little clean-cut, don't forget, so the idea of our story getting out was horrifying to us."<ref target="#cite_note-telegraphUK-4">[4]</ref> Other bands of the time projected street-tough images, but The Four Seasons cleaned themselves up in order to be palatable for mainstream listeners.<ref target="#cite_note-nytimes2005-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>Brickman and Elice also used material from interviews with surviving Four Seasons members Gaudio, <ref target="/wiki/Frankie_Valli" title="Frankie Valli">Frankie Valli</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Tommy_DeVito_(musician)" title="Tommy DeVito (musician)">Tommy DeVito</ref>. While the Four Seasons as a group made headlines, as individuals they did not receive much press due to groups like <ref target="/wiki/The_Beatles" title="The Beatles">the Beatles</ref> receiving the attention.<ref target="#cite_note-baltimore_jewish_times-5">[5]</ref> Brickman noted that each member had his own perspective on what happened during their tenure as a group. Of the three, they approached DeVito last, who told them, "Don't listen to those guys. I'll tell you what really happened." Elice said that getting DeVito's version was a "eureka moment" and the contradiction in their stories ended up being incorporated in the musical for a <ref target="/wiki/Rashomon_effect" title="Rashomon effect">Rashomon effect</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-washingtonpost-1">[1]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-philly_article-6">[6]</ref> The writers were also contacted by family members of the late <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Boss_(crime)" title="Boss (crime)">mob boss</ref> <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gyp_DeCarlo" title="Gyp DeCarlo">Gyp DeCarlo</ref> to ensure that he would be portrayed respectfully.<ref target="#cite_note-telegraphUK-4">[4]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-dcpa201411-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>Although Gaudio was part of the initial development team, he wasn't involved in the creative process during tryouts, and only met the cast once the show had premiered.<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> Gaudio, Valli and DeVito had decided to step back from the show's creative process because they lacked objectivity, and they left it to Brickman, Elice and McAnuff to take the story to the stage.<ref target="#cite_note-metro-3">[3]</ref> However, Gaudio and Valli still had final say on whether to end the show if they didn't like it.<ref target="#cite_note-philly_article-6">[6]</ref></p>

<h2>Synopsis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Jersey_Boys&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Synopsis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Act I[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Jersey_Boys&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Act I">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Spring</p>
<p>"<ref target="/wiki/Ces_soir%C3%A9es-l%C3%A0" title="Ces soirées-là">Ces soirées-là</ref>", a modern pop-rap song that was released in 2000, is performed. Tommy DeVito arrives, introduces himself and explains how the song is a cover of The Four Seasons' "<ref target="/wiki/December,_1963_(Oh,_What_a_Night)" title="December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)">December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)</ref>". He offers to tell the story of the band, explaining how he started out with the group "The Variety Trio" with his brother Nick DeVito and friend Nick Massi, eventually discovering teenager Frankie Castelluccio and taking him under his wing, teaching him everything he knows ("The Early Years: A Scrapbook"). During these early years Nick Massi helped train Frankie to sing, Tommy went in and out of prison, Frankie changed his last name to Valli, Tommy and Frankie developed a good relationship with mob boss Gyp DeCarlo, and Frankie fell in love with and married Mary Delgado. Musically, the band was still struggling and kept changing their name and sound but without any dramatic success. One day friend and fellow Jersey boy <ref target="/wiki/Joe_Pesci" title="Joe Pesci">Joe Pesci</ref> comes up to Tommy and says that he knows a singer-songwriter who'd make the perfect fourth for their band: Bob Gaudio.</p>

<p>Summer</p>
<p>Bob Gaudio takes over the narration, telling the audience that no matter what Tommy says, he wasn't plucked from obscurity by him, since he already had a hit single with "<ref target="/wiki/Short_Shorts" title="Short Shorts">Short Shorts</ref>". Bob goes with <ref target="/wiki/Joe_Pesci" title="Joe Pesci">Joe Pesci</ref> to see the band perform, and is immediately impressed by Frankie's voice. Bob performs a song he'd just written: "Cry for Me" on piano, which Frankie, Nick Massi and then Tommy joining in with vocals, bass and guitar respectively. They negotiate an agreement, though Tommy is at first skeptical that Bobby (then still a teenager) will be good for the band. The band eventually gets a contract with producer Bob Crewe but only to sing back-up ("Backup Sessions"). Crewe insists that the band has an "identity crisis" and needs to make a firm decision on a name and a sound. The band name themselves after The Four Seasons bowling alley, and Bobby writes them three songs that finally propel them to stardom: "<ref target="/wiki/Sherry_(song)" title="Sherry (song)">Sherry</ref>", "<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Big_Girls_Don%27t_Cry_(The_Four_Seasons_song)" title="Big Girls Don't Cry (The Four Seasons song)">Big Girls Don't Cry</ref>" and "<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Walk_Like_a_Man_(The_Four_Seasons_song)" title="Walk Like a Man (The Four Seasons song)">Walk Like a Man</ref>". In the wake of their success, Bob also chalks up a personal first by losing his virginity ("<ref target="/wiki/December,_1963_(Oh,_What_a_Night)" title="December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)">December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)</ref>"). The band's success means that they tour a lot more, along the way discovering the girl band <ref target="/wiki/The_Angels_(American_group)" title="The Angels (American group)">The Angels</ref> ("<ref target="/wiki/My_Boyfriend%27s_Back_(song)" title="My Boyfriend's Back (song)">My Boyfriend's Back</ref>"). Unfortunately, the constant touring strains Frankie's marriage to Mary, and they eventually divorce ("<ref target="/wiki/My_Eyes_Adored_You" title="My Eyes Adored You">My Eyes Adored You</ref>"). The band continues to enjoy chart successes ("<ref target="/wiki/Dawn_(Go_Away)" title="Dawn (Go Away)">Dawn (Go Away)</ref>") until after a concert the band is approached by a loan shark out to claim money owed by Tommy ("Walk Like a Man (reprise)").</p>

<h3>Act II[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Jersey_Boys&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Act II">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Fall</p>
<p>Nick Massi, taking over as Narrator, explains that Bob was so focused on the band's musical success and future that he couldn't see that the band had been in trouble for some time. Tommy's been racking up debts, and a forgotten bill during a previous tour lands the band in jail over the weekend, which strains things between Tommy and Bob ("<ref target="/wiki/Big_Man_in_Town" title="Big Man in Town">Big Man in Town</ref>"). Nick observes that Tommy became jealous of Frankie's success and closeness with Bobby, and attempted to seduce Frankie's new girlfriend Lorraine. The two never confronted each other about it, but the old friendship was not what it used to be. When the loan shark approaches the band for the $150,000 owed by Tommy, Frankie goes to Gyp DeCarlo for help despite Tommy's insistence that he doesn't need it ("<ref target="/wiki/Beggin%27" title="Beggin'">Beggin'</ref>"). The band, Gyp, and the loan shark come to agreement: Tommy is to be "sequestered" in Las Vegas where the mob can keep an eye on him, and the band will willingly cover the debt, along with an additional half a million in unpaid taxes that Tommy kept hidden from the group. At this time, Nick declares that he's tired of everything and wants out, despite Frankie and Bob trying to convince him to stay ("<ref target="/wiki/Stay_(Maurice_Williams_song)" title="Stay (Maurice Williams song)">Stay</ref>/<ref target="/wiki/Let%27s_Hang_On!" title="Let's Hang On!">Let's Hang On!</ref>").</p>

<p>Winter</p>
<p>Frankie takes over narration, explaining that though he owes Tommy a great deal, he's aware that their relationship wasn't ideal, and he never understood why Nick decided to leave. Frankie and Bob find replacements to keep the band a quartet ("<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Opus_17_(Don%27t_You_Worry_%27Bout_Me)" title="Opus 17 (Don't You Worry 'Bout Me)">Opus 17 (Don't You Worry 'Bout Me)</ref>") until Bobby announces that he's never been comfortable in the spotlight and that Frankie should be a single, i.e. Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. In his personal life, Frankie's relationship with his daughter Francine is strained and he breaks up with girlfriend Lorraine ("<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bye,_Bye,_Baby_(Baby,_Goodbye)" title="Bye, Bye, Baby (Baby, Goodbye)">Bye, Bye, Baby (Baby, Goodbye)</ref>"). Frankie continues to have success thanks to Bobby's songs, and hits jackpot with "<ref target="/wiki/C%27mon_Marianne" title="C'mon Marianne">C'mon Marianne</ref>" and the almost-never-released "<ref target="/wiki/Can%27t_Take_My_Eyes_Off_You" title="Can't Take My Eyes Off You">Can't Take My Eyes Off You</ref>" which Bobby fights to get airplay for. Along with the success of "<ref target="/wiki/Working_My_Way_Back_to_You" title="Working My Way Back to You">Working My Way Back to You</ref>", Frankie and Bobby finally finish paying off Tommy's debts, and Frankie's life is good until his daughter Francine dies from a drug overdose ("Fallen Angel")</p>

<p>Finale</p>
<p>Bob Crewe describes The Four Seasons' 1990 induction into the <ref target="/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" title="Rock and Roll Hall of Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</ref>, which reunited the original four members on stage one last time ("<ref target="/wiki/Rag_Doll_(Four_Seasons_song)" title="Rag Doll (Four Seasons song)">Rag Doll</ref>"). Each member takes a moment to address the audience in turn, explaining his pride at having been with the band and briefly notes what he did afterwards ("<ref target="/wiki/Who_Loves_You_(song)" title="Who Loves You (song)">Who Loves You</ref>").</p>
