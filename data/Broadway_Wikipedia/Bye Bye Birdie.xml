<h2>History[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Bye_Bye_Birdie&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: History">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The producer <ref target="/wiki/Edward_Padula" title="Edward Padula">Edward Padula</ref> had the idea for a musical initially titled Let's Go Steady, a "happy teenage musical with a difference". Padula contracted with two writers, and <ref target="/wiki/Charles_Strouse" title="Charles Strouse">Charles Strouse</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Lee_Adams" title="Lee Adams">Lee Adams</ref> wrote seven songs for their libretto. Padula, Strouse and Adams sought <ref target="/wiki/Gower_Champion" title="Gower Champion">Gower Champion</ref> as director/choreographer, who until that time had choreographed only a few musicals. (<ref target="/wiki/Fred_Astaire" title="Fred Astaire">Fred Astaire</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Morton_DaCosta" title="Morton DaCosta">Morton DaCosta</ref> had already declined). However, Champion did not like the book and the writers were fired, with <ref target="/wiki/Michael_Stewart_(playwright)" title="Michael Stewart (playwright)">Michael Stewart</ref> then hired. Stewart wrote an early version titled Love and Kisses, which focused on a couple thinking of divorce, but whose children persuade them to stay together.</p>
<p>Champion wanted "something more". "The 'something more' had been right there in the newspaper. Rock-and-roll idol <ref target="/wiki/Elvis_Presley" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</ref> was <ref target="/wiki/Conscription" title="Conscription">drafted</ref> into the army in September 1957 and soon left the US for eighteen months in Germany, provoking a media circus that included Elvis giving a specially selected member of the <ref target="/wiki/Women%27s_Army_Corps" title="Women's Army Corps">Women's Army Corps</ref> 'one last kiss'.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>] After brainstorming, Stewart and Adams "came up with the idea of a rock-and-roll singer going off to the army and its effect on a group of teenagers in a small town in Ohio. The name of the singer initially was 'Ellsworth', which was soon changed to 'Conway Twitty' before we discovered there was already a <ref target="/wiki/Conway_Twitty" title="Conway Twitty">Conway Twitty</ref> who was threatening to sue us, and then, finally, 'Conrad Birdie'".<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref></p>

<h2>Synopsis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Bye_Bye_Birdie&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Synopsis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Act one[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Bye_Bye_Birdie&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Act one">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>New York–based songwriter Albert Peterson finds himself in trouble when his client, hip-thrusting <ref target="/wiki/Rock_and_roll" title="Rock and roll">rock and roll</ref> superstar and <ref target="/wiki/Teen_idol" title="Teen idol">teen idol</ref> Conrad Birdie, is drafted into the <ref target="/wiki/United_States_Army" title="United States Army">Army</ref>, leaving his heavily indebted firm in jeopardy. Albert's secretary, Rose "Rosie" Alvarez, comes up with a last-ditch publicity stunt to have Conrad Birdie record and perform a song before he is sent overseas. Having long been stuck in a sort of romantic limbo for eight years, she longs for the Albert she once knew, an aspiring English teacher, before he wrote Conrad Birdie's first hit and abandoned those plans to pursue the seedier music industry ("An English Teacher"). Rose's plan is to have Birdie sing "One Last Kiss" (a song she assigns Albert to write on the spot) and give one lucky girl, chosen randomly from his fan club, a real "last kiss" on <ref target="/wiki/The_Ed_Sullivan_Show" title="The Ed Sullivan Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</ref> before going into the Army.</p>
<p>In Sweet Apple, <ref target="/wiki/Ohio" title="Ohio">Ohio</ref>, all the teenagers are catching in on the latest gossip about 15-year-old Kim MacAfee and Hugo Peabody going steady ("The Telephone Hour"). Kim reflects on how happy she is with her maturity, believing at 15 she has fully reached adulthood ("How Lovely to Be a Woman"). She quits the Conrad Birdie fan club over the phone because of the new milestone happening in her life. Her best friend Ursula is shocked. Kim reconsiders when, after a lengthy phone conversation with Ursula, she receives the phone call telling her she has been chosen to be Birdie's last kiss before going into the armed forces.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Conrad, Albert, and Rosie prepare to go to Sweet Apple. A crowd of teenage girls sees them off at the New York City train station, although one girl is sad because she thinks that by the time Conrad gets out of the army, she will be too old for him. Albert advises her to be optimistic ("Put on a Happy Face"). Soon, tabloid reporters arrive with questions about the seedy details of Conrad's personal life, but Rosie, Albert, and the girls answer for him, hoping to protect his reputation and <ref target="/wiki/Bankable_star" title="Bankable star">bankability</ref> ("Normal American Boy").<ref target="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGilliland1969show_8,_track_2-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>Conrad receives a hero's welcome in Sweet Apple, and Hugo worries that Kim likes Conrad more than she likes him, but Kim assures Hugo that he is the only one she loves ("One Boy"). Conrad shocks the town's parents and drives the teenage girls crazy with his performance of "Honestly Sincere", which causes all of the girls (including Edna, the mayor's wife) to faint. Conrad becomes a guest in the MacAfee house and irritates Kim's father, Harry, by being rude and selfish. Harry does not want Kim to kiss Conrad, until Albert tells him their whole family will be on The Ed Sullivan Show. Kim, Harry, Kim's mother, Doris, and younger brother, Randolph sing Sullivan's praises ("Hymn for a Sunday Evening"<ref target="#cite_note-pc7-5">[5]</ref>).</p>
<p>Albert's overbearing mother, Mae, comes to Sweet Apple to break up her son's relationship with Rosie (she objects to Rosie's <ref target="/wiki/Hispanic" title="Hispanic">Hispanic</ref> heritage). She introduces Albert to Gloria Rasputin, a curvy blonde she met on the bus who could replace Rosie as his secretary. Gloria, a tap dancer, secretly hopes that a connection with Albert could be her way into show business. Mae sings "<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Swanee_River_(song)" title="Swanee River (song)">Swanee River</ref>" as Gloria tap-dances (usually depicted as her making a fool of herself). Albert gives Gloria a typing job. Rosie is furious and fantasizes about violent ways to murder Albert ("One Hundred Ways Ballet"), but instead comes up with a better idea: she convinces Hugo to sabotage the last kiss.</p>
<p>Since both Rosie and Hugo are jealous and angry, they plot to ruin Conrad's appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. On the broadcast, Conrad sings "One Last Kiss" and as he leans in to kiss Kim, Hugo runs onstage and punches him in the face, knocking Conrad unconscious. Rosie dumps Albert, and Albert, trying to cover for the mishaps of the evening, leads a chorus of "Normal American Boy".</p>

<h3>Act two[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Bye_Bye_Birdie&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Act two">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Despite plans to re-film the broadcast, Rosie and Kim resolve to leave Albert and Hugo, lamenting their stupidity for having fallen in love ("What Did I Ever See in Him?"). Conrad, with no visible effects from being knocked out, decides he wants to go out and have a good time on his last night as a civilian, and encourages the Sweet Apple teens to party ("A Lot of Livin' to Do"). Kim sneaks out of her house and joins her friends. Conrad, Kim, and all the teenagers, except Hugo, head for the Ice House, "where people go when they want to be alone." Hugo goes to Maude's Roadside Retreat, hoping to get drunk, but grumpy proprietor Charles F. Maude sees that he's underage and refuses to serve him.</p>
<p>When Harry discovers Kim has run away, he and Doris lament how disobedient kids are these days ("Kids"). Rosie ends up at Maude's Roadside Retreat and starts flirting with other men, but Albert phones her and begs her to return to him ("Baby, Talk to Me"). Rosie interrupts a <ref target="/wiki/Shriners" title="Shriners">Shriners</ref> meeting in Maude's private dining room. She flirts with all the Shriners, and they begin a wild dance. Hugo and Albert rescue Rosie from the crazed Shriners, and Albert finally stands up to his mother, telling her to go home. Mae leaves, but not before lamenting the sacrifices she made for him ("A Mother Doesn't Matter Anymore"). Hugo tells the MacAfees and the other parents that the teenagers have gone to the Ice House, and they all declare that they don't know what's wrong with their kids ("Kids Reprise"). Randolph joins in, stating that his older sister and the other teens are "so ridiculous and so immature".</p>
<p>The adults and the police arrive at the Ice House and arrest Conrad for attempted <ref target="/wiki/Statutory_rape" title="Statutory rape">statutory rape</ref>. Kim, who unconvincingly claimed to be in her late 20s to Conrad, claims she was intimidated and gladly returns to Hugo. After a reconciliation with Albert, Rosie tells Mae that she will marry Albert despite Mae's racist objections, and despite being a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Natural_born_citizen" title="Natural born citizen">natural-born American citizen</ref> from <ref target="/wiki/Allentown,_Pennsylvania" title="Allentown, Pennsylvania">Allentown, Pennsylvania</ref>, she will deliberately play up her Hispanic heritage if it annoys Mae that much ("Spanish Rose"). Albert bails Conrad out of jail and arranges for him to sneak out of town dressed as a middle-aged woman, presumably so he can report for Army induction as scheduled; in turn, Conrad offers Albert a lifetime contract for bailing him out. Albert gets Mae to leave Sweet Apple on the same train, getting Conrad and his mother out of his life for good. Albert tells Rosie they're not going back to New York; they're going to Pumpkin Falls, <ref target="/wiki/Iowa" title="Iowa">Iowa</ref>, a small town in need of a (married) English teacher. Albert professes that everything is rosy with Rosie ("Rosie"), and they go off together happily engaged.</p>

<h2>Film and television adaptations[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Bye_Bye_Birdie&action=edit&section=15" title="Edit section: Film and television adaptations">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>1963 film[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Bye_Bye_Birdie&action=edit&section=16" title="Edit section: 1963 film">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Main article: <ref target="/wiki/Bye_Bye_Birdie_(film)" title="Bye Bye Birdie (film)">Bye Bye Birdie (film)</ref></p>
<p>Bye Bye Birdie was first adapted for film in 1963. It starred <ref target="/wiki/Dick_Van_Dyke" title="Dick Van Dyke">Dick Van Dyke</ref> reprising his stage role as a slightly rewritten Albert Peterson, <ref target="/wiki/Maureen_Stapleton" title="Maureen Stapleton">Maureen Stapleton</ref> as Mama Mae Peterson, <ref target="/wiki/Janet_Leigh" title="Janet Leigh">Janet Leigh</ref> as Rosie, <ref target="/wiki/Paul_Lynde" title="Paul Lynde">Paul Lynde</ref> reprising his stage role as Mr. MacAfee, <ref target="/wiki/Bobby_Rydell" title="Bobby Rydell">Bobby Rydell</ref> as Hugo Peabody, and <ref target="/wiki/Ann-Margret" title="Ann-Margret">Ann-Margret</ref> as Kim MacAfee. <ref target="/wiki/Jesse_Pearson_(actor)" title="Jesse Pearson (actor)">Jesse Pearson</ref> played Conrad Birdie.<ref target="#cite_note-23">[23]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Ed_Sullivan" title="Ed Sullivan">Ed Sullivan</ref> makes a guest appearance as himself. The film is credited with making Ann-Margret a superstar during the mid-1960s, leading to her appearing with the real <ref target="/wiki/Elvis_Presley" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/Viva_Las_Vegas" title="Viva Las Vegas">Viva Las Vegas</ref> (1964). The film ranked number 38 on <ref target="/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</ref>'s list of the 50 Best High School Movies.<ref target="#cite_note-24">[24]</ref></p>
<p>Several significant changes were made in the plot and character relationships in the film version. Albert is not Birdie's agent but a talented research chemist who is struggling as a songwriter only to please his mother, who is overbearing and insensitive, but not racist as in the musical. He contributed to Birdie's initial success, and therefore Birdie "owes" him a favor. The film version includes an additional character, a suave English teacher who flirts with Rosie. She plays up to him in several scenes after Albert has made her angry by caving in to his mother. The positioning and context of several songs were changed as well. "An English Teacher", "Normal American Boy", "One Hundred Ways", "What Did I Ever See In Him?", "Baby, Talk To Me", and "Spanish Rose", were omitted from the film. "Kids" was performed in the MacAfee kitchen by Mr. MacAfee, Mama Mae Peterson, Albert, and Randolph. "Put On A Happy Face" is performed by Albert and Rosie in the MacAfees' back yard; "A Lot of Livin' To Do" was performed by Conrad, Kim, and Hugo at a teen dance; and "Rosie" is sung at the end of show by Albert, Rosie, Hugo, and Kim. Kim also opens and closes the film version singing the title song, "Bye Bye, Birdie", a song written for the film. The film version ends on a brighter and lighter note than the stage musical. Conrad is not arrested but Hugo knocks him out with a single punch "live" on The Ed Sullivan Show and wins Kim's heart. Thus, there is no necessity for Albert to bail Conrad out of jail and arrange for him to sneak out of town dressed as a middle-aged woman, presumably so he can report for Army induction as scheduled. There is also no need for Conrad to offer Albert a lifetime contract for bailing him out. Albert's mother shows up after the broadcast with Charles F. Maude (the bartender), informs Albert and Rosie that she has married him, and gives Albert and Rosie her blessing for their long-postponed wedding.</p>
<p>Van Dyke and other members of the Broadway production were unhappy with the film adaptation due to the focus shift to Kim. Van Dyke stated that Birdie was "a romp'" on Broadway, but they "Hollywood-ized" the movie. "They made it a vehicle for <ref target="/wiki/Ann-Margret" title="Ann-Margret">Ann-Margret</ref>."<ref target="#cite_note-25">[25]</ref> Paul Lynde, who played Mr. MacAfee on stage and in the film, later quipped "They should have retitled it 'Hello, Ann-Margret!' They cut several of my and the other actors' best scenes and shot new ones for her so she could do her teenage-sex-bombshell act."<ref target="#cite_note-26">[26]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Susan_Watson" title="Susan Watson">Susan Watson</ref>, who created the role of Kim on Broadway, later said, "Anyone who likes the film didn't see the show."<ref target="#cite_note-27">[27]</ref> In January 2009, <ref target="/wiki/Adam_Shankman" title="Adam Shankman">Adam Shankman</ref> signed on to develop and produce a remake.<ref target="#cite_note-28">[28]</ref></p>

<h3>1995 TV movie[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Bye_Bye_Birdie&action=edit&section=17" title="Edit section: 1995 TV movie">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>A <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/TV-movie" title="TV-movie">TV-movie</ref> adaptation was produced for <ref target="/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</ref> in 1995 by <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/RHI_Entertainment" title="RHI Entertainment">RHI Entertainment</ref>. It starred <ref target="/wiki/Jason_Alexander" title="Jason Alexander">Jason Alexander</ref> in the role of Albert and <ref target="/wiki/Vanessa_Williams" title="Vanessa Williams">Vanessa Williams</ref> as Rosie. <ref target="/wiki/Tyne_Daly" title="Tyne Daly">Tyne Daly</ref> played Mae Peterson. <ref target="/wiki/Marc_Kudisch" title="Marc Kudisch">Marc Kudisch</ref>, who played Conrad Birdie on tour opposite <ref target="/wiki/Tommy_Tune" title="Tommy Tune">Tommy Tune</ref>, reprised the role. <ref target="/wiki/Chynna_Phillips" title="Chynna Phillips">Chynna Phillips</ref> played Kim MacAfee, <ref target="/wiki/Sally_Mayes" title="Sally Mayes">Sally Mayes</ref> played Mrs. MacAfee and <ref target="/wiki/George_Wendt" title="George Wendt">George Wendt</ref> played Harry MacAfee. While this version remained mostly faithful to the original musical (Michael Stewart remains the only credited author of this version), several songs were added and re-arranged, and dialogue was slightly rewritten to smoothly facilitate the musical changes. The title song "Bye Bye Birdie", written for the 1963 film and sung by <ref target="/wiki/Ann-Margret" title="Ann-Margret">Ann-Margret</ref>, is re-arranged and rewritten as a quintet for Ursula and the Sweet Apple Birdie fan club girls at the soda shop. The verse of "One Boy" that Rosie sings was replaced with "Let's Settle Down". The "How to Kill a Man" ballet was cut. "What Did I Ever See in Him?" is given a reprise sung by Albert, called "What Did I Ever See in Her?". The song "Baby, Talk to Me" returns to the show. "Spanish Rose" is moved to earlier in the story. "A Mother Doesn't Matter Anymore", sung by Mae Peterson, has always been part of the stage productions but was cut from the 1963 film, possibly because actress <ref target="/wiki/Maureen_Stapleton" title="Maureen Stapleton">Maureen Stapleton</ref> was not a singer.<ref target="#cite_note-29">[29]</ref> Albert tells Rosie how he has finally broken free of his overbearing mother In "A Giant Step". This song was written for the 1990 US tour.<ref target="#cite_note-30">[30]</ref></p>

<h3>Bye Bye Birdie Live![<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Bye_Bye_Birdie&action=edit&section=18" title="Edit section: Bye Bye Birdie Live!">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>On October 27, 2016 it was announced that <ref target="/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez" title="Jennifer Lopez">Jennifer Lopez</ref> will star in NBC's Bye Bye Birdie Live as Rose "Rosie" Alvarez<ref target="#cite_note-:0-31">[31]</ref> and executive produce with her producing partners Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and Benny Medina alongside film, TV, and live musical executive producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron.<ref target="#cite_note-32">[32]</ref> The live television musical was initially announced to premiere in December 2017,<ref target="#cite_note-33">[33]</ref> but on May 25, 2017, it was announced that it would be pushed to sometime in 2018 to accommodate Lopez's busy schedule.<ref target="#cite_note-34">[34]</ref> On March 2, 2018, it was announced that the production had been pushed back once again, this time to 2019 at the earliest due to Lopez's busy schedule and the producers focusing on <ref target="/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar_Live_in_Concert" title="Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert">Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-35">[35]</ref></p>
<p>NBC had announced in May 2018 to broadcast a live production of <ref target="/wiki/Hair_(musical)" title="Hair (musical)">Hair</ref> but canceled those plans in the wake of the failure of <ref target="/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">Fox</ref>'s <ref target="/wiki/Rent:_Live" title="Rent: Live">Rent: Live</ref> in early 2019.

<h2>Critical reception[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Bye_Bye_Birdie&action=edit&section=19" title="Edit section: Critical reception">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The original production of Bye Bye Birdie opened to mostly positive reviews, with several critics marveling at the unexpected success of a musical crafted by an inexperienced production team. John Champman of the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Daily_News_(New_York)" title="Daily News (New York)">New York Daily News</ref> called it "the funniest, most captivating, and most expert musical comedy one could hope to see ... the show is pure, plain musical comedy, with jokes, dancing, oddball costumes ... exceptionally catching orchestrations ... and a completely enthusiastic cast." He noted that "one of the best things about it is that practically nobody is connected to it. Who ever heard of Edward Padula ... Charles Strouse and Lee Adams ... Gower Champion?"<ref target="#cite_note-Suskin-37">[37]</ref></p>
<p>Frank Aston of the <ref target="/wiki/New_York_World-Telegram" title="New York World-Telegram">New York World-Telegram & Sun</ref> declared Bye Bye Birdie "the peak of the season" and especially liked <ref target="/wiki/Chita_Rivera" title="Chita Rivera">Chita Rivera</ref> as Rosie: "Chita Rivera ... is triumphant as dancer, comic, and warbler."<ref target="#cite_note-Suskin-37">[37]</ref> In the <ref target="/wiki/New_York_Daily_Mirror" title="New York Daily Mirror">New York Daily Mirror</ref>, Robert Coleman wrote that "Edward Padula put over a sleeper in the Broadway sweepstakes, and it's going to pay off in big figures ... Rivera explodes like a bomb over West 45th Street. Michael Stewart has penned a sassy and fresh book, while Lee Adams and Charles Strouse have matched it with tongue-in-cheek lyrics and music."<ref target="#cite_note-Suskin-37">[37]</ref></p>
<ref target="/wiki/New_York_Herald_Tribune" title="New York Herald Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</ref> critic Walter Kerr praised Gower Champion's direction but criticized the libretto and score, stating that "Mr. Champion has been very much responsible for the gayety (sic), the winsomeness, and the exuberant zing of the occasion ... he has not always been given the very best to work with ... every once in a while, Michael Stewart's book starts to break down and cry ... Lee Adams's lyrics lean rather heavily on the new "talk-out-the-plot" technique, and Charles Strouse's tunes, though jaunty, are whisper-thin."<ref target="#cite_note-Suskin-37">[37]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Brooks_Atkinson" title="Brooks Atkinson">Brooks Atkinson</ref> of <ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref> conceded that "the audience was beside itself with pleasure" but dryly stated that "this department was able to contain itself. Bye Bye Birdie is neither fish, fowl, nor good musical comedy. It needs work."<ref target="#cite_note-Suskin-37">[37]</ref>
