<p>110 in the Shade is a <ref target="/wiki/Musical_theatre" title="Musical theatre">musical</ref> with a book by <ref target="/wiki/N._Richard_Nash" title="N. Richard Nash">N. Richard Nash</ref>, lyrics by <ref target="/wiki/Tom_Jones_(writer)" title="Tom Jones (writer)">Tom Jones</ref>, and music by <ref target="/wiki/Harvey_Schmidt" title="Harvey Schmidt">Harvey Schmidt</ref>.</p>
<p>Based on Nash's 1954 play <ref target="/wiki/The_Rainmaker_(play)" title="The Rainmaker (play)">The Rainmaker</ref>, it focuses on Lizzie Curry, a <ref target="/wiki/Spinster" title="Spinster">spinster</ref> living on a <ref target="/wiki/Ranch" title="Ranch">ranch</ref> in the <ref target="/wiki/Southwestern_United_States" title="Southwestern United States">American southwest</ref>, and her relationships with local <ref target="/wiki/Sheriff" title="Sheriff">sheriff</ref> File, a cautious <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Divorc%C3%A9" title="Divorcé">divorcé</ref> who fears being hurt again, and charismatic <ref target="/wiki/Confidence_trick" title="Confidence trick">con man</ref> Bill Starbuck, posing as a <ref target="/wiki/Rainmaking" title="Rainmaking">rainmaker</ref> who promises the locals he can bring relief to the drought-stricken area. Nash's book is faithful to his original play, although all the interior scenes were moved outdoors to allow for the addition of townspeople for ensemble numbers and dances. Many of Jones' lyrics come directly from Nash's play.</p>

<h3>Original Broadway Production[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=110_in_the_Shade&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Original Broadway Production">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Following the success of <ref target="/wiki/The_Fantasticks" title="The Fantasticks">The Fantasticks</ref>, the project was the composing team's first for <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref>. The original score was almost <ref target="/wiki/Opera" title="Opera">operatic</ref> in scope, and when the show's running time in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</ref> proved to be too long, the creative team began trimming numbers,<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref> eventually discarding nearly as many as were heard in the finished product. After two previews, the production, directed by <ref target="/wiki/Joseph_Anthony" title="Joseph Anthony">Joseph Anthony</ref> and <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Choreographed" title="Choreographed">choreographed</ref> by <ref target="/wiki/Agnes_de_Mille" title="Agnes de Mille">Agnes de Mille</ref>, opened on October 24, 1963, at the <ref target="/wiki/Broadhurst_Theatre" title="Broadhurst Theatre">Broadhurst Theatre</ref>, where it ran for 330 performances. The cast included <ref target="/wiki/Robert_Horton_(actor)" title="Robert Horton (actor)">Robert Horton</ref> as Starbuck, <ref target="/wiki/Inga_Swenson" title="Inga Swenson">Inga Swenson</ref> as Lizzie, and <ref target="/wiki/Stephen_Douglass" title="Stephen Douglass">Stephen Douglass</ref> as File, with <ref target="/wiki/Will_Geer" title="Will Geer">Will Geer</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Lesley_Ann_Warren" title="Lesley Ann Warren">Lesley Ann Warren</ref>, and <ref target="/wiki/Gretchen_Cryer" title="Gretchen Cryer">Gretchen Cryer</ref> in supporting roles. The sets were by <ref target="/wiki/Oliver_Smith_(designer)" title="Oliver Smith (designer)">Oliver Smith</ref> and costumes by <ref target="/wiki/Motley" title="Motley">Motley</ref>. The show received four <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Award" title="Tony Award">Tony Award</ref> nominations but won none. <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/RCA_Victor" title="RCA Victor">RCA Victor</ref> released an original Broadway cast recording of this production on November 3, 1963, one recording in stereo; one in mono. Both recordings were identical; each having 16 tracks. RCA Victor also released the recording on Compact Disc on June 12, 1990, with one track--"Overture" not heard on the previous LP recordings.<ref target="#cite_note-castalbums.org-2">[2]</ref></p>

<h3>Original London Production[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=110_in_the_Shade&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Original London Production">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The first and only <ref target="/wiki/West_End_theatre" title="West End theatre">West End</ref> production, directed by Charles Blackwell, recreated the original Broadway production closely and opened on February 8, 1967, at the <ref target="/wiki/Palace_Theatre,_London" title="Palace Theatre, London">Palace Theatre</ref>, where it ran for 101 performances.<ref target="#cite_note-guide-3">[3]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-4">[4]</ref></p>

<h3>1992 New York City Opera Revival[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=110_in_the_Shade&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: 1992 New York City Opera Revival">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>A 1992 <ref target="/wiki/New_York_City_Opera" title="New York City Opera">New York City Opera</ref> production, directed by <ref target="/wiki/Scott_Ellis" title="Scott Ellis">Scott Ellis</ref> and choreographed by <ref target="/wiki/Susan_Stroman" title="Susan Stroman">Susan Stroman</ref>, starred <ref target="/wiki/Karen_Ziemba" title="Karen Ziemba">Karen Ziemba</ref> as Lizzie. The score was heard to particular advantage here, as the opera company orchestra was appreciably larger than the conventional Broadway pit orchestra.<ref target="#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> A 2-CD studio recording released by Jay Records on October 21, 1997, features Ziemba, <ref target="/wiki/Walter_Charles" title="Walter Charles">Walter Charles</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Ron_Raines" title="Ron Raines">Ron Raines</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Kristin_Chenoweth" title="Kristin Chenoweth">Kristin Chenoweth</ref>, and Schmidt and Jones.<ref target="#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> The recording was based on the 1992 New York City Opera production, and includes five bonus tracks from the New York City Opera production.<ref target="#cite_note-castalbums.org-2">[2]</ref></p>

<h3>1999 Concert Production[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=110_in_the_Shade&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: 1999 Concert Production">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>In 1999, a concert version was staged at the <ref target="/wiki/Fortune_Theatre" title="Fortune Theatre">Fortune Theatre</ref> in London by Ian Marshall Fisher for the Discovering Lost Musicals Charitable Trust, with <ref target="/wiki/Louise_Gold" title="Louise Gold">Louise Gold</ref> as Lizzie. For this production only a piano accompaniment was used, and the cast was unmiked.<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>

<h3>2007 Broadway revival[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=110_in_the_Shade&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: 2007 Broadway revival">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roundabout_Theater_Company" title="Roundabout Theater Company">Roundabout Theater Company</ref> presented a new production of the show, which opened on May 9, 2007, at <ref target="/wiki/Studio_54" title="Studio 54">Studio 54</ref>, and closed on July 29, 2007, after 94 performances and 27 previews. The production team was headed by director <ref target="/wiki/Lonny_Price" title="Lonny Price">Lonny Price</ref> and designer <ref target="/wiki/Santo_Loquasto" title="Santo Loquasto">Santo Loquasto</ref>. They were joined by lighting designer <ref target="/wiki/Christopher_Akerlind" title="Christopher Akerlind">Christopher Akerlind</ref>, sound designer <ref target="/wiki/Dan_Moses_Schreier" title="Dan Moses Schreier">Dan Moses Schreier</ref>, and musical arranger David Krane along with musical supervisor/director, <ref target="/wiki/Paul_Gemignani" title="Paul Gemignani">Paul Gemignani</ref>, who has worked closely with Price on various stage projects in the past.

Curry.

Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to the Roundabout Theater Company revival of '110 in the Shade' that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. Ravishing of voice and Olympian of stature, she’s an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show."<ref target="#cite_note-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>The revival also garnered four additional Tony nominations, but failed to win any. In June 2010, McDonald reprised her Tony-nominated role in a two-week fundraising production of the show for the <ref class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Hale_Center_Theater&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Hale Center Theater (page does not exist)">Hale Center Theater</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/Orem,_Utah" title="Orem, Utah">Orem, Utah</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> A recording of this production was released on June 12, 2007, by <ref target="/wiki/PS_Classics" title="PS Classics">PS Classics</ref>.

<h3>Act I[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=110_in_the_Shade&action=edit&section=9" title="Edit section: Act I">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>It's the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fourth_of_July" title="Fourth of July">Fourth of July</ref> in 1936, in the small town of Three Point in the Southwestern U.S., where a blistering heat wave has the local <ref target="/wiki/Sheriff" title="Sheriff">sheriff</ref>, File, and the other townsfolk forever eyeing the sky ("Another Hot Day"). Elsewhere in town, on the <ref target="/wiki/Ranch" title="Ranch">ranch</ref> of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Widower" title="Widower">widower</ref> H.C. Curry, the air is also charged with anticipation, due to the imminent arrival of H.C.'s daughter ("Lizzie's Coming Home"), who's been off visiting friends of the family (pseudo-relatives "Uncle" Ned and "Aunt" Marabelle and their sons) in [Sweetwater]. The trip was designed to find Lizzie a husband, but to no avail: as at home, her intelligence, sharp wit, and insecurities proved her undoing. H.C. and his sons, Jim and Noah, hatch a plan to invite Sheriff File to the annual <ref target="/wiki/Picnic" title="Picnic">picnic</ref> lunch, where Lizzie can impress him with her prettiest party dress and tastiest picnic basket. Reluctant at first, but then allowing herself to dream just a bit, Lizzie agrees ("Love Don't Turn Away").</p>
<p>Sheriff File, unfortunately, proves immune to every enticement the Curry boys offer ("Poker Polka"). His mind is more on "some sort of <ref target="/wiki/Outlaw" title="Outlaw">outlaw</ref>" heading into town, a fellow named Tornado Johnson; besides he knows a fix-up when he sees one, and as he puts it, "I can mend my own shirts." Jim and Noah depart, but H.C. stays behind to tell File he knows the lie File's been living: that File's not a widower, as he claims to be—that his wife ran out on him. H.C. sees a man who's lonely and shut off, one who needs "a lot more mendin' than shirts," but File grows angry and defensive, and H.C. leaves him be.</p>
<p>As the ladies at the picnic grounds await the arrival of "The Hungry Men", File is noticeably not among them, and although her father and brothers do their best to console her, Lizzie feels the sting of File's rejection. Jim suggests she'd have more luck if she flirted more—played down her intelligence and told men what they wanted to hear: like Lily Ann Beasley, who has all the men in town weak in the knees. But Lizzie is resolute in her vision of a husband: "I want him to stand up straight—and I want to be able to stand up straight to him!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, something sounds like a dry, rattling crack of summer <ref target="/wiki/Thunder" title="Thunder">thunder</ref>, and with it appears a handsome stranger who introduces himself as "Starbuck—Rainmaker." His bold promises include the town into a revivalist frenzy ("The Rain Song"), and H.C. plunks down a hundred dollars for the promise of rain within twenty-four hours. But Lizzie sees through Starbuck's pretenses, and he instantly sees through hers ("You're Not Foolin' Me"). His accusations touch a nerve, and as he exits, a childhood song runs through her head ("Cinderella") that darkens her mood further. Feeling a need to "get out of me for a while," she imagines a different sort of Lizzie Curry ("Raunchy").</p>
<p>File appears unexpectedly at the picnic grounds and, still insistent that he has a right to be alone, nonetheless reaches out to Lizzie, coming clean about his past and, almost despite himself, revealing old wounds ("A Man and a Woman"). But as they start to open up to each other, Lizzie's candid comments—and her feeble attempts to retract them—drive File away in a fury. Her family appears instantly to grill her, and Noah lashes out at her father's efforts to console her, insisting she accept the reality that she's going to end up alone. Lizzie, with terror in her heart, faces her future ("Old Maid").</p>

<h3>Act II[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=110_in_the_Shade&action=edit&section=10" title="Edit section: Act II">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>As twilight approaches, lovers still haunt the picnic grounds. Starbuck is there as well, alone and quiet, doing a bit of soul-searching ("Evenin' Star", added for the 2007 revival). The others merely admire the majesty of the <ref target="/wiki/Night" title="Night">night</ref> sky ("Everything Beautiful Happens At Night"). For Lizzie, though, <ref target="/wiki/Twilight" title="Twilight">twilight</ref> means putting an end to her daydreams. And yet, still in search of something she can't quite define, she finds herself drawn to Starbuck's camp. Sensing her discontent, he encourages her to dream again—this time far beyond her small-town horizons ("Melisande"). Instinctively defensive, as before, Lizzie counters that her dreams are just a different kind ("Simple Little Things"), but feeling that she'll never get what she wants, she breaks down. Starbuck grabs her, encouraging her to see herself through her own eyes, and not as she fears others view her; he takes the pins out of her hair and insists she recognize her own beauty. The lights fade as they begin to make love.</p>
<p>Back at the picnic area, Jim is boasting of his own Fourth of July adventures ("Little Red Hat") when File arrives to tell the Curry clan that he's on the lookout for Tornado Johnson—aka rainmaker Starbuck. He understands that H.C. gave him a hundred dollars for the promise of rain, but H.C., well aware that Lizzie is with Starbuck, refuses to reveal his whereabouts. Noah is shocked that his father is willing to leave Lizzie alone with a <ref target="/wiki/Confidence_trick" title="Confidence trick">conman</ref>, but H.C. understands his daughter's needs, "even if it's only one minute—with a man talkin' quiet and his hand touchin' her face." And back at Starbuck's tent, that's precisely what's happening, as Starbuck shares a difficult <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Secret" title="Secret">secret</ref>: "I never made rain in my life! Not a single raindrop!" Lizzie counsels him that "it's not good to live in your dreams," but he notes that it's not good to live outside of them, either. She concluded that best way to live is "somewhere between the two" ("Is It Really Me?").</p>
<p>As the Curry family awaits Lizzie's arrival, the mood is silent and tense. But she appears joyous and transformed ("I've got a new beau!"), and when File arrives to <ref target="/wiki/Arrest" title="Arrest">arrest</ref> Starbuck, the entire Curry clan defends him. Starbuck implores Lizzie to join him in his travels, and File—suddenly aware of what he needs and what he might lose—steps forward to plead his own case ("Wonderful Music"). Lizzie, with a new sense of her own worth, makes her decision. As Starbuck exits for parts unknown, a low rumble of thunder ushers in a sudden <ref target="/wiki/Cloudburst" title="Cloudburst">cloudburst</ref>, less than twenty-four hours of his arrival. And as the townspeople revel at the heavy downpour ("The Rain Song" reprise), Lizzie and File rejoice in the promise of hope and renewal that <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rainfall" title="Rainfall">rainfall</ref> brings.</p>
