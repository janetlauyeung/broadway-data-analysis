<p>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum is a <ref target="/wiki/Musical_theatre" title="Musical theatre">musical</ref> with music and lyrics by <ref target="/wiki/Stephen_Sondheim" title="Stephen Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim</ref> and book by <ref target="/wiki/Burt_Shevelove" title="Burt Shevelove">Burt Shevelove</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Larry_Gelbart" title="Larry Gelbart">Larry Gelbart</ref>.</p>
<p>Inspired by the <ref target="/wiki/Farce" title="Farce">farces</ref> of the <ref target="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">ancient Roman</ref> playwright <ref target="/wiki/Plautus" title="Plautus">Plautus</ref> (251–183 BC), specifically <ref target="/wiki/Pseudolus" title="Pseudolus">Pseudolus</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Miles_Gloriosus_(play)" title="Miles Gloriosus (play)">Miles Gloriosus</ref>, and <ref target="/wiki/Mostellaria" title="Mostellaria">Mostellaria</ref>, the musical tells the bawdy story of a <ref target="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slave</ref> named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door. The plot displays many classic elements of <ref target="/wiki/Farce" title="Farce">farce</ref>, including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of <ref target="/wiki/Mistaken_identity" title="Mistaken identity">mistaken identity</ref> (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by <ref target="/wiki/Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</ref> comedians to begin a story: "A funny thing happened on the way to the theater".</p>
<p>The musical's original 1962 <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref> run won several <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Award" title="Tony Award">Tony Awards</ref>, including Best Musical and Best Author (Musical). A Funny Thing has enjoyed several Broadway and <ref target="/wiki/West_End_theatre" title="West End theatre">West End</ref> revivals and was made into a successful <ref target="/wiki/A_Funny_Thing_Happened_on_the_Way_to_the_Forum_(film)" title="A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)">film</ref> starring the original lead of the stage musical, <ref target="/wiki/Zero_Mostel" title="Zero Mostel">Zero Mostel</ref>.</p>

<h3>Original Broadway[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=A_Funny_Thing_Happened_on_the_Way_to_the_Forum&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Original Broadway">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum opened on <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref> on May 8, 1962, at the <ref target="/wiki/Neil_Simon_Theatre" title="Neil Simon Theatre">Alvin Theatre</ref>, and then transferred to the <ref target="/wiki/Mark_Hellinger_Theatre" title="Mark Hellinger Theatre">Mark Hellinger Theatre</ref> and the <ref target="/wiki/Majestic_Theatre_(Broadway)" title="Majestic Theatre (Broadway)">Majestic Theatre</ref>, where the show closed on August 29, 1964, after 964 performances and 8 previews.</p>
<p>The show's creators originally wanted <ref target="/wiki/Phil_Silvers" title="Phil Silvers">Phil Silvers</ref> in the lead role of <ref target="/wiki/Pseudolus" title="Pseudolus">Pseudolus</ref>, but he turned them down, allegedly because he would have to perform onstage without his glasses, and his vision was so poor that he feared tripping into the orchestra pit. He is also quoted as turning down the role for being "<ref target="/wiki/The_Phil_Silvers_Show" title="The Phil Silvers Show">Sgt. Bilko</ref> in a toga". (Silvers eventually played the role — wearing his glasses — in a 1972 revival. In the film, he played Marcus Lycus.) <ref target="/wiki/Milton_Berle" title="Milton Berle">Milton Berle</ref> also passed on the role. Eventually, Zero Mostel was cast.<ref target="#cite_note-green-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>During the out of town pre-Broadway tryouts the show was attracting little business and not playing well. <ref target="/wiki/Jerome_Robbins" title="Jerome Robbins">Jerome Robbins</ref> was called in to give advice and make changes. The biggest change Robbins made was a new opening number to replace "Love Is in the Air" and introduce the show as a bawdy, wild comedy. Stephen Sondheim wrote the song "Comedy Tonight" for this new opening.<ref target="#cite_note-green-1">[1]</ref> From that point on, the show was a success.</p>
<p>It was directed by <ref target="/wiki/George_Abbott" title="George Abbott">George Abbott</ref> and produced by <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hal_Prince" title="Hal Prince">Hal Prince</ref>, with choreography by <ref target="/wiki/Jack_Cole_(choreographer)" title="Jack Cole (choreographer)">Jack Cole</ref> and uncredited staging and choreography by Robbins. The scenic and costume design was by <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Walton" title="Tony Walton">Tony Walton</ref>. This wardrobe is on display at the Costume World Broadway Collection in Pompano Beach, Florida. The lighting design was by <ref target="/wiki/Jean_Rosenthal" title="Jean Rosenthal">Jean Rosenthal</ref>. Along with Mostel, the musical featured a cast of seasoned performers, including <ref target="/wiki/Jack_Gilford" title="Jack Gilford">Jack Gilford</ref> (Mostel's friend and fellow blacklist member), <ref target="/wiki/David_Burns_(actor)" title="David Burns (actor)">David Burns</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/John_Carradine" title="John Carradine">John Carradine</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Ruth_Kobart" title="Ruth Kobart">Ruth Kobart</ref>, and <ref target="/wiki/Raymond_Walburn" title="Raymond Walburn">Raymond Walburn</ref>. The young lovers were played by Brian Davies and Preshy Marker. <ref target="/wiki/Karen_Black" title="Karen Black">Karen Black</ref>, originally cast as the ingenue, was replaced out of town.</p>
<p>The show won several <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Award" title="Tony Award">Tony Awards</ref>: Best Musical, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor (Burns), Best Book, and Best Director. The score, however, was coolly received; it was Sondheim's first musical on Broadway in which he wrote both the music and lyrics, and did not earn a nomination for Best Original Score.</p>

<p>In ancient Rome, some neighbors live in three adjacent houses. In the center is the house of Senex, who lives there with wife Domina, son Hero, and several slaves, including head slave Hysterium and the musical's main character Pseudolus. A slave belonging to Hero, Pseudolus wishes to buy, win, or steal his freedom. One of the neighboring houses is owned by Marcus Lycus, who is a buyer and seller of beautiful women; the other belongs to the ancient Erronius, who is abroad searching for his long-lost children (stolen in infancy by pirates).</p>
<p>One day, Senex and Domina depart on a visit to Domina's mother and leave Pseudolus in charge of Hero. Hero confides in Pseudolus that he is in love with the lovely Philia, one of the courtesans in the House of Lycus (albeit still a virgin). Pseudolus promises to help him win Philia's love in exchange for his own freedom. Unfortunately (as the two find out when they pay a visit on Lycus), Philia has been sold to the renowned warrior <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miles_Gloriosus" title="Miles Gloriosus">Miles Gloriosus</ref>, who is expected to claim her very soon. Pseudolus, an excellent liar, uses Philia's cheery disposition to convince Lycus that she has picked up a <ref target="/wiki/Yersinia_pestis" title="Yersinia pestis">plague</ref> from <ref target="/wiki/Crete" title="Crete">Crete</ref>, which causes its victims to smile endlessly in its terminal stages. By offering to isolate her in Senex's house, he is able to give Philia and Hero some time alone together, and the two fall in love. But Philia insists that, even though she is in love with Hero, she must honor her contract with the Captain, for "that is the way of a courtesan." To appease her, he tells her to wait ("that's what virgins do best, isn't it?") inside, and that he will have the captain knock three times when he arrives. Pseudolus comes up with a plan to slip Philia a sleeping potion that will render her unconscious. He will then tell Lycus that she has died of the Cretan plague, and will offer to remove the body. Hero will come along, and they will stow away on a ship headed for Greece. Satisfied with his plan, Pseudolus steals Hysterium's book of potions and has Hero read him the recipe for the sleeping potion; the only ingredient he lacks is "mare's sweat", and Pseudolus goes off in search of some.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Senex returns home early from his trip, and knocks three times on his own door. Philia comes out of the house, and, thinking that Senex is the Captain, offers herself up to him. Surprised but game, Senex instructs Philia to wait in the house for him, and she does. Hysterium arrives to this confusion, and tells Senex that Philia is the new maid that he has hired. Pseudolus returns, having procured the necessary mare's sweat; seeing that Senex has returned unexpectedly and grasping the need to keep him out of the way, Pseudolus discreetly sprinkles some of the horse-sweat onto him, then suggests that the road trip has left Senex in dire need of a bath. Taking the bait, Senex instructs Hysterium to draw him a bath in the long-abandoned house of Erronius. But while this is happening, Erronius returns home, finally having given up the search for his long-lost children. Hysterium, desperate to keep him out of the house where his master is bathing, tells the old man that his house has become haunted – a story seemingly confirmed by the sound of Senex singing in his bath. Erronius immediately determines to have a soothsayer come and banish the spirit from his house, and Pseudolus obligingly poses as one, telling Erronius that, in order to banish the spirit, he must travel seven times around the seven hills of Rome (thus keeping the old man occupied and out of the way for quite a while).</p>
<p>When Miles Gloriosus arrives to claim his courtesan-bride, Pseudolus hides Philia on the roof of Senex's house; told that she has "escaped," Lycus is terrified to face the Captain's wrath. Pseudolus offers to impersonate Lycus and talk his way out of the mess but, his ingenuity flagging, he ends up merely telling the Captain that Philia has disappeared, and that he, "Lycus", will search for her. Displeased and suspicious, Miles insists that his soldiers accompany Pseudolus, but the wily slave loses them in Rome's winding streets.</p>
<p>Complicating matters further, Domina returns from her trip early, suspicious that her husband Senex is "up to something low." She disguises herself in virginal white robes and a veil (much like Philia's) to try to catch Senex being unfaithful. Pseudolus convinces Hysterium to help him by dressing in <ref target="/wiki/Drag_(clothing)" title="Drag (clothing)">drag</ref> and pretending to be Philia, "dead" from the plague. Unfortunately, it turns out that Miles Gloriosus has just returned from Crete, where there is of course no actual plague. With the ruse thus revealed, the main characters run for their lives, resulting in a madcap chase across the stage with both Miles and Senex pursuing all three "Philia"s (Domina, Hysterium, and the actual Philia – all wearing identical white robes and veils). Meanwhile, the courtesans from the house of Marcus Lycus – who had been recruited as mourners at "Philia"'s ersatz funeral – have escaped, and Lycus sends his <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eunuch_(court_official)" title="Eunuch (court official)">eunuchs</ref> out to bring them all back, adding to the general pandemonium.</p>
<p>Finally, the Captain's troops are able to round everyone up. His plot thoroughly unraveled, Pseudolus appears to be in deep trouble – but Erronius, completing his third circuit of the Roman hills, shows up fortuitously to discover that Miles Gloriosus and Philia are wearing matching rings which mark them as his long-lost children. Philia's betrothal to the Captain is nullified by the unexpected revelation that he's her brother, and, as the daughter of a free-born citizen, she's freed from Marcus Lycus. Philia weds Hero; Pseudolus gets his freedom and the lovely courtesan Gymnasia; Gloriosus receives twin courtesans to replace Philia; and Erronius is reunited with his children. A happy ending prevails for all – except for poor Senex, stuck with his shrewish wife Domina.</p>

<p>The song "Love Is in the Air" was originally intended as the opening number. The song was cut from the show and replaced with "Comedy Tonight".<ref target="#cite_note-20">[20]</ref> The song was later featured in the film <ref target="/wiki/The_Birdcage" title="The Birdcage">The Birdcage</ref> (1996) and performed by <ref target="/wiki/Robin_Williams" title="Robin Williams">Robin Williams</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Christine_Baranski" title="Christine Baranski">Christine Baranski</ref>. Another draft of the opening number, "Invocation and Instructions to the Audience," has been used in subsequent revues of Sondheim songs and was sung by Nathan Lane in the musical <ref target="/wiki/The_Frogs_(musical)" title="The Frogs (musical)">The Frogs</ref>. "Pretty Little Picture" is frequently dropped from productions of the show, and one verse of "I'm Calm" is also frequently trimmed. Other cut songs include "Love Story (Your Eyes Are Blue)" and "The Echo Song".<ref target="#cite_note-21">[21]</ref> The song "Farewell" was added to the 1972 Broadway revival.</p>
