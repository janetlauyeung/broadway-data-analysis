<h2>Plot[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Angels_in_America&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Plot">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Part One: Millennium Approaches[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Angels_in_America&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Part One: Millennium Approaches">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Set in New York City, the play takes place between October 1985 and February 1986.<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> The play begins with the funeral of Sarah Ironson, an elderly <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jewish" title="Jewish">Jewish</ref> woman, whose rabbi eulogizes not only her, but her entire generation of immigrants who risked their lives to build a community for their children in a strange land. After the funeral, Sarah's grandson, Louis Ironson, learns that his lover Prior Walter, the last member of a long-lived <ref target="/wiki/White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestant" title="White Anglo-Saxon Protestant">WASP</ref> (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) family, has <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/AIDS" title="AIDS">AIDS</ref>. As Prior's illness progresses, Louis becomes unable to cope and moves out, leaving Prior to deal with his abandonment. He is given emotional support by his friend Belize, an ex-drag queen and a hospital nurse, who also must deal with Louis' self-castigating guilt and myriad excuses for his behavior.</p>
<p>Joe Pitt, a Mormon, <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_Republican_Party" title="United States Republican Party">Republican</ref> clerk in the same judge's office where Louis holds a clerical job, is offered a position in Washington, D.C., by his mentor, the <ref target="/wiki/McCarthyism" title="McCarthyism">McCarthyist</ref> lawyer and power broker <ref target="/wiki/Roy_Cohn" title="Roy Cohn">Roy Cohn</ref>. Joe hesitates to accept out of concern for his <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Agoraphobic" title="Agoraphobic">agoraphobic</ref>, <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Valium" title="Valium">valium</ref>-addicted wife Harper, who refuses to move. Harper suspects that Joe does not love her in the same way she loves him, which is confirmed when Joe confesses his homosexuality. Harper retreats into drug-fueled escapist fantasies, including a dream where she crosses paths with Prior even though the two of them have never met in the real world. Torn by pressure from Roy and a burgeoning infatuation with Louis, Joe drunkenly comes out to his conservative mother Hannah, who reacts badly. Concerned for her son, she sells her house in Salt Lake City and travels to New York to help repair his marriage. Meanwhile, a drug-addled Harper has fled their apartment after a confrontation with Joe, wandering the streets of Brooklyn believing she is in Antarctica as Joe and Louis tentatively begin an affair.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Roy Cohn discovers that he has advanced AIDS and is dying. Defiantly refusing to publicly admit he is gay or has AIDS, Roy instead declares he has liver cancer. Facing disbarment for borrowing money from a client, Roy is determined to beat the case so he can die a lawyer and he attempts to position Joe in the Justice Department with the aim of having a friend in a useful place. When Joe at last refuses his offer, he flies into a rage and collapses in pain. As he awaits transport to the hospital, he is visited by the ghost of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ethel_Rosenberg" title="Ethel Rosenberg">Ethel Rosenberg</ref>, whom he prosecuted in her trial for espionage, and who was executed after Roy illegally lobbied the judge for the death penalty.</p>
<p>Prior begins to hear an angelic voice telling him to prepare for her arrival, and receives visits from a pair of ghosts who claim to be his own ancestors, who inform him he is a prophet. Prior does not know if these visitations are caused by an emotional breakdown or if they are real. At the end of Part One, Prior is visited by an <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Angels" title="Angels">angel</ref>, who crashes through his bedroom ceiling and proclaims that "the Great Work" has begun.</p>

<h3>Part Two: Perestroika[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Angels_in_America&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Part Two: Perestroika">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>At the funeral of a friend, a shaken Prior relates his encounter with the Angel to Belize. After revealing the presence of a mystical book underneath the tile in Prior's kitchen, the Angel reveals to him that Heaven is a beautiful city that resembles <ref target="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</ref>, and God, described as a great flaming <ref target="/wiki/Aleph" title="Aleph">Aleph</ref>, created the universe through copulation with His angels, who are all-knowing but unable to create or change on their own. God, bored with the angels, made mankind with the power to change and create. The progress of mankind on Earth caused Heaven to suffer earthquake-like tremors and physically deteriorate. Finally, on the day of the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/San_Francisco_earthquake" title="San Francisco earthquake">San Francisco earthquake</ref> in 1906, God abandoned Heaven. The Angel brings Prior a message for mankind—"stop moving!"—in the belief that if man ceases to progress, Heaven will be restored. Belize believes that Prior is <ref target="/wiki/Psychological_projection" title="Psychological projection">projecting</ref> his own fears of abandonment into an elaborate hallucination, but Prior suspects that his illness is the prophecy taking physical form, and that the only way the Angel can force him to deliver her message is to die.</p>
<p>Roy lands at the hospital in the care of Belize, where his condition rapidly declines. He manages to use his political clout to acquire a private stash of the experimental drug <ref target="/wiki/Zidovudine" title="Zidovudine">AZT</ref>, at the expense of withholding the drug from participants in a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Drug_trial" title="Drug trial">drug trial</ref>. Alone in a hospital, Cohn finds himself increasingly isolated, with only Belize, who despises him, and the ghost of Ethel for company. Joe visits Roy, who is near death, and receives a final, paternal blessing from his mentor. However, when Joe confesses he has left Harper for a man, Roy rejects him in a violent reaction of fear and rage, ordering him to return to his wife and cover up his indiscretion.</p>
<p>Prior goes to a Mormon visitor's center to research angels, where he meets Hannah, who is volunteering there and taking care of Harper, who has slowly returned to reality but is now deeply depressed. Harper and Prior share a spark of recognition from their shared dream, and witness a vision of Joe and Louis together. Prior, with Belize in tow, attempts to confront Joe about Louis, and Joe recognizes Belize as Roy's nurse. Louis, regretting his actions, begins to withdraw from Joe and begs Prior's forgiveness, which Prior angrily refuses. Belize informs Louis about Joe's connection with Roy, whom Louis despises for his conservative politics and underhanded dealings. Louis, as a result, researches Joe's legal history and confronts him over a series of hypocritical and homophobic decisions Joe recommended to the courts. The confrontation turns violent, and Joe punches Louis in the face, ending their affair.</p>
<p>Ethel Rosenberg watches Roy suffer and decline before delivering the final blow as he lies dying: He has been disbarred after all. Delirious, Roy seems to mistake Ethel for his mother, begging her to comfort him, and Ethel sings a Yiddish Lullaby as Roy appears to pass away. However, with a sudden burst of energy he reveals that he has tricked her, viciously declaring that he has finally beaten her by making her sing. He then collapses and dies. After Roy's death, Belize forces Louis to visit Roy's hospital room, where they steal his stash of AZT for Prior. He asks Louis to recite the <ref target="/wiki/Kaddish" title="Kaddish">Kaddish</ref> for Roy. Unseen by the living, Ethel guides Louis through the prayer, symbolically forgiving Roy before she departs for the hereafter.</p>
<p>After his confrontation with Joe, Prior collapses from pneumonia while visiting the Mormon center and Hannah rushes him back to the hospital. Prior tells her about his vision and is surprised when Hannah accepts this, based on her belief in <ref target="/wiki/Angel_Moroni" title="Angel Moroni">angelic revelations within the Mormon church</ref>. At the hospital, the Angel reappears enraged that Prior rejected her message. Prior, on Hannah's advice, <ref target="/wiki/Jacob_wrestling_with_the_angel" title="Jacob wrestling with the angel">wrestles the Angel</ref>, who relents and opens <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_ladder" title="Jacob's ladder">a ladder</ref> into Heaven. Prior climbs into Heaven and tells the other angels that he refuses to deliver their message, as without progress, humanity will perish, and begs them for more Life, no matter how horrible the prospect might be. He returns to his hospital bed, where he awakens from his vision with his fever broken and his health beginning to recover. He makes amends with Louis, but refuses to take him back. Meanwhile, Harper leaves Joe and departs New York for San Francisco.</p>
<p>The play concludes in 1990. Prior and Louis are still separated, but Louis, along with Belize, remain close in order to support and care for Prior, and Hannah has found new perspective on her rigid beliefs, allowing her to accept her son as he is and forge a friendship with Prior. Prior, Louis, Belize, and Hannah gather before the angel statue in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bethesda_Fountain" title="Bethesda Fountain">Bethesda Fountain</ref>, discussing <ref target="/wiki/Perestroika" title="Perestroika">the fall of the Soviet Union</ref> and what the future holds. Prior talks of <ref target="/wiki/Pool_of_Bethesda#Gospel_of_John" title="Pool of Bethesda">the legend of the Pool of Bethesda</ref>, where the sick were healed. Prior delivers the play's final lines directly to the audience, affirming his intentions to live on and telling them that "the Great Work" shall continue.</p>

<h2>Staging[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Angels_in_America&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: Staging">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Kushner prefers that the theatricality be transparent. In his notes about staging, he writes: "The plays benefit from a pared-down style of presentation, with scenery kept to an evocative and informative minimum. [...] I recommend rapid scene shifts (no blackouts!), employing the cast as well as stagehands in shifting the scene. This must be an actor-driven event. [...] The moments of magic [...] are to be fully imagined and realized, as wonderful theatrical illusions—which means it's OK if the wires show, and maybe it's good that they do..." Kushner is an admirer of Brecht, who practiced a style of theatrical production whereby audiences were often reminded that they were in a theatre. The choice to have "no blackouts" allows audiences to participate in the construction of a malleable theatrical world.</p>
<p>One of the many theatrical devices in Angels is that each of the eight main actors has one or several other minor roles in the play. For example, the actor playing the nurse, Emily, also plays the Angel, Sister Ella Chapter (a real estate agent), and a homeless woman. This <ref target="/wiki/Dual_role" title="Dual role">doubling and tripling of roles</ref> encourages the audience to consider the elasticity of, for example, gender and sexual identities.</p>

<p>Main article: <ref target="/wiki/Angels_in_America_(miniseries)" title="Angels in America (miniseries)">Angels in America (miniseries)</ref></p>
<p>In 2003, <ref target="/wiki/HBO" title="HBO">HBO</ref> Films created a miniseries version of the play. Kushner adapted his original text for the screen, and <ref target="/wiki/Mike_Nichols" title="Mike Nichols">Mike Nichols</ref> directed. HBO broadcast the film in various formats: three-hour segments that correspond to Millennium Approaches and Perestroika, as well as one-hour "chapters" that roughly correspond to an act or two of each of these plays. The first three chapters were initially broadcast on December 7, to international acclaim, with the final three chapters following. <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Angels_in_America_(TV_miniseries)" title="Angels in America (TV miniseries)">Angels in America</ref> was the most watched made-for-cable movie in 2003 and won both the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Golden_Globe" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe</ref> and <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emmy" title="Emmy">Emmy</ref> for Best Miniseries.</p>
<p>Kushner made certain changes to his play (especially Part Two, Perestroika) for it to work on screen, but the HBO version is generally a faithful representation of Kushner's original work. Kushner has been quoted as saying that he knew Nichols was the right person to direct the movie when, at their first meeting, Nichols immediately said that he wanted actors to play <ref target="/wiki/Dual_role" title="Dual role">multiple roles</ref>, as had been done in onstage productions.</p>

<p>Angels in America – The Opera made its world premiere at the <ref target="/wiki/Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre_du_Ch%C3%A2telet" title="Théâtre du Châtelet">Théâtre du Châtelet</ref> in Paris, France, on November 23, 2004. The opera was based on both parts of the Angels in America fantasia, however the script was re-worked and condensed to fit both parts into a two and half hour show. <ref target="/wiki/Composer" title="Composer">Composer</ref> <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Peter_E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s" title="Peter Eötvös">Peter Eötvös</ref> explains: "In the opera version, I put less emphasis on the political line than Kushner...I rather focus on the passionate relationships, on the highly dramatic suspense of the wonderful text, on the permanently uncertain state of the visions." A German version of the opera followed suit in mid-2005. The opera made its US debut in June 2006 at the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stanford_Calderwood_Pavilion" title="Stanford Calderwood Pavilion">Stanford Calderwood Pavilion</ref> in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>

<h3>Music[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Angels_in_America&action=edit&section=12" title="Edit section: Music">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The text of Prior Walter's soliloquy from Scene 5 of Perestroika was set to music by <ref class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Michael_Shaieb&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Michael Shaieb (page does not exist)">Michael Shaieb</ref> for a 2009 festival celebrating Kushner's work at the <ref target="/wiki/Guthrie_Theater" title="Guthrie Theater">Guthrie Theater</ref>.

<h2>Critical reception[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Angels_in_America&action=edit&section=13" title="Edit section: Critical reception">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Angels in America received numerous awards, including the 1993 and 1994 Tony Awards for Best Play. The play's first part, Millennium Approaches, received the 1993 <ref target="/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Drama" title="Pulitzer Prize for Drama">Pulitzer Prize for Drama</ref>.</p>
<p>The play garnered much praise upon its release for its dialogue and exploration of social issues.

<p>By contrast, in an essay titled "Angles in America", the cultural critic <ref target="/wiki/Lee_Siegel_(cultural_critic)" title="Lee Siegel (cultural critic)">Lee Siegel</ref> wrote in <ref target="/wiki/The_New_Republic" title="The New Republic">The New Republic</ref>, "Angels in America is a second-rate play written by a second-rate playwright who happens to be gay, and because he has written a play about being gay, and about AIDS, no one—and I mean no one—is going to call Angels in America the overwrought, coarse, posturing, formulaic mess that it is."<ref target="#cite_note-31">[31]</ref></p>

<h3>Controversy[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Angels_in_America&action=edit&section=14" title="Edit section: Controversy">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>In response to the frank treatment of homosexuality and AIDS, and brief male nudity, the play quickly became subject to controversial reaction from conservative and religious groups, sometimes labelled as being part of the "<ref target="/wiki/Culture_war" title="Culture war">culture war</ref>".<ref target="#cite_note-32">[32]</ref> In Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1996, there were protests held outside a production of the play by the Charlotte Repertory Theatre at the <ref target="/wiki/North_Carolina_Blumenthal_Performing_Arts_Center" title="North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center">North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-33">[33]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-34">[34]</ref> This led to funding cuts for the Arts & Science Council of Charlotte, the city's arts funding agency, in the following year.<ref target="#cite_note-35">[35]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-36">[36]</ref></p>
