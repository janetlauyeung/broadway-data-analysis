<h2>Synopsis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=On_a_Clear_Day_You_Can_See_Forever&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Synopsis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Act I</p>
<p>Quirky Daisy Gamble sees herself as an unremarkable person and has low self-esteem, even though she can (1) make plants grow remarkably, (2) predict when a telephone will ring or someone will drop in, and (3) tell where to find an object that someone else is looking for. Her current problem, though, is her nasty smoking habit, which will interfere with the chances of her fiancé, Warren, for a job with great benefits. She seeks help from a psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Bruckner, to stop smoking. When he hypnotizes her, she describes living a previous life in late 18th century England as "Melinda Wells", who died in her late twenties from circumstances beyond her control. Free spirited Melinda was in love with portrait painter Edward Moncrief. Dr. Mark keeps to himself what Daisy has revealed to him, and he tells her that she should not be ashamed of her ESP.</p>
<p>At their next session, Daisy, under hypnosis, relates scenes from the salacious London Hellrakers' Club where Melinda met Edward. Melinda and Edward eventually marry, but the painter is unfaithful to her, making love to his subjects. Mark, the psychiatrist, finds himself falling for "Melinda" and becomes convinced that Daisy is really the reincarnation of Melinda. Melinda finally left Edward and set sail for America, but the ship never reached Boston. Before Mark can save Melinda from shipwreck, Daisy wakes up.</p>

<p>Act II</p>
<p>Mark reports on the case to his fellow psychiatrists, who ridicule his findings. Greek shipping magnate Themistocles Kriakos learns of Mark's belief in reincarnation and offers to finance a study of the events of Melinda's life in exchange for Mark's help in discovering who he will be in his next life, which will allow him to leave his fortune to his future self. Daisy accidentally discovers that she is the "Melinda" at the center of the growing controversy and that Mark prefers Melinda to herself. In her angry confrontation with the psychiatrist about the matter, she tells him that she is "through being a go-between for you and your dream girl. You're not going to go on using my head for a motel." </p>
<p>Daisy goes to the airport, ready to return home. Her ESP powers warn her that the plane on which she plans to travel will crash. She realizes at last how special she really is. She leaves her starchy fiancé (Come Back To Me) and she and Mark unite to explore their extraordinary future.</p>

<h2>Versions[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=On_a_Clear_Day_You_Can_See_Forever&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Versions">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The musical is available in at least two noticeably different published versions (aside from the film version), although the basic plot-line remains the same. The first version was published in 1966.<ref target="#cite_note-12">[12]</ref> The musical numbers recorded in the original <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref> cast album<ref target="#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> of 1965 correspond to this version. </p>
<p>A second version is evident in the piano-vocal score published in 1967.<ref target="#cite_note-14">[14]</ref> Here several vocal <ref target="/wiki/Number_(music)" title="Number (music)">numbers</ref> from the above version are missing ("Ring Out the Bells," "Tosy and Cosh", "Don't Tamper with my Sister"), as is the introduction to the song "Hurry, It's Lovely Up Here," which is recorded on the cast album. Also, the Greek millionaire's solo, "When I'm Being Born Again" is given completely different lyrics ("When I Come Around Again") and sung instead by Daisy's friends. The <ref target="/wiki/Overture" title="Overture">overture</ref> recorded on the cast album combines the "overture" and "<ref target="/wiki/Entr%27acte" title="Entr'acte">entr'acte</ref>" printed in the vocal score.</p>
<p>The <ref target="/wiki/On_a_Clear_Day_You_Can_See_Forever_(film)" title="On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (film)">1970 film version</ref> departed from the musical significantly, adding a character for <ref target="/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</ref> (an ex-stepbrother named "Tad"), and changing details of other characters, moving the period of Melinda's life ahead by a decade or two (into the early 19th century), removing several songs, changing lyrics and adding two new songs.</p>
