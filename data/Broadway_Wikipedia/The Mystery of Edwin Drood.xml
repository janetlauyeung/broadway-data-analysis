<h2>Summary[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mystery_of_Edwin_Drood&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Summary">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The novel begins as John Jasper leaves a London <ref target="/wiki/Opium_den" title="Opium den">opium den</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> The next evening, Edwin Drood visits Jasper, who is the choirmaster at Cloisterham Cathedral. Edwin confides that he has misgivings about his betrothal to Rosa Bud. The next day, Edwin visits Rosa at the Nuns' House, the boarding school where she lives. They quarrel good-naturedly, which they apparently do frequently during his visits. Meanwhile, Jasper, having an interest in the cathedral crypt, seeks the company of Durdles, a man who knows more about the crypt than anyone else.</p>
<p>Neville Landless and his twin sister Helena are sent to Cloisterham for their education. Neville will study with the <ref target="/wiki/Minor_canon" title="Minor canon">minor canon</ref>, Rev. Mr. Crisparkle; Helena will live at the Nuns' House with Rosa. Neville confides to Rev. Mr Crisparkle that he had hated his cruel stepfather, while Rosa confides to Helena that she loathes and fears her music-master, Jasper. Neville is immediately smitten with Rosa and is indignant that Edwin prizes his betrothal lightly. Edwin provokes him and he reacts violently, giving Jasper the opportunity to spread rumours about Neville's reputation of having a violent temper. Rev. Mr Crisparkle tries to reconcile Edwin and Neville, who agrees to apologise to Edwin if the former will forgive him. It is arranged that they will dine together for this purpose on Christmas Eve at Jasper's home.</p>
<p>Rosa's guardian, Mr. Grewgious, tells her that she has a substantial inheritance from her father. When she asks whether there would be any forfeiture if she did not marry Edwin, he replies that there would be none on either side. Back at his office in London, Mr. Grewgious gives Edwin a ring which Rosa's father had given to her mother, with the proviso that Edwin must either give the ring to Rosa as a sign of his irrevocable commitment to her or return it to Mr. Grewgious. Mr. Bazzard, Mr. Grewgious's clerk, witnesses this transaction.</p>
<p>Next day, Rosa and Edwin amicably agree to end their betrothal.</p>
<p>They decide to ask Mr. Grewgious to break the news to Jasper, and Edwin intends to return the ring to Mr. Grewgious. Meanwhile, Durdles takes Jasper into the cathedral <ref target="/wiki/Crypt" title="Crypt">crypt</ref>. On the way there Durdles points out a mound of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quicklime" title="Quicklime">quicklime</ref>. Jasper provides a bottle of wine to Durdles. The wine is mysteriously potent and Durdles soon loses consciousness; while unconscious he dreams that Jasper goes off by himself in the crypt. As they return from the crypt, they encounter a boy called Deputy, and Jasper, thinking he was spying on them, takes him by the throat – but, seeing that this will strangle him, lets him go.</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, Neville buys himself a heavy walking stick; he plans to spend his Christmas break hiking around the countryside. Meanwhile, Edwin visits a jeweller to repair his pocket watch; it is mentioned that the only pieces of jewellery that he wears are the watch and chain and a shirt pin. By chance he meets a woman who is an opium user from London. She asks Drood's Christian name and he replies that it is 'Edwin'; she says he is fortunate it is not 'Ned,' for 'Ned' is in great danger. He thinks nothing of this, for the only person who calls him 'Ned' is Jasper. Meanwhile, Jasper buys himself a black scarf of strong silk, which is not seen again during the course of the novel. The reconciliation dinner is successful and at midnight, Drood and Neville Landless leave together to go down to the river and look at a wind storm that rages that night.</p>
<p>The next morning Edwin is missing and Jasper spreads suspicion that Neville has killed him. Neville leaves early in the morning for his hike; the townspeople overtake him and bring him back to the city. Rev. Mr Crisparkle keeps Neville out of jail by taking responsibility for him: he will produce him anytime his presence is required. That night Jasper is grief-stricken when Mr. Grewgious informs him that Edwin and Rosa had ended their betrothal; he reacts more strongly to this news than to the prospect that Edwin may be dead. The next morning, Rev. Mr Crisparkle goes to the river <ref target="/wiki/Weir" title="Weir">weir</ref> and finds Edwin's watch and chain and his shirt pin.</p>
<p>A half-year later, Neville is living in London near Mr. Grewgious's office. Mr. Tartar introduces himself and offers to share his garden with Landless; Mr. Tartar's chambers are adjacent to Neville's above a common courtyard. A stranger who calls himself Dick Datchery arrives in Cloisterham. He rents a room below Jasper and observes the comings and goings in the area. On his way to the lodging the first time, Mr. Datchery asks directions from Deputy. Deputy will not go near there for fear that Jasper will choke him again.</p>
<p>Jasper visits Rosa at the Nuns' House and professes his love for her. She rejects him but he persists; he says that if she gives him no hope, he will destroy Neville, the brother of her dear friend Helena. In fear of Jasper, Rosa goes to Mr. Grewgious in London.</p>
<p>The next day Rev. Mr Crisparkle follows Rosa to London. When he is with Mr. Grewgious and Rosa, Mr. Tartar calls and asks if he remembers him. Rev. Crisparkle does remember him, as the one who years before saved him from drowning. They do not dare let Rosa contact Neville and Helena directly, for fear that Jasper may be watching Neville, but Mr. Tartar allows Rosa to visit his chambers to contact Helena above the courtyard. Mr. Grewgious arranges for Rosa to rent a place from Mrs. Billickin and for Miss Twinkleton to live with her there so that she can live there respectably.</p>
<p>Jasper visits the London opium den again for the first time since Edwin's disappearance. When he leaves at dawn, the woman who runs the opium den follows him. She vows to herself that she will not lose his trail again as she did after his last visit. This time she follows him all the way to his home in Cloisterham; outside she meets Mr. Datchery, who tells her Jasper's name and that he will sing the next morning in the cathedral service. On inquiry, Datchery learns she is called "Princess Puffer." The next morning she attends the service and shakes her fists at Jasper from behind a pillar.</p>
<p>Dickens's death leaves the rest of the story unknown. According to his friend and biographer <ref target="/wiki/John_Forster_(biographer)" title="John Forster (biographer)">John Forster</ref>, after Dickens had written him two brief letters which relate to the plot (but not the murder), he had supplied Forster with an outline of the full plot:</p>

<p>His first fancy for the tale was expressed in a letter in the middle of July. "What should you think of the idea of a story beginning in this way?—Two people, boy and girl, or very young, going apart from one another, pledged to be married after many years—at the end of the book. The interest to arise out of the tracing of their separate ways, and the impossibility of telling what will be done with that impending fate." This was laid aside; but it left a marked trace on the story as afterwards designed, in the position of Edwin Drood and his betrothed.</p>
<p>I first heard of the later design in a letter dated "Friday the 6th of August 1869", in which after speaking, with the usual unstinted praise he bestowed always on what moved him in others, of a little tale he had received for his journal, he spoke of the change that had occurred to him for the new tale by himself. "I laid aside the fancy I told you of, and have a very curious and new idea for my new story. Not a communicable idea (or the interest of the book would be gone), but a very strong one, though difficult to work." The story, I learnt immediately afterward, was to be that of the murder of a nephew by his uncle; the originality of which was to consist in the review of the murderer's career by himself at the close, when its temptations were to be dwelt upon as if, not he the culprit, but some other man, were the tempted. The last chapters were to be written in the condemned cell, to which his wickedness, all elaborately elicited from him as if told of another, had brought him. Discovery by the murderer of the utter needlessness of the murder for its object, was to follow hard upon commission of the deed; but all discovery of the murderer was to be baffled till towards the close, when, by means of a gold ring which had resisted the corrosive effects of the lime into which he had thrown the body, not only the person murdered was to be identified but the locality of the crime and the man who committed it. So much was told to me before any of the book was written; and it will be recollected that the ring, taken by Drood to be given to his betrothed only if their engagement went on, was brought away with him from their last interview. Rosa was to marry Tartar, and Crisparkle the sister of Landless, who was himself, I think, to have perished in assisting Tartar finally to unmask and seize the murderer.<ref target="#cite_note-5">[5]</ref></p>
<h2>Characters[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mystery_of_Edwin_Drood&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</ref>]</h2>

<p>Neville and Helena Landless: twin orphans. They are from <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ceylon" title="Ceylon">Ceylon</ref>, but it is not clear to what extent they are Ceylonese. In their childhood they were mistreated and deprived. Neville is immediately smitten by Rosa Bud. He is more proud than is good for him, and his integrity prevents him from making an insincere apology to Drood. Helena and Rosa become dear friends.</p>
<p>Rev. Septimus Crisparkle: <ref target="/wiki/Minor_canon" title="Minor canon">minor canon</ref> of Cloisterham Cathedral and Neville Landless's mentor.</p>

<h3>The murderer[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mystery_of_Edwin_Drood&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: The murderer">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Although the killer is not revealed, it is generally believed that John Jasper, Edwin's uncle, is the murderer. There are three reasons:</p>

<p>John Forster had the plot described to him by Dickens: "The story ... was to be that of the murder of a nephew by his uncle."<ref target="#cite_note-r1-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>Luke Fildes, who illustrated the story, said that Dickens had told him, when they were discussing an illustration, "I must have the double necktie! It is necessary, for Jasper strangles Edwin Drood with it."<ref target="#cite_note-r1-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>Dickens's son Charles stated that his father had told him unequivocally that Jasper was the murderer.<ref target="#cite_note-r1-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>The book gives other hints:</p>

<p>It describes a nightly scene in which Jasper goes secretly with Durdles to the graveyard. Jasper sees <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quicklime" title="Quicklime">quicklime</ref>, at that time believed to hasten the decomposition of bodies.</p>
<p>A day before he disappears, Edwin talks with Princess Puffer in the graveyard. She tells him "Ned" is in great danger. Later it turns out she has been following John Jasper from London, and he told her something in his state of intoxication. Furthermore, Jasper is the only one who refers to Edwin Drood as "Ned".</p>
<p>On the day Edwin is reported missing, Jasper is informed by Grewgious, Rosa's guardian, that she and Edwin had broken off their engagement. Jasper collapses in a state of shock: could it be because of a murder that was unnecessary?<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>Rosa Bud has always been afraid of John Jasper, and in the afternoon of a warm day, half a year after Edwin's disappearance, he tells her his love for her might be enough to get even his beloved nephew out of the way.</p>
<p>Princess Puffer tries to follow Jasper, she suspects him of something because of what he said during his opium intoxication. Jasper says to Puffer at the end of the book: "Suppose you had something in your mind; something you were going to do... Should you do it in your fancy, when you were lying here doing this?... I did it over and over again. I have done it hundreds of thousands of times in this room."</p>
<p>The very first hint (Mr. Jasper being concerned about what he may say while in an opium stupor) occurs in the first pages when Mr. Jasper listens to other opium users and says "unintelligible!". On his last opium trip, Puffer says to him, while he sleeps: "'Unintelligible' I heard you say, of two more than me. But don't ye be too sure always; don't ye be too sure, beauty!"</p>
<p>Lastly, on the day of Edwin's disappearance, Jasper was in an ebullient state of mind all day, performing in the choir with great self-command.</p>
<h3>Dick Datchery[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mystery_of_Edwin_Drood&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Dick Datchery">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Datchery appears some time after Edwin's disappearance and keeps a close eye on Jasper. There are hints that he is in disguise, and this theme has been taken up in adaptations of the story which try to solve the mystery: in the 1935 movie production of the story, starring <ref target="/wiki/Claude_Rains" title="Claude Rains">Claude Rains</ref> as Jasper, Datchery is Neville Landless in disguise. A <ref target="/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</ref> radio drama of 1990, starring <ref target="/wiki/Ian_Holm" title="Ian Holm">Ian Holm</ref> as Jasper, had Datchery as an actor who investigates mysteries between performances.<ref target="#cite_note-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>In <ref target="/wiki/Leon_Garfield" title="Leon Garfield">Leon Garfield</ref>'s continuation, Datchery is a former actor turned private detective hired by Mr. Grewgious. In the 2012 BBC television drama, written by Gwyneth Hughes, Datchery is Mr. Bazzard.</p>
<p>A strong argument can be made for Datchery being Tartar. Datchery is described at one point as walking with his hands clasped behind him – "as the wont of such buffers is", a walking stance frequently associated with naval officers pacing a quarter-deck. Frequently there are similar expressions used to describe both characters.</p>

<h2>Original publication[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mystery_of_Edwin_Drood&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Original publication">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The Mystery of Edwin Drood was scheduled to be published in twelve instalments (shorter than Dickens's usual twenty) from April 1870 to February 1871, each costing one <ref target="/wiki/Shilling" title="Shilling">shilling</ref> and illustrated by <ref target="/wiki/Luke_Fildes" title="Luke Fildes">Luke Fildes</ref>. Only six of the instalments were completed before Dickens's death in 1870. It was therefore approximately half finished.</p>

<p>I: April 1870 (chapters 1–5)</p>
<p>II: May 1870 (chapters 6–9)</p>
<p>III: June 1870 (chapters 10–12)</p>
<p>IV: July 1870 (chapters 13–16)</p>
<p>V: August 1870 (chapters 17–20)</p>
<p>VI: September 1870 (chapters 21–23)</p>
<p>Planned instalments never published:</p>

<p>VII: October 1870</p>
<p>VIII: November 1870</p>
<p>IX: December 1870</p>
<p>X: January 1871</p>

<h2>Continuations[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mystery_of_Edwin_Drood&action=edit&section=7" title="Edit section: Continuations">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Supplying a conclusion to The Mystery of Edwin Drood has occupied writers from the time of Dickens' death to the present day.</p>
<p>The first three attempts to complete the story were undertaken by Americans. The first, by <ref target="/wiki/Robert_Henry_Newell" title="Robert Henry Newell">Robert Henry Newell</ref>, published under the pen name Orpheus C. Kerr in 1870,<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> was as much a parody as a continuation, transplanting the story to the United States. It is a "burlesque" farce rather than a serious attempt to continue in the spirit of the original story.</p>
<p>The second ending was written by Henry Morford, a New York journalist. He travelled to Rochester with his wife and published the ending serially during his stay in England from 1871–1872. In this ending, Edwin Drood survives Jasper's murder attempt. Datchery is Bazzard in disguise, but Helena disguises herself as well to overhear Jasper's mumbling under the influence of opium. Entitled John Jasper's Secret: Sequel to Charles Dickens' Mystery of Edwin Drood, it was rumoured to have been authored by <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Charles_Dickens,_Jr." title="Charles Dickens, Jr.">Charles Dickens, Jr.</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Wilkie_Collins" title="Wilkie Collins">Wilkie Collins</ref>, despite Collins' disavowal.<ref target="#cite_note-10">[10]</ref></p>
<p>The third attempt was perhaps the most unusual. In 1873, a <ref target="/wiki/Brattleboro,_Vermont" title="Brattleboro, Vermont">Brattleboro, Vermont</ref> printer, <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thomas_Power_James" title="Thomas Power James">Thomas Power James</ref>, published a version which he claimed had been literally 'ghost-written' by him channeling Dickens' spirit.<ref target="#cite_note-:0-11">[11]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-:1-12">[12]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> A sensation was created, with several critics, including <ref target="/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle" title="Arthur Conan Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</ref>, a spiritualist himself, praising this version, calling it similar in style to Dickens' work; and for several decades the James version of Edwin Drood was common in America. Other Drood scholars disagree. John C. Walters "dismiss[ed it] with contempt", stating that the work "is self-condemned by its futility, illiteracy, and hideous American mannerisms; the mystery itself becomes a nightmare, and the solution only deepens the obscurity."<ref target="#cite_note-14">[14]</ref></p>
<p>Three of the most recent of the posthumous collaborations are The Mystery of Edwin Drood by <ref target="/wiki/Leon_Garfield" title="Leon Garfield">Leon Garfield</ref> (1980), The Decoding of Edwin Drood (1980) by Charles Forsyte and The Mystery of Edwin Drood by David Madden (2011).<ref target="#cite_note-15">[15]</ref> There was also a humorous continuation by the Italian duo <ref target="/wiki/Fruttero_%26_Lucentini" title="Fruttero & Lucentini">Fruttero & Lucentini</ref> entitled <ref target="/wiki/The_D_Case" title="The D Case">The D Case</ref>.</p>
<p>In 2015, the UK newspaper The Daily Mail and the University of Buckingham asked the public for their solution to the mystery. Out of 15,000 responses, the overwhelming verdict was that Jasper killed his own nephew and stashed his body in the church crypt, the same solution proposed by Dickens' friends and family.<ref target="#cite_note-16">[16]</ref></p>

<h2>The Trial of John Jasper[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mystery_of_Edwin_Drood&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: The Trial of John Jasper">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>In January 1914 the <ref target="/wiki/Dickens_Fellowship" title="Dickens Fellowship">Dickens Fellowship</ref> organised a dramatic "trial" in the King's Hall, Covent Garden. John Jasper (played by Frederick T. Harry) stood trial for the murder of Edwin Drood. <ref target="/wiki/G._K._Chesterton" title="G. K. Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</ref>, best known for the <ref target="/wiki/Father_Brown" title="Father Brown">Father Brown</ref> mystery stories, was the judge, and <ref target="/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw" title="George Bernard Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</ref> was the foreman of the jury, which was made up of other authors. J. Cuming Walters, author of The Complete Edwin Drood, led the prosecution, while <ref target="/wiki/Cecil_Chesterton" title="Cecil Chesterton">Cecil Chesterton</ref> acted for the defence.</p>
<p>Proceedings were very light-hearted; Shaw in particular made wisecracks at the expense of others present. For instance, Shaw claimed that if the prosecution thought that producing evidence would influence the jury then "he little knows his functions".<ref target="#cite_note-17">[17]</ref></p>
<p>The jury returned a verdict of <ref target="/wiki/Manslaughter" title="Manslaughter">manslaughter</ref>, Shaw stating that it was a compromise on the grounds that there was not enough evidence to convict Jasper but that they did not want to run the risk of being murdered in their beds. Both sides protested and demanded that the jury be discharged. Shaw claimed that the jury would be only too pleased to be discharged. Chesterton ruled that the mystery of Edwin Drood was insoluble and fined everyone, except himself, for contempt of court.<ref target="#cite_note-18">[18]</ref></p>

<h3>Theatre[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mystery_of_Edwin_Drood&action=edit&section=13" title="Edit section: Theatre">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Main article: <ref target="/wiki/Drood" title="Drood">Drood</ref></p>
<p>Following almost immediately on Charles Dickens's death, playwrights and theatre companies have mounted versions of The Mystery of Edwin Drood with varying degrees of popularity, success, and faithfulness to the original work.</p>
<p>The first modern major theatrical adaptation was a <ref target="/wiki/Musical_theatre" title="Musical theatre">musical comedy</ref> with book, music, and lyrics by <ref target="/wiki/Rupert_Holmes" title="Rupert Holmes">Rupert Holmes</ref>. Because Dickens's book was left unfinished, the musical hinges upon a novel idea: the audience decides by vote which of the characters is the murderer. The musical's suspect pool includes John Jasper, Neville Landless, Rosa Bud, Helena Landless, Rev. Crisparkle, Princess Puffer, and Mr. Bazzard. Adding further interactivity, the audience also chooses either Rosa Bud, Neville Landless, Helena Landless, Rev. Crisparkle, or Mr. Bazzard to play the role of Dick Datchery since the cast votes that Edwin Drood actually was murdered and cannot be Dick Datchery. As well, one male and one female character are chosen to develop a romance together: Holmes wrote brief alternate endings for every possible voting outcome, even the most unlikely. For reasons of dramatic variety, John Jasper is presented as a red herring in the final solution. The audience is discouraged to vote for him, and in the final scene, he confesses to the murder only for Durdles to reveal that Jasper hallucinated the attack on Drood after stumbling upon the scene of the murder, and disposed of the body thinking he had committed the crime himself.</p>
<p>The production, originally known by the full name of The Mystery of Edwin Drood, but re-titled halfway through its original run to simply Drood,<ref target="#cite_note-26">[26]</ref> was first produced in 1985 by the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_York_Shakespeare_Festival" title="New York Shakespeare Festival">New York Shakespeare Festival</ref>, and then transferred to Broadway, where it ran for 608 performances (and 24 previews). It won five 1986 <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Award" title="Tony Award">Tonys</ref>, including Best Musical, as well as <ref target="/wiki/Drama_Desk_Award" title="Drama Desk Award">Drama Desk</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Edgar_Award" title="Edgar Award">Edgar</ref> awards. The musical has since played successfully in numerous regional and amateur productions. In 2012, Aria Entertainment produced a London revival of the musical at the <ref target="/wiki/Landor_Theatre" title="Landor Theatre">Landor Theatre</ref> in April/May, which transferred to the <ref target="/wiki/Arts_Theatre" title="Arts Theatre">Arts Theatre</ref>, West End, for a limited season from 18 May to 17 June. The cast included former <ref target="/wiki/Coronation_Street" title="Coronation Street">Coronation Street</ref> star <ref target="/wiki/Wendi_Peters" title="Wendi Peters">Wendi Peters</ref> as Princess Puffer, with Natalie Day as Edwin Drood, Daniel Robinson as John Jasper and Victoria Farley as Rosa Budd. The production was directed by Matthew Gould.<ref target="#cite_note-27">[27]</ref></p>
<p>Most recently, a popular Broadway revival by the <ref target="/wiki/Roundabout_Theatre_Company" title="Roundabout Theatre Company">Roundabout Theatre Company</ref><ref target="#cite_note-28">[28]</ref> was incorporated into its 2012–2013 season. It was directed by <ref target="/wiki/Scott_Ellis" title="Scott Ellis">Scott Ellis</ref> and starred <ref target="/wiki/Chita_Rivera" title="Chita Rivera">Chita Rivera</ref> as Princess Puffer and <ref target="/wiki/Stephanie_J._Block" title="Stephanie J.

The final "Murderer" tabulations assigned to each of the characters and the identity of "Datchery" were displayed overhead on chalkboards in the foyer, visible to the departing audience.</p>
