<p>A Man for All Seasons is a play by <ref target="/wiki/Robert_Bolt" title="Robert Bolt">Robert Bolt</ref> based on the life of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sir_Thomas_More" title="Sir Thomas More">Sir Thomas More</ref>. An early form of the play had been written for <ref target="/wiki/BBC_Radio" title="BBC Radio">BBC Radio</ref> in 1954, and a one-hour live television version starring <ref target="/wiki/Bernard_Hepton" title="Bernard Hepton">Bernard Hepton</ref> was produced in 1957 by the BBC,<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref> but after Bolt's success with The Flowering Cherry, he reworked it for the stage.</p>
<p>It was first performed in London opening at the <ref target="/wiki/Gielgud_Theatre" title="Gielgud Theatre">Globe Theatre</ref> (now Gielgud Theatre) on 1 July 1960.

<h2>Title[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=A_Man_for_All_Seasons&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Title">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The title reflects 20th century agnostic playwright <ref target="/wiki/Robert_Bolt" title="Robert Bolt">Robert Bolt</ref>’s portrayal of More as the ultimate man of <ref target="/wiki/Conscience" title="Conscience">conscience</ref>. As one who remains true to himself and his beliefs while adapting to all circumstances and times, despite external pressure or influence, More represents "a man for all seasons." Bolt borrowed the title from <ref target="/wiki/Robert_Whittington" title="Robert Whittington">Robert Whittington</ref>, a contemporary of More, who in 1520 wrote of him:</p>

<p>"More is a man of an angel's wit and singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness, lowliness and affability? And, as time requireth, a man of marvelous mirth and pastimes, and sometime of as sad gravity. A man for all seasons."<ref target="#cite_note-2">[2]</ref></p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Hans_Holbein,_the_Younger_-_Sir_Thomas_More_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Hans_Holbein,_the_Younger_-_Sir_Thomas_More_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>Sir <ref target="/wiki/Thomas_More" title="Thomas More">Thomas More</ref>, one of the most famous early Lord Chancellors, served and was executed under King <ref target="/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</ref>.
<p>A Man for All Seasons struggles with ideas of identity and conscience. More argues repeatedly that a person is defined by his <ref target="/wiki/Conscience" title="Conscience">conscience</ref>. His own position is depicted as almost indefensible; the <ref target="/wiki/Pope_Clement_VII" title="Pope Clement VII">Pope</ref> is described as a "bad" and corrupt individual, forced by the <ref target="/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor">Emperor Charles V</ref> to act according to his will. But as More says to Norfolk, "What matters is not that it's true, but that I believe it; or no, not that I believe it, but that I believe it." More fears that if he breaks with his conscience, he will be damned to hell, while his associates and friends are more concerned with holding onto their own temporal power.</p>
<p>At another key point of the play, More testifies before an inquiry committee and Norfolk attempts to persuade him to sign the <ref target="/wiki/Act_Respecting_the_Oath_to_the_Succession" title="Act Respecting the Oath to the Succession">Succession to the Crown Act 1534</ref> (pp. 78, Heinemann edition):</p>
<p>Norfolk:</p>

<p>Oh, confound all this. ... I'm not a scholar, as Master Cromwell never tires of pointing out, and frankly, I don't know whether the marriage was lawful or not. But damn it, Thomas, look at those names. ... You know those men! Can't you do what I did, and come with us, for fellowship?</p>
<p>More:</p>

<p>And when we stand before God, and you are sent to Paradise for doing according to your conscience, and I am damned for not doing according to mine, will you come with me, for fellowship?</p>
<p>More's persecution is made to seem even more unjust by the inclusion of <ref target="/wiki/Eustace_Chapuys" title="Eustace Chapuys">Eustace Chapuys</ref>, the long-time Imperial ambassador to England, in the story. Chapuys recognizes More as a stout man of the church, and in Act II, after More's resignation from the Chancellorship, he informs More of a planned rebellion along the Scottish border, expecting More to be sympathetic. Instead, More informs Norfolk of the plot, showing him to be patriotic and loyal to the King. This, along with More's refusal to speak out against the King, shows him to be a loyal subject, and thus Cromwell appears to prosecute him out of personal spite and because he disagrees with the King's divorce.</p>
<p>Bolt also establishes an anti-authoritarian theme which recurs throughout his works. All people in positions of power – King Henry, Cromwell, Wolsey, Cranmer, Chapuys, even Norfolk – are depicted as being either corrupt, evil, or at best expedient and power-hungry. Bolt's later plays and film screenplays also delve into this theme. The theme of corruption is also illustrated, in Rich's rise to power, the Common Man being drawn into the events of the storyline, and in the (deliberately) anachronistic portrayal of Henry as a younger, athletic man (in 1530 he would have been almost forty and already putting on weight).</p>
<p>Although it is the law that eventually forces More's execution, the play also makes several powerful statements in support of the rule of law. At one point More's future son-in-law, Roper, urges him to arrest Richard Rich, whose perjury will eventually lead to More's execution. More answers that Rich has broken no law, "And go he should if he were the Devil himself until he broke the law!" Roper is appalled at the idea of granting the Devil the benefit of law, but More is adamant.</p>

<p>"What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? ... And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you – where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws from coast to coast, Man's laws, not God's, and if you cut them down – and you're just the man to do it – do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake!"</p>
<p>The character of the Common Man serves as a narrator and framing device. A <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brecht" title="Brecht">Brechtian</ref> character, he plays various small parts – More's servant, a publican, a boatman, More's jailer, jury foreman and executioner—who appear throughout the play, both taking part in and commenting on the action. Several sequences involving this character break the <ref target="/wiki/Fourth_wall" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</ref>—most notably, a sequence where the Common Man attempts to exit the stage and is addressed by Cromwell, who identifies him as a jury foreman. (Indeed, the "jury" consists of sticks or poles with the hats of the Common Man's various characters put on top.) The place of the Common Man in history is emphasized when he says in his opening speech,</p>
<p>"the sixteenth century was the century of the Common Man-like all the other centuries."</p>
<p>Bolt created the Common Man for two main reasons: to illustrate the place and influence of the average person in history, even though they are usually overlooked, and to try to prevent the audience from sympathising with the more titled characters such as More, realising that the audience is more closely related to him—a classic case of Brechtian <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alienation_effect" title="Alienation effect">alienation</ref>. The character's role in the story has been interpreted in many different ways by different critics, from being a positive to a negative character. Bolt's own view (expressed in the preface to the play) was that he was intended to draw the audience into the play and that "common" denoted "that which is common to us all." <ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> Several of Bolt's subsequent works feature similar characters (e.g. The Thwarting of Baron Bolligrew, <ref target="/wiki/State_of_Revolution" title="State of Revolution">State of Revolution</ref>).</p>

<p>Two different endings were written by Bolt. The original ending, performed during the show's preliminary run in England, had Cromwell and Chapuys confront each other after More's execution and then exit the stage, hand in hand, chuckling with "the self-mocking, self-indulgent, rather rueful laughter of the men who know what the world is and how to be comfortable in it".</p>
<p>This particular ending is exemplary of Bolt's notion of "riding with the current", as is demonstrated by "men who know what the world is and how to be comfortable in it", forsaking one's conscience in exchange of a life of "convenience". For the show's London production – and most, if not all, subsequent runs of the show – the Common Man sheds his executioner's garb and addresses the audience one final time:</p>

<p>"... It isn't difficult to keep alive, friends – just don't make trouble – or if you must make trouble, make the sort of trouble that's expected... If we should bump into one another, recognize me."</p>
<p>The <ref target="/wiki/A_Man_for_All_Seasons_(1966_film)" title="A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)">film version</ref> of the play ends with More's execution, followed by a narrator reading off the fates of the various characters involved (originally, this was dialogue spoken by the Common Man prior to the Tower of London Inquiry).</p>

<p>The Broadway production was a huge hit, running for 620 performances. While the play had drawn mixed critical reviews in London, it was almost unanimously praised by the New York critics, who showered it with plaudits and awards.</p>
<p>Leo McKern played the Common Man in the West End version of the show, but was shifted to the role of Cromwell for the Broadway production – a role he later reprised in the film. While playing Cromwell, he appeared with one brown and one blue eye (McKern of course had lost an eye in an accident and wore a glass one) to accentuate his character's evil nature.</p>
<ref target="/wiki/Charlton_Heston" title="Charlton Heston">Charlton Heston</ref> played More in several versions of the play-off-Broadway in the 1970s and 1980s, eventually playing it in the West End. The play was a success and the West End production was taken to Aberdeen, Scotland, for a week where it was staged at His Majesty's Theatre. Heston considered it among his favourite roles. He also produced, directed, and starred in a film version of it (see below). The production gained a sort of notoriety when Dustin Hoffman spread the story that Heston, who was bald, was so vain that he wore a wig over his hairpiece, rather than let the public view his actual bald pate.
<p>Another famous graduate of the play is <ref target="/wiki/Ian_McKellen" title="Ian McKellen">Ian McKellen</ref>, whose first theatrical role was as Will Roper in a revival production in the late 1960s. He would go on to play More in a later run of the show. <ref target="/wiki/Faye_Dunaway" title="Faye Dunaway">Faye Dunaway</ref> also made her stage debut as a replacement Margaret in the original Broadway run.</p>
<p>An acclaimed Canadian production starring <ref target="/wiki/William_Hutt_(actor)" title="William Hutt (actor)">William Hutt</ref> and directed by <ref target="/wiki/Walter_Learning" title="Walter Learning">Walter Learning</ref> was presented at the <ref target="/wiki/Vancouver_Playhouse_(theatre_venue)" title="Vancouver Playhouse (theatre venue)">Vancouver Playhouse</ref> and the <ref target="/wiki/Stratford_Festival" title="Stratford Festival">Stratford Festival</ref> in 1986. At Stratford the production was paired with a production of Shakespeare's Henry VIII, with both plays sharing many actors, and showing two perspectives on historical events.</p>
<p>The play was staged in London's West End at the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Haymarket_Theatre" title="Haymarket Theatre">Theatre Royal, Haymarket</ref> starring <ref target="/wiki/Martin_Shaw" title="Martin Shaw">Martin Shaw</ref> and produced by <ref target="/wiki/Bill_Kenwright" title="Bill Kenwright">Bill Kenwright</ref>. It closed on 1 April 2006.</p>
