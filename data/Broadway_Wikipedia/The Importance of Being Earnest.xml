<p>The Importance of Being Earnest<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest_-_Cigarettecase.jpg"></ref>The original production of The Importance of Being Earnest in 1895 with <ref target="/wiki/Allan_Aynesworth" title="Allan Aynesworth">Allan Aynesworth</ref> as Algernon (left) and <ref target="/wiki/George_Alexander_(actor)" title="George Alexander (actor)">George Alexander</ref> as John (right)Written by<ref target="/wiki/Oscar_Wilde" title="Oscar Wilde">Oscar Wilde</ref>Date premiered1895Place premiered<ref target="/wiki/St_James%27s_Theatre" title="St James's Theatre">St James's Theatre</ref>,London, EnglandOriginal languageEnglishGenreComedy, farceSettingLondon and an estate in <ref target="/wiki/Hertfordshire" title="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</ref></p>
<p>The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by <ref target="/wiki/Oscar_Wilde" title="Oscar Wilde">Oscar Wilde</ref>. First performed on 14 February 1895 at the <ref target="/wiki/St_James%27s_Theatre" title="St James's Theatre">St James's Theatre</ref> in London, it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of <ref target="/wiki/Victorian_morality" title="Victorian morality">Victorian ways</ref>. Some contemporary reviews praised the play's humour and the culmination of Wilde's artistic career, while others were cautious about its lack of social messages. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play.</p>
<p>The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde's career but also heralded his downfall. The <ref target="/wiki/John_Douglas,_9th_Marquess_of_Queensberry" title="John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry">Marquess of Queensberry</ref>, whose son <ref target="/wiki/Lord_Alfred_Douglas" title="Lord Alfred Douglas">Lord Alfred Douglas</ref> was Wilde's lover, planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show. Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission. Their feud came to a climax in court, where Wilde's homosexuality was revealed to the Victorian public and he was sentenced to imprisonment. Despite the play's early success, Wilde's notoriety caused the play to be closed after 86 performances. After his release from prison, he published the play from exile in Paris, but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work.</p>
<p>The Importance of Being Earnest has been revived many times since its premiere. It has been adapted for the cinema on three occasions. In <ref target="/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest_(1952_film)" title="The Importance of Being Earnest (1952 film)">The Importance of Being Earnest</ref> (1952), <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dame_Edith_Evans" title="Dame Edith Evans">Dame Edith Evans</ref> reprised her celebrated interpretation of Lady Bracknell; The Importance of Being Earnest (1992) by Kurt Baker used an all-black cast; and <ref target="/wiki/Oliver_Parker" title="Oliver Parker">Oliver Parker</ref>'s <ref target="/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest_(2002_film)" title="The Importance of Being Earnest (2002 film)">The Importance of Being Earnest</ref> (2002) incorporated some of Wilde's original material cut during the preparation of the original stage production.</p>

<p>After the success of Wilde's plays <ref target="/wiki/Lady_Windermere%27s_Fan" title="Lady Windermere's Fan">Lady Windermere's Fan</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/A_Woman_of_No_Importance" title="A Woman of No Importance">A Woman of No Importance</ref>, Wilde's producers urged him to write further plays. In July 1894, he mooted his idea for The Importance of Being Earnest to <ref target="/wiki/George_Alexander_(actor)" title="George Alexander (actor)">George Alexander</ref>, the actor-manager of the <ref target="/wiki/St_James%27s_Theatre" title="St James's Theatre">St James's Theatre</ref>. Wilde spent the summer with his family at <ref target="/wiki/Worthing" title="Worthing">Worthing</ref>, where he wrote the play quickly in August.<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref> His fame now at its peak, he used the working title Lady Lancing to avoid preemptive speculation of its content.<ref target="#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> Many names and ideas in the play were borrowed from people or places the author had known; Lady Queensberry, <ref target="/wiki/Lord_Alfred_Douglas" title="Lord Alfred Douglas">Lord Alfred Douglas</ref>'s mother, for example, lived at Bracknell.<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-6">[n 1]</ref> Wilde scholars agree the most important influence on the play was <ref target="/wiki/W._S._Gilbert" title="W. S. Gilbert">W. S. Gilbert</ref>'s 1877 farce <ref target="/wiki/Engaged_(play)" title="Engaged (play)">Engaged</ref>,<ref target="#cite_note-7">[6]</ref> from which Wilde borrowed not only several incidents but also "the gravity of tone demanded by Gilbert of his actors".<ref target="#cite_note-8">[7]</ref></p>
<p>Wilde continually revised the text over the next months. No line was left untouched and the revision had significant consequences.<ref target="#cite_note-jackson163-9">[8]</ref> Sos Eltis describes Wilde's revisions as refined art at work. The earliest and longest handwritten drafts of the play labour over farcical incidents, broad puns, nonsense dialogue and conventional comic turns. In revising, "Wilde transformed standard nonsense into the more systemic and disconcerting illogicality which characterises Earnest's dialogue".<ref target="#cite_note-Eltis177-10">[9]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Richard_Ellmann" title="Richard Ellmann">Richard Ellmann</ref> argues Wilde had reached his artistic maturity and wrote more surely and rapidly.<ref target="#cite_note-Ellmann398-11">[10]</ref></p>
<p>Wilde hesitated about submitting the script to Alexander, worrying it might be unsuitable for the St James's Theatre, whose typical repertoire was more serious, and explaining it had been written in response to a request for a play "with no real serious interest".<ref target="#cite_note-Raby_1997:165-12">[11]</ref> When <ref target="/wiki/Henry_James" title="Henry James">Henry James</ref>'s <ref target="/wiki/Guy_Domville" title="Guy Domville">Guy Domville</ref> failed, Alexander agreed to put on Wilde's play.<ref target="#cite_note-jackson163-9">[8]</ref> After working with Wilde on stage movements with a toy theatre, Alexander asked the author to shorten the play from four acts to three. Wilde agreed and combined elements of the second and third acts.<ref target="#cite_note-Ellmann_1988:406-13">[12]</ref> The largest cut was the removal of the character of Mr. Gribsby, a solicitor who comes from London to arrest the profligate "Ernest" (i.e., Jack) for unpaid dining bills.<ref target="#cite_note-jackson163-9">[8]</ref> The four-act version was first played on a BBC radio production and is still sometimes performed. Some consider the three-act structure more effective and theatrically resonant than the expanded published edition.<ref target="#cite_note-Raby121-14">[13]</ref></p>

G. Wells">H. G. Wells</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw" title="George Bernard Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</ref>
<p>In contrast to much theatre of the time, the light plot of The Importance of Being Earnest does not tackle serious social and political issues, something of which contemporary reviewers were wary. Though unsure of Wilde's seriousness as a dramatist, they recognised the play's cleverness, humour and popularity with audiences.<ref target="#cite_note-Jackson_1997:172-25">[22]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw" title="George Bernard Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</ref>, for example, reviewed the play in the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Saturday_Review_(London)" title="Saturday Review (London)">Saturday Review</ref>, arguing that comedy should touch as well as amuse, "I go to the theatre to be moved to laughter."<ref target="#cite_note-26">[23]</ref> Later in a letter he said, the play, though "extremely funny", was Wilde's "first really heartless [one]".<ref target="#cite_note-27">[24]</ref> In The World, <ref target="/wiki/William_Archer_(critic)" title="William Archer (critic)">William Archer</ref> wrote that he had enjoyed watching the play but found it to be empty of meaning: "What can a poor critic do with a play which raises no principle, whether of art or morals, creates its own canons and conventions, and is nothing but an absolutely wilful expression of an irrepressibly witty personality?"<ref target="#cite_note-28">[25]</ref></p>
<p>In The Speaker, <ref target="/wiki/Arthur_Bingham_Walkley" title="Arthur Bingham Walkley">A. B. Walkley</ref> admired the play and was one of few to see it as the culmination of Wilde's dramatic career. He denied the term "farce" was derogatory, or even lacking in seriousness, and said "It is of nonsense all compact, and better nonsense, I think, our stage has not seen."<ref target="#cite_note-Beckson_196-29">[26]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/H._G._Wells" title="H. G. Wells">H. G. Wells</ref>, in an unsigned review for <ref target="/wiki/The_Pall_Mall_Gazette" title="The Pall Mall Gazette">The Pall Mall Gazette</ref>, called Earnest one of the freshest comedies of the year, saying "More humorous dealing with theatrical conventions it would be difficult to imagine."<ref target="#cite_note-Beckson_1970:188-30">[27]</ref> He also questioned whether people would fully see its message, "... how Serious People will take this Trivial Comedy intended for their learning remains to be seen. No doubt seriously."<ref target="#cite_note-Beckson_1970:188-30">[27]</ref> The play was so light-hearted that many reviewers compared it to comic opera rather than drama. <ref target="/wiki/W._H._Auden" title="W. H. Auden">W. H. Auden</ref> later[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers">when?</ref>] called it "a pure verbal opera", and <ref target="/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The Times</ref> commented, "The story is almost too preposterous to go without music."<ref target="#cite_note-jackson171-18">[17]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Mary_McCarthy_(author)" title="Mary McCarthy (author)">Mary McCarthy</ref>, in Sights and Spectacles (1959), however, and despite thinking the play extremely funny, called it "a ferocious idyll"; "depravity is the hero and the only character."<ref target="#cite_note-31">[28]</ref></p>
<p>The Importance of Being Earnest is Wilde's most popular work and is continually revived.<ref target="#cite_note-Raby_1997:165-12">[11]</ref> Max Beerbohm called the play Wilde's "finest, most undeniably his own", saying that in his other comedies—Lady Windermere's Fan, A Woman of No Importance and <ref target="/wiki/An_Ideal_Husband" title="An Ideal Husband">An Ideal Husband</ref>—the plot, following the manner of <ref target="/wiki/Victorien_Sardou" title="Victorien Sardou">Victorien Sardou</ref>, is unrelated to the theme of the work, while in Earnest the story is "dissolved" into the form of the play.<ref target="#cite_note-32">[29]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-34">[n 4]</ref></p>

<h3>Revivals[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Revivals">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The Importance of Being Earnest and Wilde's three other society plays were performed in Britain during the author's imprisonment and exile, albeit by small touring companies. A. B. Tapping's company toured Earnest between October 1895 and March 1899 (their performance at the Theatre Royal, Limerick, in the last week of October 1895 was almost certainly the first production of the play in Ireland). Elsie Lanham's company also toured 'Earnest' between November 1899 and April 1900.<ref target="#cite_note-35">[31]</ref> Alexander revived Earnest in a small theatre in <ref target="/wiki/Notting_Hill" title="Notting Hill">Notting Hill</ref>, outside the West End, in 1901;<ref target="#cite_note-36">[32]</ref> in the same year he presented the piece on tour, playing Jack Worthing with a cast including the young <ref target="/wiki/Lilian_Braithwaite" title="Lilian Braithwaite">Lilian Braithwaite</ref> as Cecily.<ref target="#cite_note-37">[33]</ref> The play returned to the West End when Alexander presented a revival at the St James's in 1902.<ref target="#cite_note-38">[34]</ref> Broadway revivals were mounted in 1902<ref target="#cite_note-hischak-22">[20]</ref> and again in 1910,<ref target="#cite_note-39">[35]</ref> each production running for six weeks.<ref target="#cite_note-hischak-22">[20]</ref></p>
<p>A collected edition of Wilde's works, published in 1908 and edited by <ref target="/wiki/Robbie_Ross" title="Robbie Ross">Robert Ross</ref>, helped to restore his reputation as an author. Alexander presented another revival of Earnest at the St James's in 1909, when he and Aynesworth reprised their original roles;<ref target="#cite_note-40">[36]</ref> the revival ran for 316 performances.<ref target="#cite_note-ga-19">[18]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Max_Beerbohm" title="Max Beerbohm">Max Beerbohm</ref> said that the play was sure to become a classic of the English repertory, and that its humour was as fresh then as when it had been written, adding that the actors had "worn as well as the play".<ref target="#cite_note-Beerbohm510-41">[37]</ref></p>
<p>For a 1913 revival at the same theatre the young actors <ref target="/wiki/Gerald_Ames" title="Gerald Ames">Gerald Ames</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/A._E._Matthews" title="A. E. Matthews">A. E.

<h2>Synopsis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Synopsis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The play is set in "The Present" (i.e. 1895).<ref target="#cite_note-75">[67]</ref></p>

<h3>Act I: Algernon Moncrieff's flat in Half Moon Street, W[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest&action=edit&section=7" title="Edit section: Act I: Algernon Moncrieff's flat in Half Moon Street, W">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The play opens with Algernon Moncrieff, an idle young <ref target="/wiki/Gentleman" title="Gentleman">gentleman</ref>, receiving his best friend, Jack Worthing ('Ernest'). Ernest has come from the country to propose to Algernon's cousin, Gwendolen Fairfax. Algernon refuses to consent until Ernest explains why his cigarette case bears the inscription, "From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack." 'Ernest' is forced to admit to living a double life. In the country, he assumes a serious attitude for the benefit of his young <ref target="/wiki/Ward_(law)" title="Ward (law)">ward</ref>, the <ref target="/wiki/Inheritance" title="Inheritance">heiress</ref> Cecily Cardew, and goes by the name of John (or Jack), while pretending that he must worry about a wastrel younger brother named Ernest in London. In the city, meanwhile, he assumes the identity of the <ref target="/wiki/Libertine" title="Libertine">libertine</ref> Ernest. Algernon confesses a similar deception: he pretends to have an invalid friend named Bunbury in the country, whom he can "visit" whenever he wishes to avoid an unwelcome social obligation. Jack refuses to tell Algernon the location of his country estate.</p>
<p>Gwendolen and her formidable mother Lady Bracknell now call on Algernon who distracts Lady Bracknell in another room while Jack proposes to Gwendolen. She accepts, but seems to love him in large part because of his name, Ernest. Jack accordingly resolves to himself to be rechristened "Ernest". Discovering them in this intimate exchange, Lady Bracknell interviews Jack as a prospective suitor. Horrified to learn that he was adopted after being discovered as a baby in a handbag at Victoria Station, she refuses him and forbids further contact with her daughter. Gwendolen manages to covertly promise to him her undying love. As Jack gives her his address in the country, Algernon surreptitiously notes it on the cuff of his sleeve: Jack's revelation of his pretty and wealthy young ward has motivated his friend to meet her.</p>

<h3>Act II: The Garden of the Manor House, Woolton[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: Act II: The Garden of the Manor House, Woolton">edit</ref>]</h3>

<p>Cecily is studying with her <ref target="/wiki/Governess" title="Governess">governess</ref>, Miss Prism. Algernon arrives, pretending to be Ernest Worthing, and soon charms Cecily. Long fascinated by Uncle Jack's hitherto absent <ref target="/wiki/Black_sheep" title="Black sheep">black sheep</ref> brother, she is predisposed to fall for Algernon in his role of Ernest (a name she is apparently particularly fond of). Therefore, Algernon, too, plans for the <ref target="/wiki/Rector_(ecclesiastical)" title="Rector (ecclesiastical)">rector</ref>, Dr. Chasuble, to rechristen him "Ernest". Jack has decided to abandon his double life. He arrives in full mourning and announces his brother's death in Paris of a severe chill, a story undermined by Algernon's presence in the guise of Ernest. Gwendolen now enters, having run away from home. During the temporary absence of the two men, she meets Cecily, each woman indignantly declaring that she is the one engaged to "Ernest". When Jack and Algernon reappear, their deceptions are exposed.</p>

<h3>Act III: Morning-Room at the Manor House, Woolton[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest&action=edit&section=9" title="Edit section: Act III: Morning-Room at the Manor House, Woolton">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Arriving in pursuit of her daughter, Lady Bracknell is astonished to be told that Algernon and Cecily are engaged. The revelation of Cecily's wealth soon dispels Lady Bracknell's initial doubts over the young lady's suitability, but any engagement is forbidden by her <ref target="/wiki/Legal_guardian" title="Legal guardian">guardian</ref> Jack: he will consent only if Lady Bracknell agrees to his own union with Gwendolen—something she declines to do.</p>
<p>The impasse is broken by the return of Miss Prism, whom Lady Bracknell recognises as the person who, 28 years earlier as a family nursemaid, had taken a baby boy for a walk in a <ref target="/wiki/Baby_transport#Prams" title="Baby transport">perambulator</ref> and never returned. Challenged, Miss Prism explains that she had absent mindedly put the manuscript of a novel she was writing in the perambulator, and the baby in a handbag, which she had left at Victoria Station. Jack produces the very same handbag, showing that he is the lost baby, the elder son of Lady Bracknell's late sister, and thus Algernon's elder brother. Having acquired such respectable relations, he is acceptable as a suitor for Gwendolen after all.</p>
<p>Gwendolen, however, insists she can love only a man named Ernest. Lady Bracknell informs Jack that, as the first-born, he would have been named after his father, General Moncrieff. Jack examines the army lists and discovers that his father's name—and hence his own real name—was in fact Ernest. Pretence was reality all along. As the happy couples embrace—Jack and Gwendolen, Algernon and Cecily, and even Dr. Chasuble and Miss Prism—Lady Bracknell complains to her newfound relative: "My nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of triviality." "On the contrary, Aunt Augusta", he replies, "I've now realised for the first time in my life the vital importance of being Earnest."</p>

<h3>Triviality[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest&action=edit&section=12" title="Edit section: Triviality">edit</ref>]</h3>
<ref target="/wiki/Arthur_Ransome" title="Arthur Ransome">Arthur Ransome</ref> described The Importance... as the most trivial of Wilde's society plays, and the only one that produces "that peculiar exhilaration of the spirit by which we recognise the beautiful." "It is", he wrote, "precisely because it is consistently trivial that it is not ugly."<ref target="#cite_note-76">[68]</ref> Ellmann says that The Importance of Being Earnest touched on many themes Wilde had been building since the 1880s—the languor of aesthetic poses was well established and Wilde takes it as a starting point for the two protagonists.<ref target="#cite_note-Ellmann398-11">[10]</ref> While <ref target="/wiki/Salome_(play)" title="Salome (play)">Salome</ref>, An Ideal Husband and <ref target="/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray" title="The Picture of Dorian Gray">The Picture of Dorian Gray</ref> had dwelt on more serious wrongdoing, vice in Earnest is represented by Algy's craving for <ref target="/wiki/Cucumber_sandwich" title="Cucumber sandwich">cucumber sandwiches</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-78">[n 9]</ref> Wilde told Robert Ross that the play's theme was "That we should treat all trivial things in life very seriously, and all serious things of life with a sincere and studied triviality."<ref target="#cite_note-Ellmann398-11">[10]</ref> The theme is hinted at in the play's ironic title, and "earnestness" is repeatedly alluded to in the dialogue, Algernon says in Act II, "one has to be serious about something if one is to have any amusement in life" but goes on to reproach Jack for 'being serious about everything'".<ref target="#cite_note-Pablé_2005:302-79">[70]</ref> Blackmail and corruption had haunted the double lives of Dorian Gray and Sir Robert Chiltern (in An Ideal Husband), but in Earnest the protagonists' duplicity (Algernon's "bunburying" and Worthing's double life as Jack and Ernest) is undertaken for more innocent purposes—largely to avoid unwelcome social obligations.<ref target="#cite_note-Ellmann398-11">[10]</ref> While much theatre of the time tackled serious social and political issues, Earnest is superficially about nothing at all. It "refuses to play the game" of other dramatists of the period, for instance Bernard Shaw, who used their characters to draw audiences to grander ideals.<ref target="#cite_note-Jackson_1997:172-25">[22]</ref>

<h3>As a satire of society[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest&action=edit&section=13" title="Edit section: As a satire of society">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The play repeatedly mocks Victorian traditions and social customs, marriage and the pursuit of love in particular.<ref target="#cite_note-80">[71]</ref> In <ref target="/wiki/Victorian_era" title="Victorian era">Victorian times</ref> earnestness was considered to be the over-riding societal value, originating in religious attempts to reform the lower classes, it spread to the upper ones too throughout the century.<ref target="#cite_note-Pablé_2005:301-81">[72]</ref> The play's very title, with its mocking paradox (serious people are so because they do not see trivial comedies), introduces the theme, it continues in the drawing room discussion, "Yes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not serious about meals. It is so shallow of them," says Algernon in Act 1; allusions are quick and from multiple angles.<ref target="#cite_note-Pablé_2005:302-79">[70]</ref></p>

<p>Wilde managed both to engage with and to mock the genre, while providing social commentary and offering reform.<ref target="#cite_note-82">[73]</ref> The men follow traditional matrimonial rites, whereby suitors admit their weaknesses to their prospective brides, but the foibles they excuse are ridiculous, and the farce is built on an absurd confusion of a book and a baby.<ref target="#cite_note-83">[74]</ref> When Jack apologises to Gwendolen during his marriage proposal it is for not being wicked:<ref target="#cite_note-84">[75]</ref></p>


<p>JACK: Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth. Can you forgive me?</p>

<p>GWENDOLEN: I can. For I feel that you are sure to change. </p>
<p>In turn, both Gwendolen and Cecily have the ideal of marrying a man named Ernest, a popular and respected name at the time. Gwendolen, quite unlike her mother's methodical analysis of John Worthing's suitability as a husband, places her entire faith in a Christian name, declaring in Act I, "The only really safe name is Ernest".<ref target="#cite_note-85">[76]</ref> This is an opinion shared by Cecily in Act II, "I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not called Ernest"<ref target="#cite_note-86">[77]</ref> and they indignantly declare that they have been deceived when they find out the men's real names.</p>
<p>Wilde embodied society's rules and rituals artfully into Lady Bracknell: minute attention to the details of her style created a comic effect of assertion by restraint.<ref target="#cite_note-87">[78]</ref> In contrast to her encyclopaedic knowledge of the social distinctions of London's street names, Jack's obscure parentage is subtly evoked. He defends himself against her "A handbag?" with the clarification, "The Brighton Line". At the time, <ref target="/wiki/London_Victoria_station" title="London Victoria station">Victoria Station</ref> consisted of two separate but adjacent terminal stations sharing the same name. To the east was the ramshackle <ref target="/wiki/London,_Chatham_and_Dover_Railway" title="London, Chatham and Dover Railway">LC&D Railway</ref>, on the west the up-market <ref target="/wiki/London,_Brighton_and_South_Coast_Railway" title="London, Brighton and South Coast Railway">LB&SCR</ref>—the Brighton Line, which went to <ref target="/wiki/Worthing" title="Worthing">Worthing</ref>, the fashionable, expensive town the gentleman who found baby Jack was travelling to at the time (and after which Jack was named).<ref target="#cite_note-88">[79]</ref></p>

<h3>Suggested homosexual subtext[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest&action=edit&section=14" title="Edit section: Suggested homosexual subtext">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>It has been argued that the play's themes of duplicity and ambivalence are inextricably bound up with Wilde's homosexuality, and that the play exhibits a "flickering presence-absence of… homosexual desire".<ref target="#cite_note-Craft-89">[80]</ref> On re-reading the play after his release from prison, Wilde said: "It was extraordinary reading the play over. How I used to toy with that Tiger Life."<ref target="#cite_note-Craft-89">[80]</ref> As one scholar has put it, the absolute necessity for homosexuals of the period to "need a public mask is a factor contributing to the satire on social disguise."<ref target="#cite_note-90">[81]</ref></p>
<p>The use of the name Earnest may have been a homosexual in-joke. In 1892, three years before Wilde wrote the play, John Gambril Nicholson had published the book of pederastic poetry Love in Earnest. The sonnet Of Boys' Names included the verse: "Though Frank may ring like silver bell / And Cecil softer music claim / They cannot work the miracle / –'Tis Ernest sets my heart a-flame."<ref target="#cite_note-91">[82]</ref> The word "earnest" may also have been a code-word for homosexual, as in: "Is he earnest?", in the same way that "Is he so?" and "Is he musical?" were employed.<ref target="#cite_note-92">[83]</ref></p>
<ref target="/wiki/Donald_Sinden" title="Donald Sinden">Sir Donald Sinden</ref>, an actor who had met two of the play's original cast (Irene Vanbrugh and Allan Aynesworth), and Lord Alfred Douglas, wrote to The Times to dispute suggestions that "Earnest" held any sexual connotations:<ref target="#cite_note-jg-93">[84]</ref>

<p>Although they had ample opportunity, at no time did any of them even hint that "Earnest" was a synonym for homosexual, or that "bunburying" may have implied homosexual sex. The first time I heard it mentioned was in the 1980s and I immediately consulted Sir John Gielgud whose own performance of Jack Worthing in the same play was legendary and whose knowledge of theatrical lore was encyclopaedic. He replied in his ringing tones: "No-No! Nonsense, absolute nonsense: I would have known".<ref target="#cite_note-jg-93">[84]</ref></p>
<p>A number of theories have also been put forward to explain the derivation of Bunbury, and Bunburying, which are used in the play to imply a secretive double life. It may have derived from Henry Shirley Bunbury, a hypochondriacal acquaintance of Wilde's youth.<ref target="#cite_note-94">[85]</ref> Another suggestion, put forward in 1913 by <ref target="/wiki/Aleister_Crowley" title="Aleister Crowley">Aleister Crowley</ref>, who knew Wilde, was that Bunbury was a combination word: that Wilde had once taken a train to <ref target="/wiki/Banbury" title="Banbury">Banbury</ref>, met a schoolboy there, and arranged a second secret meeting with him at <ref target="/wiki/Sunbury-on-Thames" title="Sunbury-on-Thames">Sunbury</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-95">[86]</ref></p>

<h2>Bunburying[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest&action=edit&section=15" title="Edit section: Bunburying">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Bunburying is a stratagem used by people who need an excuse for avoiding social obligations in their daily life. The word "bunburying" first appears in Act I when Algernon explains that he invented a fictional friend, a chronic invalid named "Bunbury", to have an excuse for getting out of events he does not wish to attend, particularly with his Aunt Augusta (Lady Bracknell). Algernon and Jack both use this method to secretly visit their lovers, Cecily and Gwendolen.<ref target="#cite_note-96">[87]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-97">[88]</ref></p>

<h2>Dramatic analysis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest&action=edit&section=16" title="Edit section: Dramatic analysis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Use of language[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest&action=edit&section=17" title="Edit section: Use of language">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>While Wilde had long been famous for dialogue and his use of language, Raby (1988) argues that he achieved a unity and mastery in Earnest that was unmatched in his other plays, except perhaps Salomé. While his earlier comedies suffer from an unevenness resulting from the thematic clash between the trivial and the serious, Earnest achieves a pitch-perfect style that allows these to dissolve.<ref target="#cite_note-Raby_1988:125-98">[89]</ref> There are three different registers detectable in the play. The dandyish insouciance of Jack and Algernon—established early with Algernon's exchange with his manservant—betrays an underlying unity despite their differing attitudes. The formidable pronouncements of Lady Bracknell are as startling for her use of hyperbole and rhetorical extravagance as for her disconcerting opinions. In contrast, the speech of Dr. Chasuble and Miss Prism is distinguished by "pedantic precept" and "idiosyncratic diversion".<ref target="#cite_note-Raby_1988:125-98">[89]</ref> Furthermore, the play is full of epigrams and paradoxes. Max Beerbohm described it as littered with "chiselled apophthegms—witticisms unrelated to action or character", of which he found half a dozen to be of the highest order.<ref target="#cite_note-Beerbohm510-41">[37]</ref></p>
<p>Lady Bracknell's line, "A handbag?", has been called one of the most malleable in English drama, lending itself to interpretations ranging from incredulous or scandalised to baffled. Edith Evans, both on stage and <ref target="/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest_(1952_film)" title="The Importance of Being Earnest (1952 film)">in the 1952 film</ref>, delivered the line loudly in a mixture of horror, incredulity and condescension.<ref target="#cite_note-99">[90]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Stockard_Channing" title="Stockard Channing">Stockard Channing</ref>, in the <ref target="/wiki/Gaiety_Theatre,_Dublin" title="Gaiety Theatre, Dublin">Gaiety Theatre, Dublin</ref> in 2010, hushed the line, in a critic's words, "with a barely audible 'A handbag?', rapidly swallowed up with a sharp intake of breath. An understated take, to be sure, but with such a well-known play, packed full of witticisms and aphorisms with a life of their own, it's the little things that make a difference."<ref target="#cite_note-100">[91]</ref></p>

<h3>Characterisation[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest&action=edit&section=18" title="Edit section: Characterisation">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Though Wilde deployed characters that were by now familiar—the dandy lord, the overbearing matriarch, the woman with a past, the puritan young lady—his treatment is subtler than in his earlier comedies. Lady Bracknell, for instance, embodies respectable, upper-class society, but Eltis notes how her development "from the familiar overbearing duchess into a quirkier and more disturbing character" can be traced through Wilde's revisions of the play.<ref target="#cite_note-Eltis177-10">[9]</ref> For the two young men, Wilde presents not stereotypical stage "dudes" but intelligent beings who, as Jackson puts it, "speak like their creator in well-formed complete sentences and rarely use slang or vogue-words".<ref target="#cite_note-jxxix-101">[92]</ref> Dr Chasuble and Miss Prism are characterised by a few light touches of detail, their old-fashioned enthusiasms, and the Canon's fastidious pedantry, pared down by Wilde during his many redrafts of the text.<ref target="#cite_note-jxxix-101">[92]</ref></p>

<h3>Structure and genre[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest&action=edit&section=19" title="Edit section: Structure and genre">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Ransome argues that Wilde freed himself by abandoning the melodrama, the basic structure which underlies his earlier social comedies, and basing the story entirely on the Earnest/Ernest verbal conceit. Freed from "living up to any drama more serious than conversation" Wilde could now amuse himself to a fuller extent with quips, bons mots, epigrams and repartee that really had little to do with the business at hand.<ref target="#cite_note-102">[93]</ref></p>
<p>The genre of the Importance of Being Earnest has been deeply debated by scholars and critics alike who have placed the play within a wide variety of genres ranging from parody to satire. In his critique of Wilde, Foster argues that the play creates a world where "real values are inverted [and], reason and unreason are interchanged".<ref target="#cite_note-103">[94]</ref> Similarly, Wilde's use of dialogue mocks the upper classes of Victorian England lending the play a satirical tone.<ref target="#cite_note-104">[95]</ref> Reinhart further stipulates that the use of farcical humour to mock the upper classes "merits the play both as satire and as drama".<ref target="#cite_note-105">[96]</ref></p>

<p>— Dedication of The Importance of Being Earnest<ref target="#cite_note-106">[97]</ref></p>

<p>Wilde's two final comedies, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, were still on stage in London at the time of his prosecution, and they were soon closed as the details of his case became public. After two years in prison with hard labour, Wilde went into exile in Paris, sick and depressed, his reputation destroyed in England. In 1898, when no-one else would, <ref target="/wiki/Leonard_Smithers" title="Leonard Smithers">Leonard Smithers</ref> agreed with Wilde to publish the two final plays. Wilde proved to be a diligent reviser, sending detailed instructions on stage directions, character listings and the presentation of the book, and insisting that a playbill from the first performance be reproduced inside. Ellmann argues that the proofs show a man "very much in command of himself and of the play".<ref target="#cite_note-Ellmann527-107">[98]</ref> Wilde's name did not appear on the cover, it was "By the Author of Lady Windermere's Fan".<ref target="#cite_note-108">[99]</ref> His return to work was brief though, as he refused to write anything else, "I can write, but have lost the joy of writing".<ref target="#cite_note-Ellmann527-107">[98]</ref></p>

<h3>In translation[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest&action=edit&section=22" title="Edit section: In translation">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The Importance of Being Earnest's popularity has meant it has been translated into many languages, though the homophonous pun in the title ("<ref class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ernest#Proper_noun" title="wikt:Ernest">Ernest</ref>", a masculine proper name, and "<ref class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/earnest#Etymology_1" title="wikt:earnest">earnest</ref>", the virtue of steadfastness and seriousness) poses a special <ref target="/wiki/Translation#Fidelity_and_transparency" title="Translation">problem for translators</ref>. The easiest case of a suitable translation of the pun, perpetuating its sense and meaning, may have been its translation into German. Since English and German are <ref target="/wiki/West_Germanic_languages" title="West Germanic languages">closely related languages</ref>, German provides an equivalent adjective ("ernst") and also a matching masculine proper name ("Ernst"). The meaning and tenor of the wordplay are exactly the same. Yet there are many different possible titles in German, mostly concerning sentence structure. The two most common ones are "Bunbury oder ernst / Ernst sein ist alles" and "Bunbury oder wie wichtig es ist, ernst / Ernst zu sein".<ref target="#cite_note-Pablé_2005:301-81">[72]</ref> In a study of Italian translations, Adrian Pablé found thirteen different versions using eight titles. Since wordplay is often unique to the language in question, translators are faced with a choice of either staying faithful to the original—in this case the English adjective and virtue earnest—or creating a similar pun in their own language.<ref target="#cite_note-110">[101]</ref></p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Wilde-1896-Toulouse-Lautrec.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Wilde-1896-Toulouse-Lautrec.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>Wilde, drawn in 1896 by <ref target="/wiki/Henri_de_Toulouse-Lautrec" title="Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec">Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec</ref>
<p>Four main strategies have been used by translators. The first leaves all characters' names unchanged and in their original spelling: thus the name is respected and readers reminded of the original cultural setting, but the liveliness of the pun is lost.<ref target="#cite_note-111">[102]</ref> Eva Malagoli varied this <ref target="/wiki/Translation" title="Translation">source</ref>-oriented approach by using both the English Christian names and the adjective earnest, thus preserving the pun and the English character of the play, but possibly straining an Italian reader.<ref target="#cite_note-Pablé_2005:319-112">[103]</ref> A third group of translators replaced Ernest with a name that also represents a virtue in the target language, favouring transparency for readers in translation over fidelity to the original.<ref target="#cite_note-Pablé_2005:319-112">[103]</ref> For instance, in Italian, these versions variously call the play L'importanza di essere Franco/Severo/Fedele, the given names being respectively the values of honesty, propriety, and loyalty.<ref target="#cite_note-113">[104]</ref> French offers a closer pun: "<ref class="extiw" href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikt:Constant" title="fr:wikt:Constant">Constant</ref>" is both a first name and the quality of steadfastness, so the play is commonly known as De l'importance d'être Constant, though <ref target="/wiki/Jean_Anouilh" title="Jean Anouilh">Jean Anouilh</ref> translated the play under the title: Il est important d'être Aimé ("<ref class="extiw" href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikt:Aim%C3%A9" title="fr:wikt:Aimé">Aimé</ref>" is a name which also means "beloved").<ref target="#cite_note-114">[105]</ref> These translators differ in their attitude to the original English honorific titles, some change them all, or none, but most leave a mix partially as a compensation for the added loss of Englishness. Lastly, one translation gave the name an Italianate touch by rendering it as Ernesto; this work liberally mixed proper nouns from both languages.<ref target="#cite_note-115">[106]</ref></p>
