<p>The Mikado; or, The Town of Titipu is a <ref target="/wiki/Comic_opera" title="Comic opera">comic opera</ref> in two acts, with music by <ref target="/wiki/Arthur_Sullivan" title="Arthur Sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Libretto" title="Libretto">libretto</ref> by <ref target="/wiki/W._S._Gilbert" title="W. S. Gilbert">W. S. Gilbert</ref>, their ninth of fourteen <ref target="/wiki/Gilbert_and_Sullivan" title="Gilbert and Sullivan">operatic collaborations</ref>. It opened on 14 March 1885, in <ref target="/wiki/London" title="London">London</ref>, where it ran at the <ref target="/wiki/Savoy_Theatre" title="Savoy Theatre">Savoy Theatre</ref> for 672 performances, the second-longest run for any work of musical theatre and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that time.<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-2">[n 1]</ref> By the end of 1885, it was estimated that, in Europe and America, at least 150 companies were producing the opera.<ref target="#cite_note-Mencken-3">[2]</ref></p>
<p>The Mikado remains the most frequently performed <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Savoy_Opera" title="Savoy Opera">Savoy Opera</ref>, and is especially popular with amateur and school productions. The work has been translated into numerous languages and is one of the most frequently played musical theatre pieces in history.</p>
<p>Setting the opera in <ref target="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</ref>, an exotic locale far away from Britain, allowed Gilbert to satirise British politics and institutions more freely by disguising them as Japanese. Gilbert used foreign or fictional locales in several operas, including The Mikado, <ref target="/wiki/Princess_Ida" title="Princess Ida">Princess Ida</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/The_Gondoliers" title="The Gondoliers">The Gondoliers</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Utopia,_Limited" title="Utopia, Limited">Utopia, Limited</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/The_Grand_Duke" title="The Grand Duke">The Grand Duke</ref>, to soften the impact of his pointed satire of British institutions.</p>

<ref target="/wiki/Gilbert_and_Sullivan" title="Gilbert and Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</ref>'s opera immediately preceding The Mikado was <ref target="/wiki/Princess_Ida" title="Princess Ida">Princess Ida</ref> (1884), which ran for nine months, a short duration by <ref target="/wiki/Savoy_opera" title="Savoy opera">Savoy opera</ref> standards.<ref target="#cite_note-4">[3]</ref> When ticket sales for Princess Ida showed early signs of flagging, the impresario <ref target="/wiki/Richard_D%27Oyly_Carte" title="Richard D'Oyly Carte">Richard D'Oyly Carte</ref> realised that, for the first time since 1877, no new Gilbert and Sullivan work would be ready when the old one closed. On 22 March 1884, Carte gave Gilbert and Sullivan contractual notice that a new opera would be required within six months.<ref target="#cite_note-5">[4]</ref> Sullivan's close friend, the conductor <ref target="/wiki/Frederic_Clay" title="Frederic Clay">Frederic Clay</ref>, had suffered a serious stroke in December 1883 that effectively ended his career. Reflecting on this, on his own precarious health, and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music, Sullivan replied to Carte that "it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself".<ref target="#cite_note-6">[5]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-7">[6]</ref> Gilbert, who had already started work on a new libretto in which people fall in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge, was surprised to hear of Sullivan's hesitation. He wrote to Sullivan asking him to reconsider, but the composer replied on 2 April 1884 that he had "come to the end of my tether" with the operas:

<p>.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}...I have been continually keeping down the music in order that not one [syllable] should be lost.... I should like to set a story of human interest & probability where the humorous words would come in a humorous (not serious) situation, & where, if the situation were a tender or dramatic one the words would be of similar character.<ref target="#cite_note-8">[7]</ref></p>

<p>Gilbert was much hurt, but Sullivan insisted that he could not set the "lozenge plot." In addition to its "improbability", it was too similar to the plot of their 1877 opera <ref target="/wiki/The_Sorcerer" title="The Sorcerer">The Sorcerer</ref>. Sullivan returned to London, and, as April wore on, Gilbert tried to rewrite his plot, but he could not satisfy Sullivan. The parties were at a stalemate, and Gilbert wrote, "And so ends a musical & literary association of seven years' standing – an association of exceptional reputation – an association unequaled in its monetary results, and hitherto undisturbed by a single jarring or discordant element."<ref target="#cite_note-9">[8]</ref> But by 8 May 1884, Gilbert was ready to back down, writing: "am I to understand that if I construct another plot in which no supernatural element occurs, you will undertake to set it? ... a consistent plot, free from anachronisms, constructed in perfect good faith & to the best of my ability."<ref target="#cite_note-Ainger233-10">[9]</ref> The stalemate was broken, and on 20 May, Gilbert sent Sullivan a sketch of the plot to The Mikado.<ref target="#cite_note-Ainger233-10">[9]</ref> It would take another ten months for The Mikado to reach the stage. A revised version of The Sorcerer coupled with their one-act piece <ref target="/wiki/Trial_by_Jury" title="Trial by Jury">Trial by Jury</ref> (1875) played at the Savoy while Carte and their audiences awaited their next work. Gilbert eventually found a place for his "lozenge plot" in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Mountebanks_(opera)" title="The Mountebanks (opera)">The Mountebanks</ref>, written with <ref target="/wiki/Alfred_Cellier" title="Alfred Cellier">Alfred Cellier</ref> in 1892.</p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Japanese3vil.jpg"></ref> Photo at the <ref target="/wiki/Japanese_Village,_Knightsbridge" title="Japanese Village, Knightsbridge">Japanese village</ref> taken by WS Gilbert<ref target="#cite_note-exhibition-11">[10]</ref>
<p>In 1914 Cellier and Bridgeman first recorded the familiar story of how Gilbert found his inspiration:</p>

<p>Gilbert, having determined to leave his own country alone for a while, sought elsewhere for a subject suitable to his peculiar humour. A trifling accident inspired him with an idea. One day an old Japanese sword that, for years, had been hanging on the wall of his study, fell from its place. This incident directed his attention to Japan. Just at that time a company of Japanese had arrived in England and set up a little village of their own in Knightsbridge.<ref target="#cite_note-12">[11]</ref></p>

<p>The story is an appealing one, but it is largely fictional.<ref target="#cite_note-Jones_1985,_p._22-13">[12]</ref> Gilbert was interviewed twice about his inspiration for The Mikado. In both interviews the sword was mentioned, and in one of them he said it was the inspiration for the opera, though he never said the sword had fallen. What puts the entire story in doubt is Cellier and Bridgeman's error concerning the <ref target="/wiki/Japanese_Village,_Knightsbridge" title="Japanese Village, Knightsbridge">Japanese exhibition in Knightsbridge</ref>:<ref target="#cite_note-exhibition-11">[10]</ref> it did not open until 10 January 1885, almost two months after Gilbert had already completed Act I.<ref target="#cite_note-Jones_1985,_p._22-13">[12]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-14">[13]</ref> Gilbert scholar Brian Jones, in his article "The Sword that Never Fell", notes that "the further removed in time the writer is from the incident, the more graphically it is recalled."<ref target="#cite_note-15">[14]</ref> Leslie Baily, for instance, told it this way in 1952:</p>

<p>A day or so later Gilbert was striding up and down his library in the new house at Harrington Gardens, fuming at the impasse, when a huge Japanese sword decorating the wall fell with a clatter to the floor. Gilbert picked it up. His perambulations stopped. 'It suggested the broad idea,' as he said later. His journalistic mind, always quick to seize on topicalities, turned to a Japanese Exhibition which had recently been opened in the neighbourhood. Gilbert had seen the little Japanese men and women from the Exhibition shuffling in their exotic robes through the streets of Knightsbridge. Now he sat at his writing desk and picked up the quill pen. He began making notes in his plot-book.<ref target="#cite_note-16">[15]</ref></p>

<p>The story was dramatised in more or less this form in the 1999 film <ref target="/wiki/Topsy-Turvy" title="Topsy-Turvy">Topsy-Turvy</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-17">[16]</ref> But although the 1885–87 Japanese exhibition in Knightsbridge had not opened when Gilbert conceived of The Mikado, European trade with Japan had increased in recent decades, and an English <ref target="/wiki/Japonism" title="Japonism">craze for all things Japanese</ref> had built through the 1860s and 1870s. This made the time ripe for an opera set in Japan.<ref target="#cite_note-Jones688-18">[17]</ref> Gilbert told a journalist, "I cannot give you a good reason for our ... piece being laid in Japan. It ... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, and I think that the idea of a chief magistrate, who is ... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public."<ref target="#cite_note-19">[18]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-Tribune-20">[19]</ref></p>
<p>In an 1885 interview with the New York Daily Tribune, Gilbert said that the short stature of <ref target="/wiki/Leonora_Braham" title="Leonora Braham">Leonora Braham</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Jessie_Bond" title="Jessie Bond">Jessie Bond</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Sybil_Grey" title="Sybil Grey">Sybil Grey</ref> "suggested the advisability of grouping them as three Japanese school-girls", the opera's "three little maids". He also recounted that a young Japanese lady, a tea server at the Japanese village, came to rehearsals to coach the three little maids in Japanese dance.<ref target="#cite_note-Tribune-20">[19]</ref> On 12 February 1885, one month before The Mikado opened, the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Illustrated_London_News" title="Illustrated London News">Illustrated London News</ref> wrote about the opening of the Japanese village noting, among other things, that "the graceful, fantastic dancing featured... three little maids!"<ref target="#cite_note-21">[20]</ref> The title character appears only in Act II of the opera. Gilbert related that he and Sullivan had decided to cut the Mikado's only solo song, but that members of the company and others who had witnessed the dress rehearsal "came to us in a body and begged us to restore [it]".<ref target="#cite_note-Tribune-20">[19]</ref></p>

<p>Gentlemen of the fictitious Japanese town of Titipu are gathered ("If you want to know who we are"). A handsome but poor minstrel, Nanki-Poo, arrives and introduces himself ("A wand'ring minstrel I"). He inquires about his beloved, a schoolgirl called Yum-Yum, who is a ward of Ko-Ko (formerly a cheap tailor). One of the gentlemen, Pish-Tush, explains that when the Mikado decreed that flirting was a capital crime, the Titipu authorities frustrated the decree by appointing Ko-Ko, a prisoner condemned to death for flirting, to the post of Lord High Executioner ("Our great Mikado, virtuous man"). As Ko-Ko was the next prisoner scheduled to be decapitated, the town authorities reasoned that he could "not cut off another's head until he cut his own off", and since Ko-Ko was not likely to try to execute himself, no executions could take place. However, all of the town's officials except the haughty nobleman, Pooh-Bah, proved too proud to serve under an ex-tailor, and they resigned. Pooh-Bah now holds all their posts and collects all their salaries. Pooh-Bah informs Nanki-Poo that Yum-Yum is scheduled to marry Ko-Ko on the very day that he has returned ("Young man, despair").</p>

<p>Ko-Ko enters ("Behold the Lord High Executioner") and asserts himself by reading off a list of people "who would not be missed" if they were executed ("As some day it may happen"), such as people "who eat peppermint and puff it in your face". Yum-Yum appears with Ko-Ko's other two wards, Peep-Bo and Pitti-Sing ("Comes a train of little ladies", "Three little maids from school"). Pooh-Bah does not think that the girls have shown him enough respect ("So please you, sir"). Nanki-Poo arrives and informs Ko-Ko of his love for Yum-Yum. Ko-Ko sends him away, but Nanki-Poo manages to meet with his beloved and reveals his secret to Yum-Yum: he is the son and heir of the Mikado, but travels in disguise to avoid the amorous advances of Katisha, an elderly lady of his father's court. They lament that the law forbids them to flirt ("Were you not to Ko-Ko plighted").</p>
<p>Ko-Ko and Pooh-Bah receive news that the Mikado has just decreed that unless an execution is carried out in Titipu within a month, the town will be reduced to the rank of a village, which would bring "irretrievable ruin". Pooh-Bah and Pish-Tush point to Ko-Ko himself as the obvious choice for beheading, since he was already under sentence of death ("I am so proud"). Ko-Ko argues, however, that, firstly, it would be "extremely difficult, not to say dangerous", for someone to attempt their own beheading, and secondly, it would be suicide, which is a capital offence. Fortuitously, Ko-Ko discovers that Nanki-Poo, in despair over losing Yum-Yum, is preparing to commit suicide. After ascertaining that nothing would change Nanki-Poo's mind, Ko-Ko makes a bargain with him: Nanki-Poo may marry Yum-Yum for one month if, at the end of that time, he allows himself to be executed. Ko-Ko would then marry the young widow.</p>
<p>Everyone arrives to celebrate Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum's union ("With aspect stern and gloomy stride"), but the festivities are interrupted by the arrival of Katisha, who has come to claim Nanki-Poo as her husband. However, the townspeople are sympathetic to the young couple, and Katisha's attempts to reveal Nanki-Poo's secret are drowned out by the shouting of the crowd. Outwitted but not defeated, Katisha makes it clear that she intends to get vengeance.</p>

<h3>Act II[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mikado&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Act II">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Ko-Ko's Garden.</p>
<p>Yum-Yum is being prepared by her friends for her wedding ("Braid the raven hair"), after which she muses on her own beauty ("The sun whose rays"). Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo return to remind her of the limited duration of her impending union. Joined by Nanki-Poo and Pish-Tush, they try to keep their spirits up ("Brightly dawns our wedding-day"), but soon Ko-Ko and Pooh-Bah enter to inform them of a twist in the law that states that when a married man is beheaded for flirting, his wife must be buried alive ("Here's a how-de-do"). Yum-Yum is unwilling to marry under these circumstances, and so Nanki-Poo challenges Ko-Ko to behead him on the spot. It turns out, however, that the soft-hearted Ko-Ko has never executed anyone and cannot execute Nanki-Poo. Ko-Ko instead sends Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum away to be wed (by Pooh-Bah, as Archbishop of Titipu), promising to present to the Mikado a false <ref target="/wiki/Affidavit" title="Affidavit">affidavit</ref> in evidence of the fictitious execution.</p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:BabMikadoTeeth.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:BabMikadoTeeth.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>"His teeth, I've enacted, Shall all be extracted By terrified amateurs." (Cartoon by W. S. Gilbert)
<p>The Mikado and Katisha arrive in Titipu accompanied by a large procession ("Mi-ya Sa-Ma", "From Every Kind of Man"). The Mikado describes his system of justice ("A more humane Mikado"). Ko-Ko assumes that the ruler has come to see whether an execution has been carried out. Aided by Pitti-Sing and Pooh-Bah, he graphically describes the supposed execution ("The criminal cried") and hands the Mikado the certificate of death, signed and sworn to by Pooh-Bah as coroner. Ko-Ko notes slyly that most of the town's important officers (that is, Pooh-Bah) were present at the ceremony. However, the Mikado has come about an entirely different matter; he is searching for his son. When they hear that the Mikado's son "goes by the name of Nanki-Poo", the three panic, and Ko-Ko says that Nanki-Poo "has gone abroad". Meanwhile, Katisha is reading the death certificate and notes with horror that the person executed was Nanki-Poo. The Mikado, though expressing understanding and sympathy ("See How the Fates"), discusses with Katisha the statutory punishment "for compassing the death of the heir apparent" to the Imperial throne – something lingering, "with boiling oil ... or melted lead". With the three conspirators facing painful execution, Ko-Ko pleads with Nanki-Poo to reveal himself to his father. Nanki-Poo fears that Katisha will demand his execution if she finds he is alive, but he suggests that if Katisha could be persuaded to marry Ko-Ko, then Nanki-Poo could safely "come to life again", as Katisha would have no claim on him ("The flowers that bloom in the spring"). Though Katisha is "something appalling", Ko-Ko has no choice: it is marriage to Katisha, or a painful death for himself, Pitti-Sing and Pooh-Bah.</p>
<p>Ko-Ko finds Katisha mourning her loss ("Alone, and yet alive") and throws himself on her mercy. He begs for her hand in marriage, saying that he has long harboured a passion for her. Katisha initially rebuffs him, but is soon moved by his story of a bird who died of heartbreak ("Tit-willow"). She agrees ("There is beauty in the bellow of the blast") and, once the ceremony is performed (by Pooh-Bah, the Registrar), she begs for the Mikado's mercy for him and his accomplices. Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum then reappear, sparking Katisha's fury. The Mikado is astonished that Nanki-Poo is alive, as the account of his execution had been given with such "affecting particulars". Ko-Ko explains that when a royal command for an execution is given, the victim is, legally speaking, as good as dead, "and if he is dead, why not say so?"<ref target="#cite_note-23">[n 3]</ref> The Mikado deems that "Nothing could possibly be more satisfactory", and everyone in Titipu celebrates ("For he's gone and married Yum-Yum").</p>

<h3>Themes of death[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mikado&action=edit&section=11" title="Edit section: Themes of death">edit</ref>]</h3>
<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:The_Story_of_the_Mikado_-_Frontispiece.png"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:The_Story_of_the_Mikado_-_Frontispiece.png" title="Enlarge"></ref>Ko-Ko reveals that when a man is beheaded, his wife is buried alive: from Gilbert's children's book <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Story_of_the_Mikado" title="The Story of the Mikado">The Story of the Mikado</ref>. Art by <ref target="/wiki/Alice_B._Woodward" title="Alice B. Woodward">Alice B. Woodward</ref>.
<p>The Mikado is a comedy that deals with themes of death and cruelty. This works only because Gilbert treats these themes as trivial, even lighthearted issues. For instance, in Pish-Tush's song "Our great Mikado, virtuous man", he sings: "The youth who winked a roving eye / Or breathed a non-connubial sigh / Was thereupon condemned to die – / He usually objected." The term for this rhetorical technique is <ref target="/wiki/Meiosis_(figure_of_speech)" title="Meiosis (figure of speech)">meiosis</ref>, a drastic understatement of the situation. Other examples of this are when self-decapitation is described as "an extremely difficult, not to say dangerous, thing to attempt", and also as merely "awkward". When a discussion occurs of Nanki-Poo's life being "cut short in a month", the tone remains comic and only mock-melancholy. Burial alive is described as "a stuffy death". Finally, execution by boiling oil or by melted lead is described by the Mikado as a "humorous but lingering" punishment.</p>
<p>Death is treated as a businesslike event in Gilbert's topsy-turvy world. Pooh-Bah calls Ko-Ko, the Lord High Executioner, an "industrious mechanic". Ko-Ko also treats his bloody office as a profession, saying, "I can't consent to embark on a professional operation unless I see my way to a successful result." Of course, joking about death does not originate with The Mikado. The plot conceit that Nanki-Poo may marry Yum-Yum if he agrees to die at the end of the month was used in <ref target="/wiki/A_Wife_for_a_Month" title="A Wife for a Month">A Wife for a Month</ref>, a 17th-century play by <ref target="/wiki/John_Fletcher_(playwright)" title="John Fletcher (playwright)">John Fletcher</ref>. Ko-Ko's final speech affirms that death has been, throughout the opera, a fiction, a matter of words that can be dispelled with a phrase or two: being dead and being "as good as dead" are equated. In a review of the original production of The Mikado, after praising the show generally, the critic noted that the show's humour nevertheless depends on "unsparing exposure of human weaknesses and follies – things grave and even horrible invested with a ridiculous aspect – all the motives prompting our actions traced back to inexhaustible sources of selfishness and cowardice... Decapitation, disembowelment, immersion in boiling oil or molten lead are the eventualities upon which [the characters'] attention (and that of the audience) is kept fixed with gruesome persistence... [Gilbert] has unquestionably succeeded in imbuing society with his own quaint, scornful, inverted philosophy; and has thereby established a solid claim to rank amongst the foremost of those latter-day Englishmen who have exercised a distinct psychical influence upon their contemporaries."<ref target="#cite_note-44">[40]</ref></p>

<h3>Japanese setting[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mikado&action=edit&section=12" title="Edit section: Japanese setting">edit</ref>]</h3>

<p>The opera is named after the <ref target="/wiki/Emperor_of_Japan" title="Emperor of Japan">Emperor of Japan</ref> using the term mikado (御門 or 帝 or みかど), literally meaning "the honourable gate" of the imperial palace, referring metaphorically to its occupant and to the palace itself. The term was commonly used by the English in the 19th century but became obsolete.<ref target="#cite_note-45">[41]</ref> To the extent that the opera portrays Japanese culture, style and government, it is a fictional version of Japan used to provide a picturesque setting and to capitalise on <ref target="/wiki/Japonism" title="Japonism">Japonism</ref> and the British fascination with Japan and the <ref target="/wiki/Far_East" title="Far East">Far East</ref> in the 1880s.<ref target="#cite_note-Jones688-18">[17]</ref> Gilbert wrote, "The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution."<ref target="#cite_note-46">[42]</ref> The Mikado "was never a story about Japan but about the failings of the British government".<ref target="#cite_note-47">[43]</ref></p>
<p>By setting the opera in a foreign land, Gilbert felt able to more sharply criticise British society and institutions.<ref target="#cite_note-Steinberg-48">[44]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/G._K._Chesterton" title="G. K. Chesterton">G. K.

I doubt if there is a single joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese. But all the jokes in the play fit the English. ... About England, Pooh-bah is something more than a satire; he is the truth."<ref target="#cite_note-49">[45]</ref> The opera's setting draws on <ref target="/wiki/Victorian_era" title="Victorian era">Victorian</ref> notions of the far east, gleaned by Gilbert from the glimpses of Japanese fashion and art that immediately followed the beginning of trade between the two island empires, and during rehearsals Gilbert visited the popular <ref target="/wiki/Japanese_Village,_Knightsbridge" title="Japanese Village, Knightsbridge">Japanese exhibition</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/Knightsbridge" title="Knightsbridge">Knightsbridge</ref>, London.<ref target="#cite_note-50">[46]</ref> A critic wrote in 2016: "It has been argued that the theatricality of the show was ... a tribute on the part of Gilbert and Sullivan to the growing British appreciation of the Japanese aesthetic [in the 1880s]."<ref target="#cite_note-51">[47]</ref></p>
<p>Gilbert sought authenticity in the Japanese setting, costumes, movements and gestures of the actors. To that end, he engaged some of the Japanese at the Knightsbridge village to advise on the production and to coach the actors. "The Directors and Native Inhabitants" of the village were thanked in the programme that was distributed on the first night.<ref target="#cite_note-52">[48]</ref> Sullivan inserted into his score, as "Miya sama", a version of a Japanese military march song, called "Ton-yare Bushi", composed in the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Meiji_Era" title="Meiji Era">Meiji Era</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-Miya-26">[22]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-53">[49]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-54">[50]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Giacomo_Puccini" title="Giacomo Puccini">Giacomo Puccini</ref> later incorporated the same song into <ref target="/wiki/Madama_Butterfly" title="Madama Butterfly">Madama Butterfly</ref> as the introduction to Yamadori, ancor le pene. The characters' names in the play are not Japanese names, but rather (in many cases) English <ref target="/wiki/Baby_talk" title="Baby talk">baby-talk</ref> or simply dismissive exclamations. For instance, a pretty young thing is named Pitti-Sing; the beautiful heroine is named Yum-Yum; the pompous officials are Pooh-Bah<ref target="#cite_note-55">[n 5]</ref> and Pish-Tush;<ref target="#cite_note-56">[n 6]</ref> the hero is called Nanki-Poo, baby-talk for "<ref target="/wiki/Handkerchief" title="Handkerchief">handkerchief</ref>".<ref target="#cite_note-57">[51]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-58">[52]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-59">[53]</ref> The <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Headsman" title="Headsman">headsman</ref>'s name, Ko-Ko, is similar to that of the scheming Ko-Ko-Ri-Ko in <ref target="/wiki/Ba-ta-clan" title="Ba-ta-clan">Ba-ta-clan</ref> by <ref target="/wiki/Jacques_Offenbach" title="Jacques Offenbach">Jacques Offenbach</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-60">[54]</ref></p>

<p>The Japanese were ambivalent toward The Mikado for many years. Some Japanese critics saw the depiction of the title character as a disrespectful representation of the revered <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Meiji_Emperor" title="Meiji Emperor">Meiji Emperor</ref>; Japanese theatre was prohibited from depicting the emperor on stage.<ref target="#cite_note-61">[55]</ref> Japanese <ref target="/wiki/Prince_Komatsu_Akihito" title="Prince Komatsu Akihito">Prince Komatsu Akihito</ref>, who saw an 1886 production in London, took no offence.<ref target="#cite_note-62">[56]</ref> When <ref target="/wiki/Prince_Fushimi_Sadanaru" title="Prince Fushimi Sadanaru">Prince Fushimi Sadanaru</ref> made a state visit in 1907, the British government banned performances of The Mikado from London for six weeks,<ref target="#cite_note-63">[n 7]</ref> fearing that the play might offend him – a manoeuvre that backfired when the prince complained that he had hoped to see The Mikado during his stay.<ref target="#cite_note-64">[57]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-65">[58]</ref> A Japanese journalist covering the prince's stay attended a proscribed performance and confessed himself "deeply and pleasingly disappointed." Expecting "real insults" to his country, he had found only "bright music and much fun."<ref target="#cite_note-66">[59]</ref></p>
<p>After <ref target="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</ref>, The Mikado was staged in Japan in a number of private performances. The first public production, given at three performances, was in 1946 in the <ref target="/wiki/Tokyo_Takarazuka_Theater" title="Tokyo Takarazuka Theater">Ernie Pyle Theatre</ref> in Tokyo, conducted by the pianist <ref target="/wiki/Jorge_Bolet" title="Jorge Bolet">Jorge Bolet</ref> for the entertainment of American troops and Japanese audiences. The set and costumes were opulent, and the principal players were American, Canadian, and British, as were the women's chorus, but the male chorus, the female dancing chorus and the orchestra were Japanese.<ref target="#cite_note-67">[60]</ref> General <ref target="/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur" title="Douglas MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</ref> banned a large-scale professional 1947 Tokyo production by an all-Japanese cast,<ref target="#cite_note-68">[61]</ref> but other productions have occurred in Japan. For example, the opera was performed at the Ernie Pyle Theatre in Tokyo in 1970, presented by the Eighth Army Special Service.<ref target="#cite_note-69">[62]</ref></p>
<p>In 2001, the town of <ref target="/wiki/Chichibu,_Saitama" title="Chichibu, Saitama">Chichibu</ref> (秩父), Japan, under the name of "Tokyo Theatre Company", produced an adaptation of The Mikado in Japanese.<ref target="#cite_note-tkyt-70">[63]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-71">[64]</ref> Locals believe that Chichibu was the town Gilbert had in mind when he named his setting "Titipu", but there is no contemporary evidence for this theory.<ref target="#cite_note-72">[65]</ref> Although the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hepburn_system" title="Hepburn system">Hepburn system</ref> of <ref target="/wiki/Transliteration" title="Transliteration">transliteration</ref> (in which the name of the town appears as "Chichibu") is usually found today, it was very common in the 19th century to use the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nihon-shiki" title="Nihon-shiki">Nihon-shiki</ref> system, in which the name 秩父 appears as "Titibu". Thus it is easy to surmise that "Titibu", found in the London press of 1884, became "Titipu" in the opera. Japanese researchers speculate that Gilbert may have heard of Chichibu silk, an important export in the 19th century. The town's Japanese-language adaptation of The Mikado has been revived several times throughout Japan and, in 2006, the Chichibu Mikado was performed at the <ref target="/wiki/International_Gilbert_and_Sullivan_Festival" title="International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival">International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival</ref> in England.<ref target="#cite_note-JpSoc-73">[66]</ref></p>

<h4>Criticism[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mikado&action=edit&section=13" title="Edit section: Criticism">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>Since the 1990s, the opera, and productions of it, have sometimes drawn criticism from the Asian-American community as promoting "simplistic orientalist stereotypes".<ref target="#cite_note-74">[67]</ref> In 2014, after a production in <ref target="/wiki/Seattle" title="Seattle">Seattle</ref>, Washington, drew national attention to such criticism,<ref target="#cite_note-75">[68]</ref> the Gilbert biographer Andrew Crowther wrote that The Mikado "does not portray any of the characters as being 'racially inferior' or indeed fundamentally any different from British people. The point of the opera is to reflect British culture through the lens of an invented 'other', a fantasy Japan that has only the most superficial resemblance to reality."<ref target="#cite_note-CrowtherSensitivity-76">[69]</ref> For example, the starting point for the plot of The Mikado is "an invented 'Japanese' law against flirting, which makes sense only as a reference to the sexual prudishness of British culture".<ref target="#cite_note-CrowtherSensitivity-76">[69]</ref> Crowther noted that production design and other features of traditionally staged productions of the opera often "do look somewhat insensitive, not to say insulting. ... It should [be possible] to avoid such things in the future, with a little sensitivity. ... G&S is about silliness, and fun, and ... mocking the powerful, and accepting the fundamental absurdity of life".<ref target="#cite_note-CrowtherSensitivity-76">[69]</ref> Some commentators dismissed the criticism as political correctness<ref target="#cite_note-77">[70]</ref> but a public discussion of the issue in Seattle a month later drew a large crowd who nearly all agreed that, although works like The Mikado should not be abandoned in their traditional form, there should be "some kind of contextualizing apparatus to show that the producers and performers are at least thinking about the problems in the work".<ref target="#cite_note-78">[71]</ref></p>
<p>In 2015 a planned production by the <ref target="/wiki/New_York_Gilbert_and_Sullivan_Players" title="New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players">New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players</ref> was withdrawn after its publicity materials ignited a similar protest in the Asian-American blogosphere. The company redesigned its Mikado production<ref target="#cite_note-79">[72]</ref> and debuted the new concept in December 2016, receiving a warm review from The New York Times.<ref target="#cite_note-80">[73]</ref> After <ref target="/wiki/Lamplighters_Music_Theatre" title="Lamplighters Music Theatre">Lamplighters Music Theatre</ref> of San Francisco planned a 2016 production, objections by the Asian-American community prompted them to reset the opera in <ref target="/wiki/Duchy_of_Milan" title="Duchy of Milan">Renaissance-era Milan</ref>, eliminating all references to Japan.<ref target="#cite_note-81">[74]</ref> Reviewers felt that the change resolved the issue.<ref target="#cite_note-82">[75]</ref></p>

<h3>Modernised words and phrases[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mikado&action=edit&section=14" title="Edit section: Modernised words and phrases">edit</ref>]</h3>
<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:BarringPooh.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:BarringPooh.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref><ref target="/wiki/Rutland_Barrington" title="Rutland Barrington">Barrington</ref>: "Lord-high everything else"
<p>Modern productions update some of the words and phrases in The Mikado. For example, two songs in the opera use the word "<ref target="/wiki/Nigger" title="Nigger">nigger</ref>". In "As some day it may happen", often called the "list song", Ko-Ko names "the nigger serenader and the others of his race". In the Mikado's song, "A more humane Mikado", the lady who modifies her appearance excessively is to be punished by being "blacked like a nigger with permanent walnut juice".<ref target="#cite_note-Dover41-83">[76]</ref> These references are to white performers in <ref target="/wiki/Blackface" title="Blackface">blackface</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Minstrel_show" title="Minstrel show">minstrel shows</ref>, a popular entertainment in the Victorian era, rather than to dark-skinned people.<ref target="#cite_note-Dover9-84">[77]</ref> Until well into the 20th century, audiences did not consider the word "nigger" offensive.<ref target="#cite_note-Pullum-85">[78]</ref> Audience members objected to the word during the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's 1947 American tour, however, and <ref target="/wiki/Rupert_D%27Oyly_Carte" title="Rupert D'Oyly Carte">Rupert D'Oyly Carte</ref> asked <ref target="/wiki/A._P._Herbert" title="A. P. Herbert">A. P. Herbert</ref> to supply revised wording. These alterations have been incorporated into the opera's libretto and score since then.<ref target="#cite_note-B572-86">[79]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-87">[n 8]</ref></p>
<p>Also included in the little list song are "the lady novelist" (referring to writers of fluffy romantic novels; these had been lampooned earlier by <ref target="/wiki/George_Eliot" title="George Eliot">George Eliot</ref>)<ref target="#cite_note-88">[80]</ref> and "the lady from the provinces who dresses like a guy", where guy refers to the dummy that is part of <ref target="/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Night" title="Guy Fawkes Night">Guy Fawkes Night</ref>, meaning a tasteless woman who dresses like a <ref target="/wiki/Scarecrow" title="Scarecrow">scarecrow</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-89">[81]</ref> In the 1908 revival Gilbert allowed substitutions for "the lady novelist".<ref target="#cite_note-B572-86">[79]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-90">[82]</ref> To avoid distracting the audience with references that have become offensive over time, lyrics are sometimes modified in modern productions.<ref target="#cite_note-91">[83]</ref> Changes are also often made, especially in the little list song, to take advantage of opportunities for topical jokes.<ref target="#cite_note-92">[84]</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Richard_Suart" title="Richard Suart">Richard Suart</ref>, a singer well known in the role of Ko-Ko, published a book containing a history of rewrites of the little list song, including many of his own.<ref target="#cite_note-93">[85]</ref></p>

<h3>Enduring popularity[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mikado&action=edit&section=15" title="Edit section: Enduring popularity">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The Mikado became the most frequently performed <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Savoy_Opera" title="Savoy Opera">Savoy Opera</ref><ref target="#cite_note-94">[86]</ref> and has been translated into numerous languages. It is one of the most frequently played musical theatre pieces in history.<ref target="#cite_note-95">[87]</ref> A feature on <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chicago_Lyric_Opera" title="Chicago Lyric Opera">Chicago Lyric Opera</ref>'s 2010 production noted that the opera "has been in constant production for the past 125 years", citing its "inherent humor and tunefulness".<ref target="#cite_note-Steinberg-48">[44]</ref></p>
<p>The Mikado has been admired by other composers. Dame <ref target="/wiki/Ethel_Smyth" title="Ethel Smyth">Ethel Smyth</ref> wrote of Sullivan, "One day he presented me with a copy of the full score of <ref target="/wiki/The_Golden_Legend_(cantata)" title="The Golden Legend (cantata)">The Golden Legend</ref>, adding: 'I think this is the best thing I've done, don't you?' and when truth compelled me to say that in my opinion The Mikado is his masterpiece, he cried out: 'O you wretch!' But though he laughed, I could see he was disappointed."<ref target="#cite_note-96">[88]</ref></p>

<p>The Mikado was adapted as a children's book by W. S. Gilbert titled The Story of The Mikado, which was Gilbert's last literary work.<ref target="#cite_note-133">[123]</ref> It is a retelling of The Mikado with various changes to simplify language or make it more suitable for children. For example, in the "little list" song, the phrase "society offenders" is changed to "inconvenient people", and the second verse is largely rewritten.</p>

<ref target="#cite_ref-2">^</ref> The longest-running piece of musical theatre was the <ref target="/wiki/Operetta" title="Operetta">operetta</ref> <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Les_Cloches_de_Corneville" title="Les Cloches de Corneville">Les Cloches de Corneville</ref>, which held the title until <ref target="/wiki/Dorothy_(opera)" title="Dorothy (opera)">Dorothy</ref> opened in 1886, which pushed The Mikado down to third place.

<p>^ <ref target="#cite_ref-Pish/Go_22-0">a</ref> <ref target="#cite_ref-Pish/Go_22-1">b</ref> The actor who originally played Pish-Tush proved unable satisfactorily to sing the low notes in the Act Two quartet, "Brightly dawns our wedding day". The Pish-Tush line in this quartet lies lower than the rest of the role and ends on a bottom F. Therefore, an extra bass character, called Go-To, was introduced for this song and the dialogue scene leading into it. The <ref target="/wiki/D%27Oyly_Carte_Opera_Company" title="D'Oyly Carte Opera Company">D'Oyly Carte Opera Company</ref> continued generally to bifurcate the role, but vocal scores generally do not mention it. Other companies, however, have generally eliminated the role of Go-To and restored the material to Pish-Tush, when the role is played by someone with a sufficient vocal range.</p>

<ref target="#cite_ref-23">^</ref> This was a topical British legal joke: In the 1882 court case of <ref class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100609142004/http://www.lawiki.org/lawwiki/Walsh_v_Lonsdale_(1882)" rel="nofollow">Walsh v. Lonsdale</ref>, 21 ChD 9, it was held that, as <ref target="/wiki/Equity_(law)" title="Equity (law)">equity</ref> regards as done those things that ought to have been done, an agreement for a lease is as good as a lease.

<ref target="#cite_ref-25">^</ref> The original version of this number included Pish-Tush. His part in it was first reduced, and then eliminated. However, some vocal scores still include Pish-Tush in this number in his reduced role.

<ref target="#cite_ref-55">^</ref> This character is derived from <ref target="/wiki/James_Planch%C3%A9" title="James Planché">James Planché</ref>'s Baron Factotum, the "Great-Grand-Lord-High-Everything" in The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood (1840). Williams (2010), p. 267

<ref target="#cite_ref-56">^</ref> A character in the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bab_Ballad" title="Bab Ballad">Bab Ballad</ref> "King Borriah Bungalee Boo" (1866) is the haughty "Pish-Tush-Pooh-Bah", which is split into two in The Mikado – the terms <ref class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pish" title="wikt:pish">pish</ref>, <ref class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tush" title="wikt:tush">tush</ref>, <ref class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pooh" title="wikt:pooh">pooh</ref>, and <ref class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bah" title="wikt:bah">bah</ref> are all expressions of contempt.

<ref target="#cite_ref-63">^</ref> The ban forced <ref target="/wiki/Helen_Carte" title="Helen Carte">Helen Carte</ref> to drop the always-profitable show from her Gilbert and Sullivan repertory season. See Wilson and Lloyd, p. 83

<ref target="#cite_ref-87">^</ref> In Ko-ko's song the nigger serenader became "the <ref target="/wiki/Banjo" title="Banjo">banjo</ref> serenader" (Dover, p. 9; and Green, p. 416) and the Mikado's punishment for the lady was to be "painted with vigour" (Bradley (1996) p. 623; and Green p. 435).

<ref target="#cite_ref-99">^</ref> The production later moved to the Standard Theatre.

<ref target="#cite_ref-124">^</ref> The first <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phonosc%C3%A8nes" title="Phonoscènes">phonoscènes</ref> in the UK were presented at <ref target="/wiki/Buckingham_Palace" title="Buckingham Palace">Buckingham Palace</ref> in 1907 and included Tit-Willow, sung by George Thorne.

<ref target="#cite_ref-154">^</ref> Another such example is <ref target="/wiki/Rab_Butler" title="Rab Butler">R. A. Butler's</ref> biography, in which there is a chapter called "The Pooh-Bah Years," when Butler held multiple cabinet portfolios.

<ref target="#cite_ref-34">^</ref> Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte had tried various techniques for gaining an American copyright that would prevent unauthorised productions. In the case of Princess Ida and The Mikado, they hired an American, George Lowell Tracy, to create the piano arrangement of the score, hoping that he would obtain rights that he could assign to them. The U.S. courts held, however, that the act of publication made the opera freely available for production by anyone. Jacobs, p. 214 and Ainger, pp. 247, 248 and 251
