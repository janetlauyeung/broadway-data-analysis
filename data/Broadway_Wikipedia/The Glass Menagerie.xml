<p>The Glass Menagerie<ref target="#cite_note-GlassMenagerie2011-1">[1]</ref> is a <ref target="/wiki/Memory_play" title="Memory play">memory play</ref> by <ref target="/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" title="Tennessee Williams">Tennessee Williams</ref> that premiered in 1944 and catapulted Williams from obscurity to fame. The play has strong autobiographical elements, featuring characters based on its author, his <ref target="/wiki/Histrionic_personality_disorder" title="Histrionic personality disorder">histrionic</ref> mother, and his mentally fragile sister Laura. In writing the play, Williams drew on an earlier short story, as well as a screenplay he had written under the title of The Gentleman Caller.</p>
<p>The play premiered in Chicago in 1944. After a shaky start it was championed by Chicago critics <ref target="/wiki/Ashton_Stevens" title="Ashton Stevens">Ashton Stevens</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Claudia_Cassidy" title="Claudia Cassidy">Claudia Cassidy</ref>, whose enthusiasm helped build audiences so the producers could move the play to Broadway where it won the <ref target="/wiki/New_York_Drama_Critics%27_Circle" title="New York Drama Critics' Circle">New York Drama Critics' Circle Award</ref> in 1945. The Glass Menagerie was Williams' first successful play; he went on to become one of America's most highly regarded playwrights.</p>

<h2>Characters[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Glass_Menagerie&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Amanda Wingfield</p>

<p>A faded <ref target="/wiki/Southern_belle" title="Southern belle">Southern belle</ref>, abandoned by her husband, who is trying to raise her two children under harsh financial conditions. Amanda yearns for the comforts of her youth and also longs for her children to have the same comforts, but her devotion to them has made her—as she admits at one point—almost "hateful" towards them.</p>

<p>Tom Wingfield</p>

<p>Amanda's son. Tom works at a shoe warehouse to support his family but is frustrated by his job and aspires to be a poet. He struggles to write, all the while being sleep-deprived and irritable. Yet, he escapes from reality through nightly excursions to the movies. Tom feels both obligated toward yet burdened by his family and longs to escape.</p>

<p>Laura Wingfield</p>

<p>Amanda's daughter and Tom's elder sister. A childhood illness has left her with a limp, and she has a mental fragility and an inferiority complex that has isolated her from the outside world. She has created a world of her own symbolized by her collection of glass figurines. The unicorn may represent Laura because it is unique and fragile.</p>

<p>Jim O'Connor</p>

<p>An old high school acquaintance of Tom and Laura. Jim was a popular athlete and actor during his days at <ref target="/wiki/Soldan_International_Studies_High_School" title="Soldan International Studies High School">Soldan High School</ref>. Subsequent years have been less kind to Jim; however, and by the time of the play's action, he is working as a shipping clerk at the same shoe warehouse as Tom. His hope to shine again is conveyed by his study of public speaking and ideas of self-improvement that appear related to those of <ref target="/wiki/Dale_Carnegie" title="Dale Carnegie">Dale Carnegie</ref>.</p>

<p>Mr. Wingfield</p>

<p>Amanda's absent husband, and Laura's and Tom's father. Mr. Wingfield was a handsome man, full of charm, who worked for a telephone company and eventually "fell in love with long-distance," abandoning his family 16 years before the play's action. Although he does not appear onstage, Mr. Wingfield is frequently referred to by Amanda, and his picture is prominently displayed in the Wingfields' living room. This <ref target="/wiki/Unseen_character" title="Unseen character">unseen character</ref> appears to incorporate elements of Williams' father.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have tricks in my pocket, I have things up my sleeve. But I am the opposite of a stage magician. He gives you an illusion that has the appearance of truth. I give you truth in the pleasant disguise of illusion."</p>
<p>The beginning of Tom's opening soliloquy.</p>


<p>The play is introduced to the audience by Tom, the narrator and protagonist, as a memory play based on his recollection of his mother Amanda and his sister Laura. Because the play is based on memory, Tom cautions the audience that what they see may not be precisely what happened.</p>
<p>Amanda Wingfield, a faded Southern belle of middle age, shares a dingy St. Louis apartment with her son Tom, in his early twenties, and his slightly older sister, Laura. Although she is a survivor and a pragmatist, Amanda yearns for the comforts and admiration she remembers from her days as a fêted debutante. She worries especially about the future of her daughter Laura, a young woman with a limp (an after-effect of a bout of polio) and a tremulous insecurity about the outside world. Tom works in a shoe warehouse doing his best to support the family. He chafes under the banality and boredom of everyday life and struggles to write while spending much of his spare time going to the movies — or so he says — at all hours of the night.</p>
<p>Amanda is obsessed with finding a suitor (or, as she puts it, a "gentleman caller") for Laura, her daughter, whose crippling shyness has led her to drop out of both high school and a subsequent secretarial course, and who spends much of her time polishing and arranging her collection of little glass animals. Pressured by his mother to help find a caller for Laura, Tom invites Jim, an acquaintance from work, home for dinner.</p>
<p>The delighted Amanda spruces up the apartment, prepares a special dinner, and converses coquettishly with Jim, almost reliving her youth when she had an abundance of suitors calling on her. Laura discovers that Jim is the boy she was attracted to in high school and has often thought of since, though the relationship between the shy Laura and the "most likely to succeed" Jim was never more than a distant, teasing acquaintanceship. Initially, Laura is so overcome by shyness that she is unable to join the others at dinner, and she claims to be ill. After dinner, however, Jim and Laura are left alone by candlelight in the living room, waiting for the electricity to be restored. (Tom has not paid the power bill, which hints to the audience that he is banking the bill money and preparing to leave the household.) As the evening progresses, Jim recognizes Laura's feelings of inferiority and encourages her to think better of herself. He and Laura share a quiet dance, in which he accidentally brushes against her glass menagerie, knocking a glass unicorn to the floor and breaking off its horn. Jim then compliments Laura and kisses her. After Jim tells Laura that he is engaged to be married, Laura asks him to take the broken unicorn as a gift and he then leaves. When Amanda learns that Jim is to be married, she turns her anger upon Tom and cruelly lashes out at him, although Tom did not know that Jim was engaged. Tom seems quite surprised by this, and it is possible that Jim was only making up the story of the engagement as he felt that the family was trying to set him up with Laura, and he had no romantic interest in her.</p>
<p>The play concludes with Tom saying that he left home soon afterward and never returned. He then bids farewell to his mother and sister and asks Laura to blow out the candles.</p>

<p>The Glass Menagerie opened on <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref> in the <ref target="/wiki/Playhouse_Theatre_(New_York_City)" title="Playhouse Theatre (New York City)">Playhouse Theatre</ref> on March 31, 1945, and played there until June 29, 1946. It then moved to the <ref target="/wiki/Bernard_B._Jacobs_Theatre" title="Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre">Royale Theatre</ref> from July 1, 1946, until its closing on August 3, 1946. The show was directed by <ref target="/wiki/Eddie_Dowling" title="Eddie Dowling">Eddie Dowling</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Margo_Jones" title="Margo Jones">Margo Jones</ref>. The cast for opening night was as follows:</p>

<ref target="/wiki/Eddie_Dowling" title="Eddie Dowling">Eddie Dowling</ref> as Tom Wingfield
<ref target="/wiki/Laurette_Taylor" title="Laurette Taylor">Laurette Taylor</ref> as Amanda Wingfield
<ref target="/wiki/Julie_Haydon" title="Julie Haydon">Julie Haydon</ref> as Laura Wingfield
<ref target="/wiki/Anthony_Ross" title="Anthony Ross">Anthony Ross</ref> as Jim O'Connor
<p>Laurette Taylor's performance as Amanda set a standard against which subsequent actresses taking the role was to be judged, typically to their disadvantage. In the 2004 documentary <ref target="/wiki/Broadway:_The_Golden_Age,_by_the_Legends_Who_Were_There" title="Broadway: The Golden Age, by the Legends Who Were There">Broadway: The Golden Age, by the Legends Who Were There</ref>, Broadway veterans rank Taylor's performance as the most memorable of their lives.</p>
<p>The play won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award as Best American Play.<ref target="#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> Williams gave credit to two Chicago critics, Claudia Cassidy and Ashton Stevens, for "giving him a 'start...in a fashion'..." Cassidy wrote that the play had "the stamina of success ..." Stevens wrote that the play had "the courage of true poetry ..."<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref></p>

<h2>Autobiographical elements[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Glass_Menagerie&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Autobiographical elements">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The characters and story mimic Williams' own life more closely than any of his other works. Williams (whose real name was Thomas) closely resembles Tom; his mother, Amanda. His sickly and mentally unstable older sister Rose provides the basis for the fragile Laura (whose nickname in the play is "Blue Roses", a result of a bout of <ref target="/wiki/Pleurisy" title="Pleurisy">pleurosis</ref> as a high school student), though it has also been suggested that Laura may incorporate aspects of Williams himself, referencing his introverted nature and obsessive focus on just one aspect of life (writing for Williams and glass animals in Laura's case).<ref target="#cite_note-Leverich1997-4">[4]</ref> Williams, who was close to Rose growing up, learned to his horror that in 1943 in his absence his sister had been subjected to a botched lobotomy. Rose was left incapacitated (and institutionalized) for the rest of her life. With the success of The Glass Menagerie, Williams was to give half of the royalties from the play to his mother. He later designated half of the royalties from his play <ref target="/wiki/Summer_and_Smoke" title="Summer and Smoke">Summer and Smoke</ref> to provide for Rose's care, arranging for her move from the state hospital to a private sanitarium. Eventually, he was to leave the bulk of his estate to ensure Rose's continuing care.<ref target="#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> Rose died in 1996.</p>

<h2>Development[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Glass_Menagerie&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Development">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The play was reworked from one of Williams' short stories "Portrait of a Girl in Glass" (1943; published 1948).<ref target="#cite_note-CollectedStories1985-6">[6]</ref> The story is also written from narrator Tom Wingfield, and many of his soliloquies from The Glass Menagerie seem lifted straight from this original. Certain elements have been omitted from the play, including the reasons for Laura's fascination with Jim's freckles (linked to a book that she loved and often reread, <ref target="/wiki/Freckles_(novel)" title="Freckles (novel)">Freckles</ref> by <ref target="/wiki/Gene_Stratton-Porter" title="Gene Stratton-Porter">Gene Stratton-Porter</ref>). Generally, the story contains the same plot as the play, with certain sections given more emphasis, and character details edited (for example, in the story, Jim nicknames Tom "Slim", instead of "Shakespeare"<ref target="#cite_note-CollectedStories1985-6">[6]</ref>). Another basis for the play is a screenplay Williams wrote under the title of The Gentleman Caller. Williams had been briefly contracted as a writer to <ref target="/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</ref>, and he apparently envisioned <ref target="/wiki/Ethel_Barrymore" title="Ethel Barrymore">Ethel Barrymore</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Judy_Garland" title="Judy Garland">Judy Garland</ref> for the roles that eventually became Amanda and Laura, although when the play was eventually filmed in 1950, <ref target="/wiki/Gertrude_Lawrence" title="Gertrude Lawrence">Gertrude Lawrence</ref> was cast as Amanda and <ref target="/wiki/Jane_Wyman" title="Jane Wyman">Jane Wyman</ref> as Laura.</p>
<p>In 1944, after several reworkings, while touring on the road, the play arrived at the <ref target="/wiki/Civic_Opera_House_(Chicago)" title="Civic Opera House (Chicago)">Civic Theatre</ref> in Chicago. The producers wanted more changes and were heavily pressuring Williams for a happy ending. The play had not found an audience and production was being considered for closing after the opening night in Chicago. Then the reviews by critics Ashton Stevens in The <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chicago_Herald-American" title="Chicago Herald-American">Chicago Herald-American</ref> and Claudia Cassidy in the <ref target="/wiki/Chicago_Tribune" title="Chicago Tribune">Chicago Tribune</ref> came out. They praised the production, especially the writing and the performance by Laurette Taylor, with Cassidy writing about it several times. These reviews drove Chicago audiences to the Civic Theater and the play became a hit, propelling it to Broadway the next year.<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>

<h2>Adaptations[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Glass_Menagerie&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Adaptations">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Film[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Glass_Menagerie&action=edit&section=7" title="Edit section: Film">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Two <ref target="/wiki/Film_adaptation" title="Film adaptation">Hollywood film versions</ref> of The Glass Menagerie have been produced.</p>
<p>The <ref target="/wiki/The_Glass_Menagerie_(1950_film)" title="The Glass Menagerie (1950 film)">first</ref>, was released in 1950 and directed by <ref target="/wiki/Irving_Rapper" title="Irving Rapper">Irving Rapper</ref>, stars <ref target="/wiki/Gertrude_Lawrence" title="Gertrude Lawrence">Gertrude Lawrence</ref> (Amanda), <ref target="/wiki/Jane_Wyman" title="Jane Wyman">Jane Wyman</ref> (Laura), <ref target="/wiki/Arthur_Kennedy" title="Arthur Kennedy">Arthur Kennedy</ref> (Tom) and <ref target="/wiki/Kirk_Douglas" title="Kirk Douglas">Kirk Douglas</ref> (Jim).<ref target="#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> Williams characterized this version, which had an implied happy ending grafted onto it in the style of American films from that era, as the worst adaptation of his work. <ref target="/wiki/Bosley_Crowther" title="Bosley Crowther">Bosley Crowther</ref> of <ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref> wrote, "As much as we hate to say so, Miss Lawrence's performance does not compare with the tender and radiant creation of the late <ref target="/wiki/Laurette_Taylor" title="Laurette Taylor">Laurette Taylor</ref> on the stage."<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> The film has never been released on home media.</p>
<p>In 1987, a <ref target="/wiki/The_Glass_Menagerie_(1987_film)" title="The Glass Menagerie (1987 film)">second adaptation</ref> was released, directed by <ref target="/wiki/Paul_Newman" title="Paul Newman">Paul Newman</ref> and starring <ref target="/wiki/Joanne_Woodward" title="Joanne Woodward">Joanne Woodward</ref> (Amanda), <ref target="/wiki/Karen_Allen" title="Karen Allen">Karen Allen</ref> (Laura), <ref target="/wiki/John_Malkovich" title="John Malkovich">John Malkovich</ref> (Tom) and <ref target="/wiki/James_Naughton" title="James Naughton">James Naughton</ref> (Jim). If anything, this was even less well-received than the earlier film and sank without much attention. However, The New York Times reviewer noted it "starts stiffly and gets better as it goes along, with the dinner-party sequence its biggest success; in this highly charged situation, Miss Woodward's Amanda indeed seems to flower. But quiet reverence is its prevailing tone, and in the end, that seems thoroughly at odds with anything Williams ever intended."<ref target="#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> Similar to the earlier incarnation, it has yet to receive a physical media release.</p>
<p>In 2004, an <ref target="/wiki/Cinema_of_India" title="Cinema of India">Indian</ref> adaptation of the play, filmed in the <ref target="/wiki/Malayalam_cinema" title="Malayalam cinema">Malayalam</ref> language, was released, titled <ref target="/wiki/Akale" title="Akale">Akale</ref> (At a Distance). Directed by <ref target="/wiki/Shyamaprasad" title="Shyamaprasad">Shyamaprasad</ref>, the story is set in the southern Indian state of Kerala in the 1970s, in an Anglo-Indian/Latin Catholic household. The characters were renamed to fit context (the surname Wingfield was changed to D'Costa, reflecting the part-Portuguese heritage of the family — probably on the absent father's side, since the mother is Anglo-Indian), but the story remains essentially the same. It stars <ref target="/wiki/Prithviraj_Sukumaran" title="Prithviraj Sukumaran">Prithviraj Sukumaran</ref> as Neil D'Costa (Tom Wingfield), Geethu Mohandas as Rosemary D'Costa (Laura Wingfield), Sheela as Margaret D'Costa (Amanda Wingfield) and <ref target="/wiki/Tom_George_Kolath" title="Tom George Kolath">Tom George Kolath</ref> as Freddy Evans (Jim O'Connor). Sheela won the <ref target="/wiki/National_Film_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress" title="National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress">National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress</ref>, and Geethu Mohandas won the Kerala State Film Award for the best actress.</p>
<p>The 2011 Iranian film <ref target="/wiki/Here_Without_Me" title="Here Without Me">Here Without Me</ref> is also an adaptation of the play, in a contemporary Iranian setting.<ref target="#cite_note-11">[11]</ref></p>

<h3>Radio[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Glass_Menagerie&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: Radio">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The first radio adaptation was performed on Theatre Guild on the Air in 1951 starring <ref target="/wiki/Helen_Hayes" title="Helen Hayes">Helen Hayes</ref> as Amanda with <ref target="/wiki/Montgomery_Clift" title="Montgomery Clift">Montgomery Clift</ref> as Tom,<ref target="#cite_note-12">[12]</ref> Kathryn Baird as Laura and <ref target="/wiki/Karl_Malden" title="Karl Malden">Karl Malden</ref> as Jim.</p>
<p>A 1953 adaptation appeared on the radio series Best Plays starring <ref target="/wiki/Evelyn_Varden" title="Evelyn Varden">Evelyn Varden</ref> as Amanda and <ref target="/wiki/Geraldine_Page" title="Geraldine Page">Geraldine Page</ref> as Laura. <ref target="/wiki/Jane_Wyman" title="Jane Wyman">Jane Wyman</ref> recreated her film portrayal of Laura for a 1954 adaptation on <ref target="/wiki/Lux_Radio_Theatre" title="Lux Radio Theatre">Lux Radio Theatre</ref> with <ref target="/wiki/Fay_Bainter" title="Fay Bainter">Fay Bainter</ref> as Amanda and <ref target="/wiki/Frank_Lovejoy" title="Frank Lovejoy">Frank Lovejoy</ref> as Tom and <ref target="/wiki/Tom_Brown_(actor)" title="Tom Brown (actor)">Tom Brown</ref> as Jim. The 1953 version is not known to survive but recordings of the other two are in circulation.</p>
<p>In 1964, <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caedmon_Records" title="Caedmon Records">Caedmon Records</ref> produced an LP version as the initial issue of its theatre series. The production starred <ref target="/wiki/Jessica_Tandy" title="Jessica Tandy">Jessica Tandy</ref> as Amanda, <ref target="/wiki/Montgomery_Clift" title="Montgomery Clift">Montgomery Clift</ref> as Tom, <ref target="/wiki/Julie_Harris_(actress)" title="Julie Harris (actress)">Julie Harris</ref> as Laura and <ref target="/wiki/David_Wayne" title="David Wayne">David Wayne</ref> as the gentleman caller. The recording is now available in the form of an audio app.</p>

<h3>Television[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Glass_Menagerie&action=edit&section=9" title="Edit section: Television">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The first television version, recorded on <ref target="/wiki/Videotape" title="Videotape">videotape</ref> and starring <ref target="/wiki/Shirley_Booth" title="Shirley Booth">Shirley Booth</ref>, was broadcast on December 8, 1966, as part of <ref target="/wiki/CBS_Playhouse" title="CBS Playhouse">CBS Playhouse</ref>. <ref target="/wiki/Barbara_Loden" title="Barbara Loden">Barbara Loden</ref> played Laura, <ref target="/wiki/Hal_Holbrook" title="Hal Holbrook">Hal Holbrook</ref> played Tom and <ref target="/wiki/Pat_Hingle" title="Pat Hingle">Pat Hingle</ref> played the Gentleman Caller.<ref target="#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> Booth was nominated for an Emmy for her performance as Amanda.
