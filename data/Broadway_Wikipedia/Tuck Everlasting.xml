<h2>Plot summary[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Tuck_Everlasting&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Plot summary">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Ten-year-old Winifred "Winnie" Foster is frustrated with her family and considers running away from her home in rural Treegap. One day, while in a wooded area her family owns, she sees a boy of about 17 drinking from a spring. He introduces himself as Jesse Tuck and tells her not to drink the spring water. Soon after, his brother Miles and his mother Mae take her away with them. On the way, they are pursued by a man in a yellow suit, who had approached the Fosters asking questions about their land the day before.</p>
<p>The Tucks explain to Winnie that the spring grants eternal life to anyone who drinks its water, effects which they discovered by accident. In the process, Miles had to cope with his wife leaving him and taking their children. They have been living in seclusion outside of Treegap for years, reuniting every ten years and drinking from the spring. Winnie grows particularly fond of Jesse and his father, Angus Tuck.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the man in the yellow suit has been pursuing the Tucks. Once he discovers they have taken Winifred, he steals their horse and rides it back to the Foster homestead. After he informs her family of Winnie's whereabouts, they dispatch him and the local constable to return her. However, he breaks away and rides ahead of the constable, for he has a selfish motive for finding Winnie.</p>
<p>When the man in the yellow suit arrives at the Tucks' farm, he informs them that he has been searching for them for years. Miles' wife and children had come to live with his family when he was a boy, and he heard rumors of their secret. He then informs the angry family that he told the Fosters where Winnie was and that he has received a bounty in exchange for her safe return: the wooded area and with it the spring. He plans to gather the water from the spring and sell it to the public. When the Tucks refuse his offer to be partners in the venture, he declares he does not need their permission to sell the water and begins to take Winnie away. Mae attacks the man in the yellow suit, fatally fracturing his skull, just as the constable arrives. Mae is arrested, condemned to the gallows and scheduled for execution the next morning.</p>
<p>Angus, Miles, and Jesse realize that their secret will be revealed once Mae is hanged, for she will not be able to die, so they take Winnie with them and break Mae out of jail. Winnie takes her place so the Tucks can escape. Although they are reunited, there is no more reason for them to be in Treegap, as Mae is now a fugitive from justice. Before departing, Jesse gives Winnie a bottle of the special water so she might drink it when she turns 17 and follow them and marry him. She considers this, but decides not to and pours it onto a toad.</p>
<p>Many years later, Mae and Angus Tuck return to Treegap and find that it has changed a great deal – the wooded area is gone and so is their spring; the town has become a typical suburban metropolis. While there, they visit a cemetery where they find Winnie's grave; she went on to marry, and had died two years before in 1948. Though Angus Tuck is saddened by this, he also praises Winnie for choosing not to drink the water. They come across a toad near her grave, unaware that it is the same one that she had poured water on years before.</p>
