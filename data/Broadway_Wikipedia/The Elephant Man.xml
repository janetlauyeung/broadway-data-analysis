<p>Joseph Carey Merrick (5 August 1862 – 11 April 1890), often erroneously called John Merrick, was an English man with severe deformities. He was first exhibited at a <ref target="/wiki/Freak_show" title="Freak show">freak show</ref> as the "Elephant Man", and then went to live at the <ref target="/wiki/Royal_London_Hospital" title="Royal London Hospital">London Hospital</ref> after he met <ref target="/wiki/Sir_Frederick_Treves,_1st_Baronet" title="Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet">Frederick Treves</ref>, subsequently becoming well known in London society.</p>
<p>Merrick was born in <ref target="/wiki/Leicester" title="Leicester">Leicester</ref> and began to develop abnormally during the first few years of his life. His mother died when he was 11<ref target="#cite_note-Vigor-Mungovin61-1">[1]</ref> and his father soon remarried. Rejected by his father and stepmother, he left home and went to live with his uncle Charles Merrick.<ref target="#cite_note-Vigor-Mungovin77-2">[2]</ref> In 1879, 17-year-old Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse.<ref target="#cite_note-Vigor-Mungovin83-3">[3]</ref> In 1884 he contacted a showman named <ref target="/wiki/Sam_Torr" title="Sam Torr">Sam Torr</ref> and proposed that Torr should exhibit him. Torr arranged for a group of men to manage Merrick, whom they named the Elephant Man. </p>
<p>After touring the <ref target="/wiki/East_Midlands" title="East Midlands">East Midlands</ref>, Merrick travelled to London to be exhibited in a <ref target="/wiki/Penny_gaff" title="Penny gaff">penny gaff</ref> shop rented by showman <ref target="/wiki/Tom_Norman" title="Tom Norman">Tom Norman</ref>. Norman's shop was visited by surgeon <ref target="/wiki/Sir_Frederick_Treves,_1st_Baronet" title="Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet">Frederick Treves</ref> who invited Merrick to be examined. After Merrick was displayed by Treves at a meeting of the <ref target="/wiki/Pathological_Society_of_London" title="Pathological Society of London">Pathological Society of London</ref> in 1884, Norman's shop was closed by the police<ref target="#cite_note-Vigor-Mungovin120-4">[4]</ref> and Merrick joined Sam Roper's circus and was toured in Europe.<ref target="#cite_note-Vigor-Mungovin123-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>In <ref target="/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</ref>, Merrick was robbed by his road manager and abandoned in <ref target="/wiki/Brussels" title="Brussels">Brussels</ref>. He eventually made his way back to the London Hospital<ref target="#cite_note-Vigor-Mungovin141-6">[6]</ref> where he was allowed to stay for the rest of his life. Treves visited him daily, and the pair developed quite a close friendship. Merrick also got visits from the wealthy ladies and gentlemen of London society, including <ref target="/wiki/Alexandra_of_Denmark" title="Alexandra of Denmark">Alexandra, Princess of Wales</ref>. Although the official cause of his death was <ref target="/wiki/Asphyxia" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</ref>, Treves, who performed the autopsy on the body, said that Merrick had died of a dislocated neck.</p>
<p>The exact cause of Merrick's deformities is unclear. In 1986 it was conjectured that he had <ref target="/wiki/Proteus_syndrome" title="Proteus syndrome">Proteus syndrome</ref>. DNA tests on his hair and bones in a 2003 study were inconclusive.</p>

<p>Joseph Carey Merrick was born 5 August 1862 at 50 Lee Street in <ref target="/wiki/Leicester" title="Leicester">Leicester</ref>, to Joseph Rockley Merrick and his wife Mary Jane (née Potterton).<ref target="#cite_note-odnb-7">[7]</ref> Joseph Rockley Merrick (c. 1838–1897) was the son of London-born weaver Barnabas Merrick (1791–1856) who moved to Leicester during the 1820s or 1830s, and his third wife Sarah Rockley.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell33-8">[8]</ref> Mary Jane Potterton (c. 1837–1873) had been born at <ref target="/wiki/Evington" title="Evington">Evington</ref>, Leicestershire, her father being William Potterton, who was described as an agricultural labourer in the 1851 census of Thurmaston, Leicestershire.<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> She was said to have some form of physical disability and as a young woman worked as a domestic servant in Leicester before marrying Joseph Rockley Merrick, then a warehouseman,<ref target="#cite_note-Vigor-Mungovin38-10">[10]</ref> in 1861.</p>
<p>The following year, Joseph Carey Merrick was born, apparently healthy, and had no outward symptoms of any disorder for the first few years of his life. Named after his father, he was given the middle name Carey by his mother, a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Baptist" title="Baptist">Baptist</ref>, after the preacher <ref target="/wiki/William_Carey_(missionary)" title="William Carey (missionary)">William Carey</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell42-11">[11]</ref> The Merricks had two more children, not three as stated on his mother's grave. John Thomas, born 21 April 1864, who died of <ref target="/wiki/Smallpox" title="Smallpox">smallpox</ref> on 24 July of the same year, was not related to Joseph and Mary Jane Merrick.<ref target="#cite_note-Vigor-Mungovin59-12">[12]</ref></p>
<p>The other two children were: William Arthur, born January 1866, who died of <ref target="/wiki/Scarlet_fever" title="Scarlet fever">scarlet fever</ref> on 21 December 1870 aged four and was buried on Christmas Day 1870; and Marian Eliza, born 28 September 1867, who was born with physical disabilities and died of <ref target="/wiki/Myelitis" title="Myelitis">myelitis</ref> and "seizures" on 19 March 1891, aged 24. William is buried with his mother, aunts and uncles in Welford Road Cemetery in Leicester<ref target="#cite_note-Vigor-Mungovin58-13">[13]</ref> while Marian is buried with her father in Belgrave Cemetery in Leicester.<ref target="#cite_note-Vigor-Mungovin79-14">[14]</ref> In his book The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity, <ref target="/wiki/Ashley_Montagu" title="Ashley Montagu">Ashley Montagu</ref> states that "John Thomas [<ref target="/wiki/Sic" title="Sic">sic</ref>] Merrick was born on 21 April 1864".<ref target="#cite_note-Montagu39-15">[15]</ref> Montagu believed Treves's statement in his book, The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences, referring to Merrick's first name as John, not Joseph, was due to confusing him with his supposed younger brother, who was later discovered to be of no relation to Joseph Merrick.<ref target="#cite_note-Vigor-Mungovin59-12">[12]</ref></p>
<p>A pamphlet titled "The <ref target="/wiki/Autobiography" title="Autobiography">Autobiography</ref> of Joseph Carey Merrick", produced c. 1884 to accompany his exhibition, states that he started to display symptoms at approximately five years of age, with "thick lumpy skin ... like that of an elephant, and almost the same colour".<ref target="#cite_note-pamphlet-16">[16]</ref> According to a 1930 article in the Illustrated Leicester Chronicle, he began to develop swellings on his lips at the age of 21 months, followed by a bony lump on his forehead and a loosening and roughening of the skin.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell43-17">[17]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-19">[nb 1]</ref> As he grew, a noticeable difference between the size of his left and right arms appeared and both his feet became significantly enlarged.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell43-17">[17]</ref> The Merrick family explained his symptoms as the result of Mary's being knocked over and frightened by a fairground elephant while she was pregnant with Joseph.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell43-17">[17]</ref> The concept of <ref target="/wiki/Maternal_impression" title="Maternal impression">maternal impression</ref>—that the emotional experiences of pregnant women could have lasting physical effect on their unborn children—was still common in 19th-century Britain.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell129-20">[19]</ref> Merrick held this belief about the cause of his affliction for his entire life.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell128-21">[20]</ref></p>
<p>In addition to his deformities, at some point during his childhood, Merrick suffered a fall and damaged his left hip. This injury became infected and left him permanently lame.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell44-22">[21]</ref> Although affected by his physical deformities, Merrick attended school and enjoyed a close relationship with his mother.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell44-22">[21]</ref> She was a <ref target="/wiki/Sunday_school" title="Sunday school">Sunday school</ref> teacher, and his father worked as an <ref target="/wiki/Railroad_engineer" title="Railroad engineer">engine driver</ref> at a cotton factory, as well as running a <ref target="/wiki/Haberdasher" title="Haberdasher">haberdashery</ref> business.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell44-22">[21]</ref> On 29 May 1873, fewer than three years after the death of her youngest son William, Mary Jane Merrick died from <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bronchopneumonia" title="Bronchopneumonia">bronchopneumonia</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-Vigor-Mungovin61-1">[1]</ref> Joseph Rockley Merrick moved with his two children to live with Mrs. Emma Wood Antill, a widow with children of her own. They married on 3 December 1874.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell47-23">[22]</ref></p>

<p>"I was taunted and sneered at so that I would not go home to my meals, and used to stay in the streets with a hungry belly rather than return for anything to eat, what few half-meals I did have, I was taunted with the remark—'That's more than you have earned.'"</p>
<p>— "The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick"<ref target="#cite_note-pamphlet-16">[16]</ref></p>


<p>Merrick left school aged 13, which was usual for the time.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell48-24">[23]</ref> His home-life was now "a perfect misery",<ref target="#cite_note-pamphlet-16">[16]</ref> and neither his father nor his stepmother demonstrated affection towards him.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell47-23">[22]</ref> He ran away "two or three" times, but was brought back by his father each time.<ref target="#cite_note-pamphlet-16">[16]</ref> At 13, he found work rolling cigars in a factory, but after three years, his right hand deformity had worsened and he no longer had the dexterity required for the job.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell48-24">[23]</ref> Now unemployed, he spent his days wandering the streets, looking for work and avoiding his stepmother's taunts.<ref target="#cite_note-odnb-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>Merrick was becoming a greater financial burden on his family, and eventually his father secured him a <ref target="/wiki/Peddler" title="Peddler">hawker</ref>'s licence which enabled him to earn money selling items from the haberdashery shop, door to door.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell49-25">[24]</ref> This endeavour was unsuccessful, since Merrick's facial deformities rendered his speech increasingly unintelligible and prospective customers reacted with horror to his physical appearance. Housewives refused to open doors for him and now people not only stared at him but began to follow him out of curiosity.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell49-25">[24]</ref> Merrick failed to make enough money as a hawker to support himself. On returning home one day in 1877, he was severely beaten by his father and he left home for good.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell50-26">[25]</ref></p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:ElephantMan2.JPG"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:ElephantMan2.JPG" title="Enlarge"></ref>Merrick photographed in 1888
<p>Merrick was now homeless on the streets of Leicester. His uncle, a barber named Charles Merrick, heard of his nephew's situation, sought him out and offered him accommodation in his home.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell51-27">[26]</ref> Merrick continued to hawk around Leicester for the next two years but his efforts to earn a living met with little more success than before. Eventually, his disfigurement drew such negative attention from members of the public that the Commissioners for <ref target="/wiki/Hackney_carriage#History" title="Hackney carriage">Hackney Carriages</ref> withdrew his licence when it came up for renewal.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell51-27">[26]</ref> With young children to provide for, Charles could no longer afford to support his nephew. In late December 1879, now 17 years old, Merrick entered the Leicester Union <ref target="/wiki/Workhouse" title="Workhouse">Workhouse</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell52-28">[27]</ref></p>
<p>Merrick became one of 1,180 residents in the workhouse.<ref target="#cite_note-Vigor-Mungovin88-29">[28]</ref> Joseph was given a classification to determine his place of accommodation. The class system determined which department or ward he would reside as well as the amounts of food he would receive. Joseph was classed as class one for able bodied males and females.<ref target="#cite_note-Vigor-Mungovin88-29">[28]</ref> On 22 March 1880, only 12 weeks after entering, Merrick signed himself out of the workhouse and spent two days looking for work. With no more success than before, he found himself with no option but to return to the workhouse. This time he stayed for four years.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell57-30">[29]</ref></p>
<p>Around 1882, Merrick underwent surgery on his face. The protrusion from his mouth had grown to 8–9 inches and severely inhibited his speech and made it difficult to eat.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell58-31">[30]</ref> He was operated on in the Workhouse Infirmary under the direction of Dr Clement Frederick Bryan and had a large part of the mass removed.<ref target="#cite_note-Vigor-Mungovin96-32">[31]</ref></p>

<h2>Life as a curiosity[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Merrick&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Life as a curiosity">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Merrick concluded that his only escape from the workhouse might be through the world of human novelty exhibitions.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell62-33">[32]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-HumanMarvel-34">[33]</ref> He knew of a Leicester <ref target="/wiki/Music_hall" title="Music hall">music hall</ref> comedian and proprietor named <ref target="/wiki/Sam_Torr" title="Sam Torr">Sam Torr</ref>. Merrick wrote to Torr, who came and visited him at the workhouse. Torr decided that he could make money exhibiting Merrick; although, to retain Merrick's novelty, he would have to be a travelling exhibit.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell62-33">[32]</ref> To this end, he organised a group of managers for Merrick: music hall proprietor J. Ellis, travelling showman George Hitchcock, and fair owner Sam Roper. On 3 August 1884, Merrick departed the workhouse to start his new career.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell63-35">[34]</ref></p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Merrick-shop.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Merrick-shop.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>The shop on <ref target="/wiki/Whitechapel_Road" title="Whitechapel Road">Whitechapel Road</ref> where Merrick was exhibited. Today it sells <ref target="/wiki/Sari" title="Sari">saris</ref>.
<p>The showmen named Merrick the Elephant Man, and advertised him as "Half-a-Man and Half-an-Elephant".<ref target="#cite_note-Howell63-35">[34]</ref> They showed him around the <ref target="/wiki/East_Midlands" title="East Midlands">East Midlands</ref>, including in Leicester and <ref target="/wiki/Nottingham" title="Nottingham">Nottingham</ref>, before moving him on to London for the winter season. George Hitchcock contacted an acquaintance, showman <ref target="/wiki/Tom_Norman" title="Tom Norman">Tom Norman</ref>, who ran <ref target="/wiki/Penny_gaff" title="Penny gaff">penny gaff</ref> shops in <ref target="/wiki/East_End_of_London" title="East End of London">London's East End</ref> exhibiting human curiosities. Without a meeting, Norman agreed to take over Merrick's management and in November, Hitchcock travelled with Merrick to London.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell64-36">[35]</ref></p>
<p>When Tom Norman first saw Merrick, he was dismayed by the extent of his deformities, fearing his appearance might be too horrific to be a successful novelty.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell72-37">[36]</ref> Nevertheless, he exhibited Merrick in the back of an empty shop on <ref target="/wiki/Whitechapel_Road" title="Whitechapel Road">Whitechapel Road</ref>. Merrick had an iron bed with a curtain drawn around to afford him some privacy. Norman observed Merrick asleep one morning and learnt that he always slept sitting up, with his legs drawn up and his head resting on his knees. His enlarged head was too heavy to allow him to sleep lying down and, as Merrick put it, he would risk "waking with a broken neck".<ref target="#cite_note-Howell75-38">[37]</ref> Norman decorated the shop with posters that had been created by Hitchcock, depicting a monstrous half-man, half-elephant.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell73-39">[38]</ref> A pamphlet titled "The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick" was created, outlining Merrick's life to date. This biography, whether written by Merrick or not, provided a generally accurate account of his life. It contained an incorrect date of birth but, throughout his life, Merrick was vague about when he was born.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell53-40">[39]</ref></p>


<p>Ladies and gentlemen ... I would like to introduce Mr Joseph Merrick, the Elephant Man. Before doing so I ask you please to prepare yourselves—Brace yourselves up to witness one who is probably the most remarkable human being ever to draw the breath of life.</p>
<p>—<ref target="/wiki/Tom_Norman" title="Tom Norman">Tom Norman</ref><ref target="#cite_note-Howell74-41">[40]</ref></p>

<p>Norman gathered an audience by standing outside the shop and drawing a crowd through his showman <ref target="/wiki/Patter" title="Patter">patter</ref>. He would then lead his onlookers into the shop, explaining that the Elephant Man was "not here to frighten you but to enlighten you".<ref target="#cite_note-Howell73-39">[38]</ref> Drawing aside the curtain, he allowed the onlookers—often visibly horrified—to observe Merrick up close, while describing the circumstances leading to his present condition, including his mother's alleged accident with an elephant.</p>
<p>The Elephant Man exhibit was moderately successful, and made money primarily from the sales of the autobiographical pamphlet.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell75-38">[37]</ref> Merrick was able to put his share of the profits aside, hoping to earn enough to one day buy a home of his own.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell78-42">[41]</ref> The shop on Whitechapel Road was directly across the road from the <ref target="/wiki/Royal_London_Hospital" title="Royal London Hospital">London Hospital</ref>, an excellent location, as medical students and doctors visited the shop, curious to see Merrick.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell75-38">[37]</ref> One visitor was a young <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pre-registration_house_officer_(UK)" title="Pre-registration house officer (UK)">house surgeon</ref> named Reginald Tuckett.

<p>Frederick Treves first met Merrick that November at a private viewing, before Norman opened the shop for the day.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell75-38">[37]</ref> Treves later recalled in his 1923 Reminiscences that Merrick was "the most disgusting specimen of humanity that I had ever seen ... at no time had I met with such a degraded or perverted version of a human being as this lone figure displayed."<ref target="#cite_note-Treves-44">[43]</ref> The viewing lasted no more than 15 minutes after which Treves returned to work. Later that day, he sent Tuckett back to the shop to ask if Merrick might be willing to come to the hospital for an examination. Norman and Merrick agreed.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell76-45">[44]</ref> To enable him to travel the short distance without drawing undue attention, Merrick wore a costume consisting of an oversized black cloak and a brown cap with a hessian sack that covered his face, and rode in a cab hired by Treves.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell13-46">[45]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-48">[nb 2]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-HumanMarvel-34">[33]</ref></p>
<p>At the hospital, Treves examined Merrick, observing that he was "shy, confused, not a little frightened, and evidently much cowed".<ref target="#cite_note-Treves-44">[43]</ref> At this point, Treves assumed that the Elephant Man was an "<ref target="/wiki/Imbecile" title="Imbecile">imbecile</ref>".<ref target="#cite_note-Treves-44">[43]</ref> He measured Merrick's head circumference at the large size of 36 inches (91 cm), his right wrist at 12 inches (30 cm) and one of his fingers at 5 inches (13 cm) in circumference. He noted that his skin was covered in <ref target="/wiki/Papilloma" title="Papilloma">papillomata</ref> (<ref target="/wiki/Wart" title="Wart">warty</ref> growths), the largest of which exuded an unpleasant smell.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell23-49">[47]</ref> The <ref target="/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue" title="Subcutaneous tissue">subcutaneous tissue</ref> appeared to be weakened and caused a loosening of the skin, which in some areas hung away from the body. There were bone deformities in the right arm, both legs, and, most conspicuously, in the large skull.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell24-50">[48]</ref> Despite the corrective surgery to his mouth in 1882, Merrick's speech remained barely intelligible. His left arm and hand were not large and were not deformed. His penis and scrotum were normal. Apart from his deformities and the lameness in his hip, Treves concluded that Merrick appeared to be in good general health.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell25-51">[49]</ref></p>
<p>Norman later recalled that Merrick went to the hospital for examination "two or three" times<ref target="#cite_note-Howell76-45">[44]</ref> and during one of their meetings, Treves gave Merrick his <ref target="/wiki/Visiting_card" title="Visiting card">calling card</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-odnb-7">[7]</ref> On one of the visits, Treves had photographs taken, and he provided Merrick with a set of copies which were later added to his autobiographical pamphlet.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell79-52">[50]</ref> On December 2, Treves presented Merrick at a meeting of the <ref target="/wiki/Pathological_Society_of_London" title="Pathological Society of London">Pathological Society of London</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/Bloomsbury" title="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell26-53">[51]</ref> Eventually, Merrick told Norman that he no longer wanted to be examined at the hospital. According to Norman, he said he was "stripped naked and felt like an animal in a cattle market".<ref target="#cite_note-Howell77-54">[52]</ref></p>
<p>During this time in Victorian Britain, tastes were changing in regard to freak show exhibitions like the Elephant Man. Shows like Norman's were a cause for public concern, both on the grounds of decency and due to the disruption caused by crowds gathering outside them.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell29-55">[53]</ref> Not long after Merrick's last examination with Frederick Treves, the police closed down Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road, and Merrick's Leicester managers withdrew him from Norman's care.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell77-54">[52]</ref> In 1885, Merrick went on the road with Sam Roper's travelling fair.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell80-56">[54]</ref> He befriended two other performers, "Roper's Midgets"—Bertram Dooley and Harry Bramley—who on occasion defended Merrick from public harassment.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell81-47">[46]</ref></p>

<h2>Europe[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Merrick&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Europe">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The dampening of public enthusiasm for freak shows and human oddities continued and the police and magistrates became increasingly vigilant in closing down shows. Merrick remained a horrifying spectacle for his viewers and Roper grew nervous about the negative attention the Elephant Man drew from local authorities.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell81-47">[46]</ref> Merrick's group of managers decided that he should go on tour in <ref target="/wiki/Continental_Europe" title="Continental Europe">Continental Europe</ref>, with the hope that authorities there would be more lenient. Merrick's management was assumed by an unknown man (possibly named Ferrari) and they left for the continent.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell84-57">[55]</ref> The Elephant Man was no more successful there than in Britain, and similar action was taken by authorities to move him out of their jurisdictions. In Brussels, Merrick was deserted by this new manager, who stole Merrick's £50 (2018 equivalent £5,400) savings.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell85-58">[56]</ref> Abandoned, Merrick made his way by train to <ref target="/wiki/Ostend" title="Ostend">Ostend</ref>, where he attempted to board a ferry for <ref target="/wiki/Dover" title="Dover">Dover</ref> but was refused passage.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell86-59">[57]</ref> He travelled to <ref target="/wiki/Antwerp" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</ref> and was able to board a ship bound for <ref target="/wiki/Harwich" title="Harwich">Harwich</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/Essex" title="Essex">Essex</ref>. From there, he travelled by train to London and arrived at <ref target="/wiki/Liverpool_Street_station" title="Liverpool Street station">Liverpool Street station</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell87-60">[58]</ref></p>
<p>Merrick arrived at Liverpool Street Station on 24 June 1886, safely back in his own country, but with nowhere to go. He was not eligible to enter a workhouse in London for more than one night and would be accepted only by Leicester Union, where he was a permanent resident. Leicester was 98 miles (158 km) away.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell88-61">[59]</ref> He approached strangers for help, but his speech was unintelligible and his appearance repugnant. He drew a crowd of curious onlookers until a policeman helped him into an empty waiting room, where he huddled in a corner, exhausted. Unable to make himself understood, his only identifying possession was Frederick Treves's card.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell89-62">[60]</ref> The police contacted Treves, who went to the station. Recognising Merrick, Treves took him in a <ref target="/wiki/Hansom_cab" title="Hansom cab">hansom cab</ref> to the London Hospital. Merrick was admitted for <ref target="/wiki/Bronchitis" title="Bronchitis">bronchitis</ref>, washed, fed and put to bed in a small isolation room in the hospital's attic.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell90-63">[61]</ref></p>

<h2>London Hospital[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Merrick&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: London Hospital">edit</ref>]</h2>

<p>With Merrick admitted into the hospital, Treves now had time to conduct a more thorough examination. He discovered that Merrick's physical condition had deteriorated over the previous two years and that he had become quite crippled by his deformities. Treves also suspected that Merrick now suffered from a heart condition and that he had only a few years left to live.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell94-64">[62]</ref> Merrick's general health improved over the next five months under the care of the hospital staff. Although some nurses were initially upset by his appearance, they overcame this and cared for him.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell95-65">[63]</ref></p>
<p>The problem of his unpleasant odour was mitigated through frequent bathing and Treves gradually developed an understanding of Merrick's speech. A new set of photographs was taken. The question of Merrick's long-term care had to be addressed. Francis Carr Gomm, the chairman of the hospital committee, had supported Treves in his decision to admit Merrick, but by November, long-term plans needed to be made. The London Hospital was not equipped or staffed to provide care for the incurable, which Merrick clearly was.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell95-65">[63]</ref></p>
<p>Carr Gomm contacted other institutions and hospitals more suited to caring for chronic cases, but none would accept Merrick. Gomm wrote a letter to <ref target="/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The Times</ref>, printed on 4 December, outlining Merrick's case and asking readers for suggestions.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell93-66">[64]</ref> The public response—in letters and donations—was significant, and the situation was even covered by the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_Medical_Journal" title="British Medical Journal">British Medical Journal</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-BMJDec86-67">[65]</ref> With the financial backing of the many donors, Gomm was able to make a convincing case to the committee for keeping Merrick in the hospital. It was decided that he would be allowed to stay there for the remainder of his life.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell99-68">[66]</ref> He was moved from the attic to two rooms in the basement adjacent to a small courtyard. The rooms were adapted and furnished to suit Merrick, with a specially constructed bed and—at Treves's instruction—no mirrors.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell100-69">[67]</ref></p>
<p>Merrick settled into his new life at the London Hospital. Treves visited him daily and spent a couple of hours with him every Sunday.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell102-70">[68]</ref> Now that Merrick had found someone who understood his speech, he was delighted to carry on long conversations with the doctor.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell102-70">[68]</ref> Treves and Merrick built a friendly relationship, although Merrick never completely confided in him. He told Treves that he was an only child, and Treves had the impression that Merrick's mother, whose picture Merrick always carried with him, had abandoned him as a baby.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell102-70">[68]</ref> Merrick was also reluctant to talk about his exhibition days, although he expressed gratitude towards his former managers.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell103-71">[69]</ref> It did not take Treves long to realise that, contrary to his initial impressions, Merrick was not intellectually impaired.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell102-70">[68]</ref></p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Merrick-letter.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Merrick-letter.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>The only surviving letter written by Merrick
<p>Treves observed that Merrick was very sensitive and showed his emotions easily.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell104-72">[70]</ref> At times Merrick was bored and lonely, and demonstrated signs of <ref target="/wiki/Depression_(mood)" title="Depression (mood)">depression</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell106-73">[71]</ref> He had spent his entire adult life segregated from women, first in the workhouse and then as an exhibit. The women he met were either disgusted or frightened by his appearance.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell105-74">[72]</ref> His opinions about women were derived from his memories of his mother and what he read in books. Treves decided that Merrick would like to be introduced to a woman and it would help him feel normal.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell107-75">[73]</ref> The doctor arranged for a friend of his named Mrs. Leila Maturin, "a young and pretty widow", to visit Merrick.<ref target="#cite_note-Treves-44">[43]</ref> She agreed and with fair warning about his appearance, she went to his rooms for an introduction. The meeting was short, as Merrick quickly became overcome with emotion.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell107-75">[73]</ref> He later told Treves that Maturin had been the first woman ever to smile at him, and the first to shake his hand.<ref target="#cite_note-Treves-44">[43]</ref> She kept in contact with him and a letter written by Merrick to her, thanking her for the gift of a book and a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2_(number)#In_other_fields" title="2 (number)">brace</ref> of <ref target="/wiki/Grouse" title="Grouse">grouse</ref> (a pair of birds), is the only surviving letter written by Merrick.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell145-76">[74]</ref> This first experience of meeting a woman, though brief, instilled in Merrick a new sense of self-confidence.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell108-77">[75]</ref> He met other women during his life at the hospital, and appeared taken with them all. Treves believed that Merrick's hope was to go to live at an institution for the blind, where he might meet a woman who could not see his deformities.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell108-77">[75]</ref></p>
<p>Merrick wanted to know about the "real world", and questioned Treves on a number of topics. One day he expressed a desire to see inside what he considered a "real" house and Treves obliged, taking him to visit his <ref target="/wiki/Wimpole_Street" title="Wimpole Street">Wimpole Street</ref> townhouse and meet his wife.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell114-78">[76]</ref> At the hospital Merrick filled his days with reading and constructing models of buildings out of card. He entertained visits from Treves and his house surgeons. He rose each day in the afternoon and would leave his rooms to walk in the small adjacent courtyard, after dark.</p>

<p>As a result of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case attracted the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress <ref target="/wiki/Madge_Kendal" title="Madge Kendal">Madge Kendal</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell109-79">[77]</ref> Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell111-80">[78]</ref> She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver to go to his rooms and teach him the craft.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell112-81">[79]</ref> Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell113-82">[80]</ref> A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell111-80">[78]</ref> Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell113-82">[80]</ref></p>
<p>On 21 May 1887, two new buildings were completed at the hospital and the <ref target="/wiki/Edward_VII" title="Edward VII">Prince</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Alexandra_of_Denmark" title="Alexandra of Denmark">Princess of Wales</ref> came to open them officially.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell115-83">[81]</ref> Princess Alexandra wished to meet the Elephant Man, so after a tour of the hospital, the royal party went to his rooms for an introduction. The princess shook Merrick's hand and sat with him, an experience that left him overjoyed.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell116-84">[82]</ref> She gave him a signed photograph of herself, which became a prized possession, and she sent him a <ref target="/wiki/Christmas_card" title="Christmas card">Christmas card</ref> each year.<ref target="#cite_note-Treves-44">[43]</ref></p>
<p>On at least one occasion, Merrick was able to fulfil a long-held desire to visit the theatre.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell119-85">[83]</ref> Treves, with the help of Madge Kendal, arranged for him to attend the Christmas <ref target="/wiki/Pantomime" title="Pantomime">pantomime</ref> at the <ref target="/wiki/Theatre_Royal,_Drury_Lane" title="Theatre Royal, Drury Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</ref>. Treves sat with some nurses, concealed in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Baroness_Burdett-Coutts" title="Baroness Burdett-Coutts">Baroness Burdett-Coutts</ref>' private box.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell120-86">[84]</ref> According to Treves, Merrick was "awed" and "enthralled". "The spectacle left him speechless, so that if he were spoken to he took no heed".<ref target="#cite_note-Treves-44">[43]</ref> For weeks following the show Merrick talked about the pantomime, reliving the story as if it had been real.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell126-87">[85]</ref></p>

<p>On three occasions Merrick left the hospital and London on holiday, spending a few weeks at a time in the countryside.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell142-88">[86]</ref> Through elaborate arrangements that allowed Merrick to board a train unseen and have an entire carriage to himself, he travelled to <ref target="/wiki/Northamptonshire" title="Northamptonshire">Northamptonshire</ref> to stay at <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fawsley_Hall" title="Fawsley Hall">Fawsley Hall</ref>, the estate of Lady <ref target="/wiki/Rainald_Knightley,_1st_Baron_Knightley" title="Rainald Knightley, 1st Baron Knightley">Knightley</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell142-88">[86]</ref> He stayed at the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gamekeeper" title="Gamekeeper">gamekeeper</ref>'s cottage and spent the days walking in the estate's woods, collecting wild flowers.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell143-89">[87]</ref> He befriended a young farm labourer who later recalled Merrick as an interesting and well-educated man.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell145-76">[74]</ref> Treves called this "the one supreme holiday of [Merrick's] life", although in fact there were three such trips.<ref target="#cite_note-Treves-44">[43]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-Howell144-90">[88]</ref></p>
<p>Merrick's condition gradually deteriorated during his four years at the London Hospital. He required a great deal of care from the nursing staff and spent much of his time in bed, or sitting in his quarters, with diminishing energy.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell145-76">[74]</ref> His facial deformities continued to grow and his head became even more enlarged. He died on 11 April 1890, at the age of 27.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell146-91">[89]</ref> At around 3:00 p.m. Treves's house surgeon visited Merrick and found him lying dead across his bed. His body was formally identified by his uncle, Charles Merrick.<ref target="#cite_note-timesobit-92">[90]</ref> An <ref target="/wiki/Inquest" title="Inquest">inquest</ref> was held on 15 April by <ref target="/wiki/Wynne_Edwin_Baxter" title="Wynne Edwin Baxter">Wynne Edwin Baxter</ref>, who had come to notoriety conducting inquests for the <ref target="/wiki/Whitechapel_murders" title="Whitechapel murders">Whitechapel murders</ref> of 1888.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell146-91">[89]</ref></p>


<p>He often said to me that he wished he could lie down to sleep 'like other people' ... he must, with some determination, have made the experiment ... Thus it came about that his death was due to the desire that had dominated his life—the pathetic but hopeless desire to be 'like other people'.</p>

<p>Merrick's death was ruled accidental and the certified cause of death was <ref target="/wiki/Asphyxia" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</ref>, caused by the weight of his head as he lay down.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell147-93">[91]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-Howell151-94">[92]</ref> Treves, who performed an autopsy on the body, said that Merrick had died of a dislocated neck.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell151-94">[92]</ref> Knowing that Merrick had always slept sitting upright out of necessity, Treves came to the conclusion that Merrick must have "made the experiment", attempting to sleep lying down "like other people".<ref target="#cite_note-Treves-44">[43]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-Howell151-94">[92]</ref></p>
<p>Treves dissected Merrick's body and took plaster casts of his head and limbs. He took skin samples, which were later lost during the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</ref>, and mounted his skeleton, which remains in the pathology collection at the <ref target="/wiki/Royal_London_Hospital" title="Royal London Hospital">Royal London Hospital</ref>,<ref target="#cite_note-Graham23-95">[93]</ref> which amalgamated in 1995 with St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College, under the aegis of <ref target="/wiki/Queen_Mary_University_of_London" title="Queen Mary University of London">Queen Mary University of London</ref>, a constituent college of the federal University of London and a member of the United Hospitals.<ref target="#cite_note-UniLon-96">[94]</ref> His mounted skeleton at the medical school is not on public display.<ref target="#cite_note-97">[95]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-98">[96]</ref></p>
<p>There is a small museum dedicated to his life, housing some of his personal effects, and a new replica of his skeleton went on display in 2012. His remains in a glass case in a private room at the university can be viewed by medical students and professionals by appointment, to "allow medical students to view and understand the physical deformities resulting from Joseph Merrick's condition". Although the Queen Mary University of London intends to keep his skeleton at its medical school, some are contending that as a devout Christian Merrick should be given a Christian burial in his home city of Leicester.<ref target="#cite_note-99">[97]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-100">[98]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-101">[99]</ref></p>

<p>Ever since Joseph Merrick's days as a novelty exhibit on Whitechapel Road, his condition has been a source of curiosity for medical professionals.<ref target="#cite_note-103">[101]</ref> His appearance at the meeting of the Pathological Society of London in 1884 drew interest from the doctors present, but none of the answers nor the attention that Treves had hoped for. The case received only a brief mention in the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_Medical_Journal" title="British Medical Journal">British Medical Journal</ref>, and the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lancet_(journal)" title="Lancet (journal)">Lancet</ref> declined to mention it at all.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell27-104">[102]</ref> Four months later, in 1885, Treves brought the case before the meeting for a second time. By then, Tom Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road had been closed, and the Elephant Man had moved on. Without Merrick, Treves made do with the photographs he had taken during his examinations. </p>
<p>One of the doctors present at the meeting was <ref target="/wiki/Henry_Radcliffe_Crocker" title="Henry Radcliffe Crocker">Henry Radcliffe Crocker</ref>, a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dermatologist" title="Dermatologist">dermatologist</ref> who was an authority on skin diseases.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell28-105">[103]</ref> After hearing Treves's description of Merrick, and viewing the photographs, Crocker proposed that Merrick's condition might be a combination of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pachydermatocele" title="Pachydermatocele">pachydermatocele</ref> and an unnamed bone deformity, all caused by changes in the nervous system.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell29-55">[53]</ref> Crocker wrote about Merrick's case in his 1888 book Diseases of the Skin: their Description, Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell127-106">[104]</ref></p>
<p>In 1909, dermatologist <ref target="/wiki/Frederick_Parkes_Weber" title="Frederick Parkes Weber">Frederick Parkes Weber</ref> wrote an article about von Recklinghausen disease in the <ref target="/wiki/British_Journal_of_Dermatology" title="British Journal of Dermatology">British Journal of Dermatology</ref>,<ref target="#cite_note-Howell133-107">[105]</ref> erroneously citing Merrick as an example of the disease, which German pathologist <ref target="/wiki/Friedrich_Daniel_von_Recklinghausen" title="Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen">Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen</ref> had described in 1882,<ref target="#cite_note-Howell132-108">[106]</ref> but recently it has been found that this conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin,<ref target="#cite_note-Howell134-109">[107]</ref> and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called <ref target="/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_au_lait_spot" title="Café au lait spot">café au lait spots</ref>;<ref target="#cite_note-Korf-110">[108]</ref> however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell137-111">[109]</ref> For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnoses were advanced, such as <ref target="/wiki/Maffucci_syndrome" title="Maffucci syndrome">Maffucci syndrome</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Polyostotic_fibrous_dysplasia" title="Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia">polyostotic fibrous dysplasia</ref> (Albright's disease).<ref target="#cite_note-Howell137-111">[109]</ref></p>
<p>In a 1986 article in the British Medical Journal, <ref target="/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(doctor)" title="Michael Cohen (doctor)">Michael Cohen</ref> and J.A.R.

<p>In a letter to Biologist in June 2001, British teacher and <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chartered_Biologist" title="Chartered Biologist">Chartered Biologist</ref> Paul Spiring<ref target="#cite_note-114">[112]</ref> speculated that Merrick might have suffered from a combination of Proteus syndrome and <ref target="/wiki/Neurofibromatosis" title="Neurofibromatosis">neurofibromatosis</ref>. This hypothesis was reported by <ref target="/wiki/Robert_Matthews_(scientist)" title="Robert Matthews (scientist)">Robert Matthews</ref>, a correspondent for <ref target="/wiki/The_Sunday_Telegraph" title="The Sunday Telegraph">The Sunday Telegraph</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-Matthews-115">[113]</ref> The possibility that Merrick had both conditions formed the basis for a 2003 documentary film entitled The Curse of The Elephant Man that was produced for the <ref target="/wiki/Discovery_Health_Channel" title="Discovery Health Channel">Discovery Health Channel</ref> by <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Natural_History_New_Zealand" title="Natural History New Zealand">Natural History New Zealand</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-BBCunravelled-116">[114]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-telegraph-117">[115]</ref></p>
<p>During 2002, genealogical research for the film led to a <ref target="/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</ref> appeal to trace Merrick's maternal family line. In response to the appeal, a Leicester resident named Pat Selby was discovered to be the granddaughter of Merrick's uncle George Potterton. A research team took <ref target="/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</ref> samples from Selby in an unsuccessful attempt to diagnose Merrick's condition.<ref target="#cite_note-BBCSelby-118">[116]</ref> During 2003, the filmmakers commissioned further diagnostic tests using DNA that was extracted from Merrick's hair and bone. However, the results of these tests proved inconclusive; therefore, the precise cause of Merrick's medical condition remains uncertain.<ref target="#cite_note-BBCunravelled-116">[114]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-telegraph-117">[115]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-119">[117]</ref></p>

<h2>Legacy[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Merrick&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: Legacy">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>In 1923, Frederick Treves published a volume, The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences, in which he detailed what he knew of Merrick's life and their personal interactions. This account is the source of much of what is known about Merrick, but there were several inaccuracies in the book. Merrick never completely confided in Treves about his early life, so these details were consequently sketchy in Treves's Reminiscences. A more mysterious error is that of Merrick's first name. Treves, in his earlier journal articles as well as his book, insisted on calling him John Merrick. The reason for this is unclear; Merrick clearly signed his name as "Joseph" in the examples of his handwriting that remain.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell7-120">[118]</ref> In the handwritten manuscript for The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences, Treves began his account by writing "Joseph" and then crossed it out and replaced it with "John".<ref target="#cite_note-Howell164-121">[119]</ref> Whatever the reason for the error, it is one that persisted throughout much of the 20th century; later biographers who based their work on Treves's book have continued the error.</p>
<p>Treves's depiction of <ref target="/wiki/Tom_Norman" title="Tom Norman">Tom Norman</ref>, the showman who had exhibited Merrick, was that of a cruel drunk who had ruthlessly exploited his charge.<ref target="#cite_note-odnbnorman-122">[120]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-shef-123">[121]</ref> In a letter to the World's Fair newspaper, and later in his own memoirs, Norman denied this characterisation and said that he provided his show attractions with a way of earning a living, and that at the London Hospital, Merrick was still on display, but with no control over how or when he was viewed. According to Nadja Durbach, author of The Spectacle of Deformity: Freak Shows and Modern British Culture, Norman's view gives an insight into the Victorian freak show's function as a means of survival for poor people with deformities, as well as the attitude of medical professionals of the time.<ref target="#cite_note-Durbach34-124">[122]</ref> Durbach cautions that both Treves's and Norman's memoirs must be understood as "narrative reconstructions ... that reflect personal and professional prejudices and cater to the demands and expectations of their very different audiences".<ref target="#cite_note-Durbach37-125">[123]</ref></p>
<p>In 1971, anthropologist <ref target="/wiki/Ashley_Montagu" title="Ashley Montagu">Ashley Montagu</ref> published The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity which drew on Treves's book and explored Merrick's character.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell171-126">[124]</ref> Montagu reprinted Treves's account alongside various others such as Carr Gomm's letter to the Times and the report on Merrick's inquest. He pointed out inconsistencies between the accounts and sometimes disputed Treves's version of events; he noted, for example, that while Treves claimed Merrick knew nothing of his mother's appearance, Carr Gomm refers to Merrick carrying a painting of his mother with him,<ref target="#cite_note-Montagu41-127">[125]</ref> and he criticised Treves's assumption that Merrick's mother was "worthless and inhuman".<ref target="#cite_note-Montagu41-127">[125]</ref> However, Montagu also perpetuated some of the errors in Treves's work,<ref target="#cite_note-Howell178-128">[126]</ref> including his use of the name "John" rather than "Joseph".<ref target="#cite_note-Montagu41-127">[125]</ref></p>
<p>In 1980, Michael Howell and Peter Ford published <ref target="/wiki/The_True_History_of_the_Elephant_Man" title="The True History of the Elephant Man">The True History of the Elephant Man</ref>, presenting the fruits of their detailed archival research. Howell and Ford brought to light a large amount of new information about Merrick. In addition to proving that his name was Joseph, not John, they were able to describe in more detail his life story. They refuted some of the inaccuracies in Treves's account, showing that Merrick's mother did not abandon him, and that Merrick deliberately chose to exhibit himself to make a living.</p>


<p>'Tis true my form is something odd,</p>
<p>But blaming me is blaming God;</p>
<p>Could I create myself anew</p>
<p>I would not fail in pleasing you.</p>
<p>If I could reach from pole to pole</p>
<p>Or grasp the ocean with a span,</p>
<p>I would be measured by the soul;</p>

<p>The mind's the standard of the man.</p>

<p>Some persons remarked on Merrick's strong Christian faith (Treves is also said to have been a Christian), and his strong character and courage in the face of afflictions earned him admiration.<ref target="#cite_note-129">[127]</ref> Between 1979 and 1982, Merrick's life story became the basis of several works of dramatic art; these were based on the accounts of Treves and Montagu. In 1979, a <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Award" title="Tony Award">Tony Award</ref>–winning play, <ref target="/wiki/The_Elephant_Man_(play)" title="The Elephant Man (play)">The Elephant Man</ref>, by American playwright <ref target="/wiki/Bernard_Pomerance" title="Bernard Pomerance">Bernard Pomerance</ref> was staged.<ref target="#cite_note-DailyNews-130">[128]</ref> The character based on Merrick was initially played by <ref target="/wiki/David_Schofield_(actor)" title="David Schofield (actor)">David Schofield</ref><ref target="#cite_note-131">[129]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-132">[130]</ref> and in subsequent productions by actors including <ref target="/wiki/Philip_Anglim" title="Philip Anglim">Philip Anglim</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/David_Bowie" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Mark_Hamill" title="Mark Hamill">Mark Hamill</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Bradley_Cooper" title="Bradley Cooper">Bradley Cooper</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-Montreal-133">[131]</ref> In 1980, a film <ref target="/wiki/The_Elephant_Man_(film)" title="The Elephant Man (film)">The Elephant Man</ref>, directed by <ref target="/wiki/David_Lynch" title="David Lynch">David Lynch</ref>, was released; it received eight <ref target="/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</ref> nominations.

<p>In November 2016, Joanne Vigor-Mungovin published a book called Joseph: The Life, Times and Places of the Elephant Man, with the foreword written by a member of Joseph Merrick's family.

<p>Notes</p>


<ref target="#cite_ref-19">^</ref> An article was published anonymously in the Illustrated Leicester Chronicle on 27 December 1930 which was, according to Howell & Ford (1992), "clearly based on a knowledge of the Merrick family circumstances". It included information about Merrick's mother's background, his early development and his attempts to gain employment.<ref target="#cite_note-18">[18]</ref>

<ref target="#cite_ref-48">^</ref> Although Treves states that Merrick's outfit on this occasion included the black cloak and brown cap, there is evidence to suggest that Merrick acquired this particular costume a year later, while travelling with Sam Roper's Fair. If that was the case, Treves was remembering the clothing from a later meeting with Merrick.<ref target="#cite_note-Howell81-47">[46]</ref>
