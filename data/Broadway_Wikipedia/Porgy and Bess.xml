<p>Porgy and Bess (<ref target="/wiki/Help:IPA/English" title="Help:IPA/English">/ˈpɔːrɡi/</ref>) is an English-language <ref target="/wiki/Opera" title="Opera">opera</ref> by the American composer <ref target="/wiki/George_Gershwin" title="George Gershwin">George Gershwin</ref>, with a <ref target="/wiki/Libretto" title="Libretto">libretto</ref> written by author <ref target="/wiki/DuBose_Heyward" title="DuBose Heyward">DuBose Heyward</ref> and lyricist <ref target="/wiki/Ira_Gershwin" title="Ira Gershwin">Ira Gershwin</ref>. It was adapted from <ref target="/wiki/Dorothy_Heyward" title="Dorothy Heyward">Dorothy Heyward</ref> and DuBose Heyward's play <ref target="/wiki/Porgy_(play)" title="Porgy (play)">Porgy</ref>, itself an adaptation of DuBose Heyward's <ref target="/wiki/Porgy_(novel)" title="Porgy (novel)">1925 novel</ref> of the same name.</p>
<p>Porgy and Bess was first performed in Boston on September 30, 1935, before it moved to <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref> in New York City.<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref> It featured a cast of classically trained African-American singers—a daring artistic choice at the time. After suffering from an initially unpopular public reception, a 1976 <ref target="/wiki/Porgy_and_Bess#1976_Houston_Grand_Opera_production" title="Porgy and Bess">Houston Grand Opera</ref> production gained it new popularity, and it is now one of the best-known and most frequently performed operas.</p>
<p>Gershwin read Porgy in 1926 and proposed to Heyward to collaborate on an operatic version. In 1934, Gershwin and Heyward began work on the project by visiting the author's native <ref target="/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina" title="Charleston, South Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</ref>. In a 1935 <ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">New York Times</ref> article, Gershwin explained why he called Porgy and Bess a folk opera: </p>

<p>Porgy and Bess is a folk tale. Its people naturally would sing folk music. When I first began work in the music I decided against the use of original folk material because I wanted the music to be all of one piece. Therefore I wrote my own spirituals and folksongs. But they are still folk music – and therefore, being in operatic form, Porgy and Bess becomes a folk opera.<ref target="#cite_note-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>The libretto of Porgy and Bess tells the story of Porgy, a disabled black street-beggar living in the slums of Charleston. It deals with his attempts to rescue Bess from the clutches of Crown, her violent and possessive lover, and Sportin' Life, her drug dealer. The opera plot generally follows the stage play.</p>
<p>In the years following Gershwin's death, Porgy and Bess was adapted for smaller scale performances. It was <ref target="/wiki/Porgy_and_Bess_(film)" title="Porgy and Bess (film)">adapted as a film</ref> in 1959. Some of the songs in the opera, such as "<ref target="/wiki/Summertime_(George_Gershwin_song)" title="Summertime (George Gershwin song)">Summertime</ref>", became popular and frequently recorded songs.</p>
<p>In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the trend has been toward productions with greater fidelity to Gershwin's original intentions. Smaller-scale productions also continue to be mounted. A complete recorded version of the score was released in 1976; since then, it has been recorded several times.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1933 Gershwin and Heyward signed a contract with the Theatre Guild to write the opera. In the summer of 1934 Gershwin and Heyward went to <ref target="/wiki/Folly_Beach,_South_Carolina" title="Folly Beach, South Carolina">Folly Beach, South Carolina</ref> (a small island near Charleston), where Gershwin got a feel for the locale and its music. He worked on the opera there and in New York. Ira Gershwin, in New York, wrote lyrics to some of the opera's classic songs, most notably "It Ain't Necessarily So". Most of the lyrics, including "Summertime", were written by Heyward, who also wrote the libretto.<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref></p>

<p>Gershwin's first version of the opera, running four hours (counting the two intermissions), was performed privately in a concert version in <ref target="/wiki/Carnegie_Hall" title="Carnegie Hall">Carnegie Hall</ref>, in the fall of 1935. He chose as his choral director <ref target="/wiki/Eva_Jessye" title="Eva Jessye">Eva Jessye</ref>, who also directed her own renowned choir.

The run on Broadway lasted 124 performances. The production and direction were entrusted to <ref target="/wiki/Rouben_Mamoulian" title="Rouben Mamoulian">Rouben Mamoulian</ref>, who had previously directed the Broadway productions of Heyward's play Porgy. The music director was <ref target="/wiki/Alexander_Smallens" title="Alexander Smallens">Alexander Smallens</ref>.

At that meeting, he told her, "I want you to know, Miss Brown, that henceforth and forever after, George Gershwin's opera will be known as Porgy and Bess.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>]<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> The influential <ref target="/wiki/Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</ref> artist <ref target="/wiki/John_W._Bubbles" title="John W.

<p>After the Broadway run, a tour started on January 27, 1936, in Philadelphia and traveled to Pittsburgh and Chicago before ending in Washington, D.C., on March 21, 1936.

<p>In 1938, much of the original cast reunited for a <ref target="/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="West Coast of the United States">West Coast</ref> revival that played in <ref target="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</ref> and at the <ref target="/wiki/Curran_Theatre" title="Curran Theatre">Curran Theatre</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</ref>. <ref target="/wiki/Avon_Long" title="Avon Long">Avon Long</ref> took on the role of Sportin' Life for the first time, a role he would continue to play in many productions over a long career.</p>

<h3>1942 Broadway revival[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Porgy_and_Bess&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: 1942 Broadway revival">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The noted director and producer <ref target="/wiki/Cheryl_Crawford" title="Cheryl Crawford">Cheryl Crawford</ref> produced professional stock theater in <ref target="/wiki/Maplewood,_New_Jersey" title="Maplewood, New Jersey">Maplewood, New Jersey</ref>, for three very successful seasons. The last of these closed with Porgy and Bess, which she co-produced with <ref target="/wiki/John_Wildberg" title="John Wildberg">John Wildberg</ref>. In re-fashioning it in the style of <ref target="/wiki/Musical_theatre" title="Musical theatre">musical theatre</ref> which Americans were used to hearing from Gershwin, Crawford produced a drastically cut version of the opera compared with the first Broadway staging. The orchestra was reduced, the cast was halved, and many <ref target="/wiki/Recitative" title="Recitative">recitatives</ref> were reduced to spoken dialog.<ref target="#cite_note-JS-9">[9]</ref></p>
<p>Having seen the performance, theater owner <ref target="/wiki/Lee_Shubert" title="Lee Shubert">Lee Shubert</ref> arranged for Crawford to bring her production to Broadway. The show opened at the <ref target="/wiki/Majestic_Theatre_(Broadway)" title="Majestic Theatre (Broadway)">Majestic Theatre</ref> in January 1942.<ref target="#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> Duncan and Brown reprised their roles as the title characters, with Alexander Smallens again conducting. In June the contralto <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Etta_Moten" title="Etta Moten">Etta Moten</ref>, whom Gershwin had first envisioned as Bess, replaced Brown in the role. Moten was such a success that Bess became her signature role. The Crawford production ran for nine months and was far more successful financially than the original.</p>
<p>Radio station <ref target="/wiki/WOR_(AM)" title="WOR (AM)">WOR</ref> in New York broadcast a live one-hour version on May 7, 1942.

<h3>European premieres[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Porgy_and_Bess&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: European premieres">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>On March 27, 1943, the opera had its European premiere at the <ref target="/wiki/Royal_Danish_Theatre" title="Royal Danish Theatre">Royal Danish Theatre</ref> in Copenhagen. Performed during the <ref target="/wiki/Nazism" title="Nazism">Nazi</ref> occupation of the country, this performance was notable for being performed by an all-white cast made up in <ref target="/wiki/Blackface" title="Blackface">blackface</ref>. After 22 sold-out performances, the Nazis closed the production.<ref target="#cite_note-loc-8">[8]</ref> Other all-white or mostly-white productions in Europe, reflecting contemporary demographics in the countries, took place in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Zurich" title="Zurich">Zurich</ref>, Switzerland, in 1945 and 1950, and <ref target="/wiki/Gothenburg" title="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Stockholm" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</ref>, Sweden, in 1948.</p>

<h3>1952 touring production[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Porgy_and_Bess&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: 1952 touring production">edit</ref>]</h3>
<ref target="/wiki/Blevins_Davis" title="Blevins Davis">Blevins Davis</ref> and Robert Breen produced a revival in 1952 which restored much of the music cut in the Crawford version, including many of the recitatives. It divided the opera into two acts, with the intermission occurring after Crown forces Bess to stay on Kittiwah Island. This version restored the work to a more operatic form, though not all of the recitatives were retained. In this version, Porgy and Bess was warmly received throughout Europe.<ref target="#cite_note-loc-8">[8]</ref> The London premiere took place on October 9, 1952 at the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stoll_Theatre" title="Stoll Theatre">Stoll Theatre</ref>, where the opera continued until February 10, 1953.<ref target="#cite_note-11">[11]</ref>

The role of Clara was played by a young <ref target="/wiki/Maya_Angelou" title="Maya Angelou">Maya Angelou</ref>. Price and Warfield met and wed while on the tour. The role of Porgy was the first for Warfield after his appearance as Joe, singing "<ref target="/wiki/Ol%27_Man_River" title="Ol' Man River">Ol' Man River</ref>" in the popular 1951 <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MGM" title="MGM">MGM</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Show_Boat_(1951_film)" title="Show Boat (1951 film)">film of Show Boat</ref>.</p>
<p>After a tour of Europe financed by the <ref target="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State" title="United States Department of State">United States Department of State</ref>, the production came to Broadway's <ref target="/wiki/Ziegfeld_Theatre_(1927)" title="Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)">Ziegfeld Theatre</ref> in March 1953. It later toured North America. After completing its North American run in Montreal, the company embarked on an international tour, with LeVern Hutcherson as Porgy and <ref target="/wiki/Gloria_Davy" title="Gloria Davy">Gloria Davy</ref> as Bess. The production first performed in Venice, Paris, and London, and in other cities in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia.<ref target="#cite_note-nyt3-12">[12]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-nyt2-13">[13]</ref> The company also made a stop at the <ref target="/wiki/Cairo_Opera_House" title="Cairo Opera House">Cairo Opera House</ref> in Egypt in January 1955.<ref target="#cite_note-nyt3-12">[12]</ref> In 1955–1956 the company toured in cities in the Middle East, Africa, Russia, and Latin America.<ref target="#cite_note-14">[14]</ref></p>
<p>During this tour, Porgy and Bess was presented for the first time at <ref target="/wiki/La_Scala" title="La Scala">La Scala</ref> in Milan in February 1955.

<h3>1976 Houston Grand Opera production[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Porgy_and_Bess&action=edit&section=7" title="Edit section: 1976 Houston Grand Opera production">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>During the 1960s and early 1970s, Porgy and Bess mostly languished on the shelves, a victim of its perceived racism. Though new productions took place in 1961 and 1964, along with a <ref target="/wiki/Vienna_Volksoper" title="Vienna Volksoper">Vienna Volksoper</ref> premiere in 1965 (again with William Warfield as Porgy), these did little to change many African Americans' opinions of the work. Many music critics still had not accepted it as a true opera.</p>
<p>A new staging of Porgy and Bess was produced by the <ref target="/wiki/Houston_Grand_Opera" title="Houston Grand Opera">Houston Grand Opera</ref> in 1976 under music director <ref target="/wiki/John_DeMain" title="John DeMain">John DeMain</ref>; it restored the complete original score for the first time. Following its debut in Houston, the production opened on Broadway at the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Uris_Theatre" title="Uris Theatre">Uris Theatre</ref> on September 25, 1976 and was recorded complete by <ref target="/wiki/RCA_Records" title="RCA Records">RCA Records</ref>. This version was very influential in turning the tide of opinion about the work.</p>
<p>For the first time, an American opera company, not a Broadway production company, had tackled the opera. This production was based on Gershwin's original full score. It did not incorporate the cuts and other changes which Gershwin had made before the New York premiere, nor the ones made for the 1942 Cheryl Crawford revival or the <ref target="#1959_film">1959 film version</ref>. It allowed the public to take in the operatic whole as first envisioned by the composer. In this light, Porgy and Bess was accepted as an opera. <ref target="/wiki/Donnie_Ray_Albert" title="Donnie Ray Albert">Donnie Ray Albert</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Robert_Mosley" title="Robert Mosley">Robert Mosley</ref> alternated performances in the role of Porgy. <ref target="/wiki/Clamma_Dale" title="Clamma Dale">Clamma Dale</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Larry_Marshall_(actor)" title="Larry Marshall (actor)">Larry Marshall</ref> starred, respectively, as Bess and Sportin' Life. This production won the Houston Grand Opera a <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Award" title="Tony Award">Tony Award</ref>—the only opera ever to receive one—and a <ref target="/wiki/Grammy_Award" title="Grammy Award">Grammy Award</ref>.

<h3>Act 1[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Porgy_and_Bess&action=edit&section=14" title="Edit section: Act 1">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Scene 1: Catfish Row, a summer evening</p>
<p>The opera begins with a short introduction which segues into an evening in Catfish Row. Jasbo Brown entertains the community with his piano playing. Clara, a young mother, sings a lullaby to her baby ("<ref target="/wiki/Summertime_(George_Gershwin_song)" title="Summertime (George Gershwin song)">Summertime</ref>") as the working men prepare for a game of <ref target="/wiki/Craps" title="Craps">craps</ref> ("Roll them Bones"). One of the players, Robbins, scorns his wife Serena's demands that he not play, retorting that on a Saturday night, a man has the right to play. Clara's husband, the fisherman Jake, tries his own lullaby ("A Woman is a Sometime Thing") with little effect. Little by little, other characters in the opera enter Catfish Row, among them Mingo, another fisherman, and Jim, a <ref target="/wiki/Stevedore" title="Stevedore">stevedore</ref> who, tired of his job, decides to give it up and join Jake and the other fishermen. Porgy, a disabled beggar, enters on his goat cart to organize the game. Peter, an elderly "honey man"[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify">clarification needed</ref>] returns, singing his vendor's call. Crown, a strong and brutal stevedore, storms in with his woman, Bess, and buys cheap whiskey and some "<ref target="/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">Happy Dust</ref>" off the local dope peddler, Sportin' Life. Bess is shunned by the women of the community, especially the pious Serena and the matriarchal cookshop owner Maria, but Porgy softly defends her. The game begins. One by one, the players get crapped out, leaving only Robbins and Crown, who has become extremely drunk. When Robbins wins, Crown attempts to prevent him from taking his winnings. A brawl ensues, which ends when Crown stabs Robbins with a cotton hook, killing him. Crown runs, telling Bess to fend for herself but that he will be back for her when the heat dies down. Sportin' Life gives her a dose of happy dust and offers to take her with him when he goes to New York, but she rejects him. He flees, and Bess begins to pound on doors, but is rejected by all of the residents of Catfish Row, with the exception of Porgy, who lets her in.</p>
<p>Scene 2: Serena's Room, the following night</p>

<p>The mourners sing a spiritual to Robbins ("Gone, Gone, Gone"). To raise money for his burial, a saucer is placed on his chest for the mourners' donations ("Overflow"). Bess enters with Porgy and attempts to donate to the burial fund, but Serena rejects her money until Bess explains that she is now living with Porgy. A white detective enters and coldly tells Serena that she must bury her husband the next day, or his body will be given to medical students (for <ref target="/wiki/Dissection" title="Dissection">dissection</ref>). He suddenly accuses Peter of Robbins's murder. Peter denies his guilt and says Crown was the murderer. The Detective orders Peter to be arrested as a <ref target="/wiki/Material_witness" title="Material witness">material witness</ref>, whom he will force to testify against Crown. Serena laments her loss in "<ref target="/wiki/My_Man%27s_Gone_Now" title="My Man's Gone Now">My Man's Gone Now</ref>". The undertaker enters. The saucer holds only fifteen dollars of the needed twenty-five, but he agrees to bury Robbins as long as Serena promises to pay him back. Bess, who has been sitting in silence slightly apart from the rest of those gathered, suddenly begins to sing a gospel song and the chorus joyfully join in, welcoming her into the community. ("Oh, the Train is at de Station")</p>

<h3>Act 2[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Porgy_and_Bess&action=edit&section=15" title="Edit section: Act 2">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Scene 1: Catfish Row, a month later, in the morning</p>
<p>Jake and the other fishermen prepare for work ("It take a long pull to get there"). Clara asks Jake not to go because it is time for the annual storms, but he tells her that they desperately need the money. This causes Porgy to sing from his window about his new, happy-go-lucky outlook on life. ("I got plenty o' nuttin"). Sportin' Life waltzes around selling "happy dust", but soon incurs the wrath of Maria, who threatens him. ("I hates yo' struttin' style"). A fraudulent lawyer, Frazier, arrives and farcically divorces Bess from Crown. When he discovers Bess and Crown were not married, he raises his price from a dollar to a dollar and a half. Archdale, a white lawyer, enters and informs Porgy that Peter will soon be released. The bad omen of a buzzard flies over Catfish Row and Porgy demands that it leave now that he finally has found happiness. ("Buzzard keep on flyin' over".)</p>
<p>As the rest of Catfish Row prepares for the church picnic on nearby Kittiwah Island, Sportin' Life again offers to take Bess to New York with him; she refuses. He attempts to give her some "happy dust" despite her claims that she's given up drugs, but Porgy grabs his arm and scares him off. Sportin' Life leaves, reminding Bess as he goes that her men friends come and go, but he will be there all along. Bess and Porgy are now left alone, and express their love for each other ("<ref target="/wiki/Bess,_You_Is_My_Woman_Now" title="Bess, You Is My Woman Now">Bess, You Is My Woman Now</ref>"). The chorus re-enters in high spirits as they prepare to leave for the picnic ("Oh, I can't sit down"). Bess is invited to the picnic by Maria, but she demurs as Porgy cannot come (due to his disability, he cannot get on the boat), but Maria insists. Bess leaves Porgy behind as they go off to the picnic. Porgy watches the boat leave ("I got plenty o' nuttin" reprise).</p>
<p>Scene 2: Kittiwah Island, that evening</p>
<p>The chorus enjoys themselves at the picnic ("I ain't got no shame"). Sportin' Life presents the chorus his cynical views on the Bible ("<ref target="/wiki/It_Ain%27t_Necessarily_So" title="It Ain't Necessarily So">It Ain't Necessarily So</ref>"), causing Serena to chastise them ("Shame on all you sinners!"). Everyone gets ready to leave. As Bess, who has lagged behind, tries to follow them, Crown emerges from the bushes. He reminds her that Porgy is "temporary" and laughs off her claims that she has been living decently now. Bess wants to leave Crown forever and attempts to make him forget about her ("Oh, what you want wid Bess?") but Crown refuses to give her up. He grabs her and will not let her go to the boat, which leaves without her, and then forcefully kisses her. He laughs at his conquest as her resistance begins to fail, and commands her to get into the woods, where his intentions are only too clear.</p>
<p>Scene 3: Catfish Row, a week later, just before dawn</p>
<p>A week later, Jake leaves to go fishing with his crew, one of whom observes that it looks as if a storm is coming in. Peter, still unsure of his crime, returns from prison. Meanwhile, Bess is lying in Porgy's room delirious with fever, which she has had ever since returning from Kittiwah Island. Serena prays to remove Bess's affliction ("Oh, Doctor Jesus"), and promises Porgy that Bess will be well by five o'clock. As the day passes, a strawberry woman, Peter (the Honey Man) and a crab man each pass by with their wares ("Vendors' Trio"). As the clock chimes five, Bess recovers from her fever. Porgy tells Bess that he knows she has been with Crown, and she admits that Crown has promised to return for her. Porgy tells her she is free to go if she wants to, and she tells him that although she wants to stay, she is afraid of Crown's hold on her. Porgy asks her what would happen if there was no Crown, and Bess tells Porgy she loves him and begs him to protect her. Porgy promises that she will never have to be afraid again ("<ref target="/wiki/I_Loves_You,_Porgy" title="I Loves You, Porgy">I Loves You, Porgy</ref>").</p>
<p>Clara watches the water, fearful for Jake. Maria tries to allay her fears, but suddenly the hurricane bell begins to ring.</p>
<p>Scene 4: Serena's Room, dawn of the next day</p>
<p>The residents of Catfish Row are all gathered in Serena's room for shelter from the hurricane. They drown out the sound of the storm with prayers and hymns ("Oh, Doctor Jesus") while Sportin' Life mocks their assumption that the storm is a signal of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Judgment_Day" title="Judgment Day">Judgment Day</ref>. Clara desperately sings her lullaby ("Summertime" [reprise]). A knock is heard at the door, and the chorus believes it to be Death ("Oh there's somebody knocking at the door"). Crown enters dramatically, having swum from Kittiwah Island, seeking Bess. He shows no fear of God, claiming that after the long struggle from Kittiwah, God and he are friends. The chorus tries to drown out his blaspheming with more prayer, and he taunts them by singing a vulgar song. ("A red-headed woman"). Suddenly, Clara sees Jake's boat float past the window, upside-down, and she runs out to try to save him, handing her baby to Bess. Bess asks that one of the men go out with her, and Crown taunts Porgy, who cannot go. Crown goes himself, yelling out as he leaves "Alright, Big Friend! We're on for another Bout!" The chorus continue to pray as the storm rises.</p>

<h3>Act 3[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Porgy_and_Bess&action=edit&section=16" title="Edit section: Act 3">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Scene 1: Catfish Row, the next night</p>
<p>A group of women mourn Clara, Jake, and all of those who have been killed in the storm ("Clara, Clara, don't you be downhearted"). When they begin to mourn for Crown as well, Sportin' Life laughs at them and is told off by Maria. He insinuates that Crown may not be dead, and observes that when a woman has a man, maybe she's got him for keeps, but if she has two men, then it's highly likely she'll end up with none. Bess is heard singing Clara's lullaby to her baby, whom she is now taking care of. ("Summertime" [reprise]). Once Catfish Row is dark, Crown stealthily enters to claim Bess, but is confronted by Porgy. A fight ensues that ends when Porgy kills Crown. Porgy exclaims to Bess, "You've got a man now. You've got Porgy!"</p>
<p>Scene 2: Catfish Row, the next afternoon</p>
<p>The detective enters and talks with Serena and her friends about the murders of Crown and Robbins. They deny knowledge of Crown's murder, frustrating the detective. Needing a witness for the coroner's inquest, he next questions an apprehensive Porgy. Once Porgy admits to knowing Crown, he is ordered to come and identify Crown's body. Sportin' Life tells Porgy that corpses bleed in the presence of their murderers, and the detective will use this to hang Porgy. Porgy refuses to identify the body, but is dragged off anyway. Bess is distraught, and Sportin' Life puts his plan into action. He tells her that Porgy will be locked up for a long time, and points out that he is the only one still here. He offers her happy dust, and though she refuses, he forces it on her. After she takes a whiff, he paints a seductive picture of her life with him in New York ("There's a boat dat's leavin' soon for New York"). She regains her strength and rushes inside, slamming the door on his face, but he leaves a packet of happy dust on her doorstep, and settles down to wait.</p>
<p>Scene 3: Catfish Row, a week later</p>
<p>On a beautiful morning, Porgy is released from jail, where he has been arrested for contempt of court after refusing to look at Crown's body. He returns to Catfish Row much richer after playing craps with his cellmates. He gives gifts to the residents, and pulls out a beautiful red dress for Bess. He does not understand why everyone seems so uneasy at his return. He sees Clara's baby is now with Serena and realizes something is wrong. He asks where Bess is. Maria and Serena tell him that Bess has run off with Sportin' Life to New York ("Oh Bess, Oh Where's my Bess?"). Porgy calls for his goat cart, and resolves to leave Catfish Row to find her. He prays for strength, and begins his journey. ("Oh, Lawd, I'm on my way")</p>

<h2>Racial controversy[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Porgy_and_Bess&action=edit&section=17" title="Edit section: Racial controversy">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>From the outset, the opera's depiction of <ref target="/wiki/African_Americans" title="African Americans">African Americans</ref> attracted controversy. <ref target="/wiki/Virgil_Thomson" title="Virgil Thomson">Virgil Thomson</ref>, a white American composer, stated that "Folklore subjects recounted by an outsider are only valid as long as the folk in question is unable to speak for itself, which is certainly not true of the American Negro in 1935."<ref target="#cite_note-31">[31]</ref> An apocryphal quote attributed to <ref target="/wiki/Duke_Ellington" title="Duke Ellington">Duke Ellington</ref> allegedly stated "the times are here to debunk Gershwin's lampblack Negroisms,” but the quote was probably invented by a journalist who interviewed Ellington about the opera. Ellington publicly repudiated the article shortly after its publication.<ref target="#cite_note-32">[32]</ref> Ellington's response to the 1952 Breen revival was completely the opposite. His telegram to the producer read: "Your Porgy and Bess the superbest, singing the gonest, acting the craziest, Gershwin the greatest."<ref target="#cite_note-33">[33]</ref> Several of the members of the original cast later stated that they, too, had concerns that their characters might play into a <ref target="/wiki/Stereotype" title="Stereotype">stereotype</ref> that African Americans lived in poverty, took drugs and solved their problems with their fists.</p>
<p>A planned production by the Negro Repertory Company of Seattle in the late 1930s, part of the <ref target="/wiki/Federal_Theatre_Project" title="Federal Theatre Project">Federal Theatre Project</ref>, was cancelled because actors were displeased with what they viewed as a <ref target="/wiki/Racism" title="Racism">racist</ref> portrayal of aspects of African-American life. The director initially envisioned that they would perform the play in a "<ref target="/wiki/Negro" title="Negro">Negro</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Dialect" title="Dialect">dialect</ref>." These <ref target="/wiki/Pacific_Northwest" title="Pacific Northwest">Pacific Northwest</ref> African American actors, who did not speak in such dialect, would be coached in it. Florence James attempted a compromise of dropping the use of dialect but the production was canceled.<ref target="#cite_note-34">[34]</ref></p>
<p>Another production of Porgy and Bess, this time at the <ref target="/wiki/University_of_Minnesota" title="University of Minnesota">University of Minnesota</ref> in 1939, ran into similar troubles. According to Barbara Cyrus, one of the few black students then at the university, members of the local African-American community saw the play as "detrimental to the race" and as a vehicle that promoted racist stereotypes. The play was cancelled due to pressure from the African-American community, which saw their success as proof of the increasing political power of blacks in <ref target="/wiki/Minneapolis%E2%80%93Saint_Paul" title="Minneapolis–Saint Paul">Minneapolis–Saint Paul</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-35">[35]</ref></p>
<p>The belief that Porgy and Bess was racist gained strength during the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement" title="Civil Rights Movement">Civil Rights Movement</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Black_Power_movement" title="Black Power movement">Black Power movement</ref> of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. As these movements advanced, Porgy and Bess was seen as more and more out of date. When the play was revived in the 1960s, social critic and African-American educator <ref target="/wiki/Harold_Cruse" title="Harold Cruse">Harold Cruse</ref> called it, "The most incongruous, contradictory cultural symbol ever created in the Western World."<ref target="#cite_note-JS-9">[9]</ref></p>
<p>In the 1976 Houston Opera production, the director, Sherwin Goldman, had trouble finding interested performers. Goldman, a white Texas native and a graduate of Yale and Oxford Universities, recalled, "I was auditioning singers all around the country, I guess thirty cities in all, from theater groups to church choirs, but was having a hard time finding directors ... I don't think there was a single black person, of those who had never been associated with Porgy, who didn't seriously bad-mouth it." Nevertheless, a cast was assembled of African American classically trained performers from all around the country.<ref target="#cite_note-36">[36]</ref></p>

<p>Gershwin's all-black opera was also unpopular with some celebrated black artists. <ref target="/wiki/Harry_Belafonte" title="Harry Belafonte">Harry Belafonte</ref> declined to play Porgy in the late 1950s film version, so the role went to <ref target="/wiki/Sidney_Poitier" title="Sidney Poitier">Sidney Poitier</ref>. Betty Allen, president of <ref target="/wiki/The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts" title="The Harlem School of the Arts">The Harlem School of the Arts</ref>, admittedly loathed the piece, and <ref target="/wiki/Grace_Bumbry" title="Grace Bumbry">Grace Bumbry</ref>, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My way of dealing with it was to see that it was really a piece of <ref target="/wiki/Americana" title="Americana">Americana</ref>, of American history, whether we liked it or not. Whether I sing it or not, it was still going to be there.<ref target="#cite_note-JS-9">[9]</ref></p>
<p>Over time, however, the opera gained acceptance from the opera community and some (though not all)<ref target="#cite_note-37">[37]</ref> in the African-American community. Maurice Peress stated in 2004 that "Porgy and Bess belongs as much to the black singer-actors who bring it to life as it does to the Heywards and the Gershwins."<ref target="#cite_note-38">[38]</ref> Indeed, Ira Gershwin stipulated that only blacks be allowed to play the lead roles when the opera was performed in the United States, launching the careers of several prominent opera singers.</p>
<p>That Gershwin sought to write a true jazz opera, and that he believed that <ref target="/wiki/Metropolitan_Opera" title="Metropolitan Opera">Metropolitan Opera</ref> staff singers could never master the jazz idiom, but could instead only be sung by a black cast, seems to indicate he did not intend the work to belittle African-Americans. Some black singers were overjoyed at Gershwin's work going so far as to describe him as the "Abraham Lincoln of Negro music".<ref target="#cite_note-39">[39]</ref> The source of much of the racial controversy seems to arise from the miscegenation of Gershwin's jazz experience. Gershwin wrote Porgy through an idiom of jazz that was influenced by Western European opera traditions, African-American music, and Russian-Jewish music.<ref target="#cite_note-40">[40]</ref></p>
<p>During the era of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Apartheid_in_South_Africa" title="Apartheid in South Africa">apartheid in South Africa</ref>, several South African theatre companies planned to put on all-white productions of Porgy and Bess. <ref target="/wiki/Ira_Gershwin" title="Ira Gershwin">Ira Gershwin</ref>, as heir to his brother, consistently refused to permit these productions to be staged. But in 2009, <ref target="/wiki/Cape_Town_Opera" title="Cape Town Opera">Cape Town Opera</ref>'s production, set in 1970s South Africa and inspired by life in <ref target="/wiki/Soweto" title="Soweto">Soweto</ref>, toured Britain, opening at the <ref target="/wiki/Wales_Millennium_Centre" title="Wales Millennium Centre">Wales Millennium Centre</ref> in Cardiff and going on to the <ref target="/wiki/Royal_Festival_Hall" title="Royal Festival Hall">Royal Festival Hall</ref> in London and <ref target="/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Theatre" title="Edinburgh Festival Theatre">Edinburgh Festival Theatre</ref>. Most of the cast were black South Africans; American singers involved in the production have found the "passionate identification with the opera" by the South African singers "a wake-up call".</p>

<p>A 2017/2018 staging of the opera by the <ref target="/wiki/Hungarian_State_Opera" title="Hungarian State Opera">Hungarian State Opera</ref> featured a predominantly white cast. While the opera was presented in the context of the <ref target="/wiki/Refugees_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War" title="Refugees of the Syrian Civil War">Syrian migrant crisis</ref> (moved from Catfish Row to an airport), the controversy of recasting continued. While the Hungarian State Opera, in discussions with the <ref target="/wiki/Tams-Witmark_Music_Library" title="Tams-Witmark Music Library">Tams-Witmark Music Library</ref> originally agreed to the casting requirements, it ultimately declined to do so when the wording was not included in the written contract. This production galvanized conservative commentators who lauded it as a success over "political correctness". Ultimately, Tams-Witmark required the Hungarian State Opera to include in its printed material that this production "is contrary to the requirements for the presentation of this work.".<ref target="#cite_note-42">[42]</ref></p>

<h2>Musical elements[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Porgy_and_Bess&action=edit&section=18" title="Edit section: Musical elements">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>In the summer of 1934, George Gershwin worked on the opera in <ref target="/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina" title="Charleston, South Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</ref>. He drew inspiration from the James Island <ref target="/wiki/Gullah" title="Gullah">Gullah</ref> community, which he felt had preserved some African musical traditions. This research added to the authenticity of his work.<ref target="#cite_note-43">[43]</ref></p>
<p>The music itself reflects his New York jazz roots, but also draws on southern black traditions. Gershwin modeled the pieces after each type of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Folk_song" title="Folk song">folk song</ref> which the composer knew about; jubilees, <ref target="/wiki/Blues" title="Blues">blues</ref>, praying songs, street cries, work songs, and spirituals are blended with traditional <ref target="/wiki/Aria" title="Aria">arias</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Recitative" title="Recitative">recitatives</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-JS-9">[9]</ref></p>
<p>The most fundamental influences on the composition and orchestrations in evidence throughout Porgy and Bess, aside from those of American Jazz and Black religious music, are the European composers whose music Gershwin studied and absorbed during his tutelage with the likes of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Edward_Kilenyi" title="Edward Kilenyi">Edward Kilenyi</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Rubin_Goldmark" title="Rubin Goldmark">Rubin Goldmark</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Charles_Hambitzer" title="Charles Hambitzer">Charles Hambitzer</ref>, and <ref target="/wiki/Henry_Cowell" title="Henry Cowell">Henry Cowell</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-44">[44]</ref> Cowell's key contribution, however, may have been to suggest that Gershwin study with <ref target="/wiki/Joseph_Schillinger" title="Joseph Schillinger">Joseph Schillinger</ref>,<ref target="#cite_note-45">[45]</ref> whose influence, if not as important as his followers claim, is notable throughout. Some commenters have believed they heard simililarities to melodies heard in <ref target="/wiki/Jewish_music" title="Jewish music">Jewish liturgical music</ref> in Gershwin's opera. Gershwin biographer <ref target="/wiki/Edward_Jablonski" title="Edward Jablonski">Edward Jablonski</ref> heard a similarity between the melody of "It Ain't Necessarily So" and the <ref target="/wiki/Haftarah#Haftarah_cantillation" title="Haftarah">Haftarah blessing</ref>,<ref target="#cite_note-46">[46]</ref> while others hear similarities with <ref target="/wiki/Torah_reading" title="Torah reading">Torah blessing</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-47">[47]</ref> In a sociological survey of Jewish American culture, the author remarked, "One musicologist detected 'an uncanny resemblance' between the folk tune 'Havenu [sic] Shalom Aleichem' and the spiritual [sic] 'It Take a Long Pull to Get There' from Porgy and Bess."<ref target="#cite_note-48">[48]</ref></p>
<p>The score makes use of a series of <ref target="/wiki/Leitmotif" title="Leitmotif">leitmotifs</ref>. Many of these represent individual characters: some of these are fragments of the opera's set numbers (Sportin' Life, for example, is frequently represented by the melody which sets the title words of "It Ain't Necessarily So"). Other motifs represent objects (such as the sleazy chromatic "Happy Dust" motif) or places, notably Catfish Row. Many of the through-composed passages of the score combine or develop these leitmotifs in order to reflect the on-stage action. Particularly sophisticated uses of this techniques can be seen after the aria "There's a boat dat's leaving soon for New York" in act 3, scene 2. The opera also frequently reprises its set numbers (these might be considered extended Leitsektionen). Notable in this respect are the reprises of "Bess, you is my woman now" and "I got plenty o' nuttin' " which conclude act 2, scene 1. The song "<ref target="/wiki/Summertime_(George_Gershwin_song)" title="Summertime (George Gershwin song)">Summertime</ref>" is stated four times alone.</p>
<p>The duration of the work is about 180 minutes.</p>

<p>Although members of the jazz community initially felt that a Jewish piano player and a white novelist could not adequately convey the plight of blacks in a 1930s Charleston ghetto, jazz musicians warmed up more to the opera after twenty years, and more jazz-based recordings of it began to appear. <ref target="/wiki/Louis_Armstrong" title="Louis Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Ella_Fitzgerald" title="Ella Fitzgerald">Ella Fitzgerald</ref> recorded <ref target="/wiki/Porgy_and_Bess_(Ella_Fitzgerald_and_Louis_Armstrong_album)" title="Porgy and Bess (Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong album)">an album in 1957</ref> in which they sang and scatted Gershwin's tunes.

<p>In 1959, <ref target="/wiki/Columbia_Masterworks_Records" title="Columbia Masterworks Records">Columbia Masterworks Records</ref> released a soundtrack album of Samuel Goldwyn's film version of Porgy and Bess, which had been made that year. It was not a complete version of the opera, nor was it even a complete version of the film soundtrack, which featured more music than could be contained on a single LP. The album remained in print until the early 1970s, when it was withdrawn from stores at the request of the Gershwin estate. It is the first stereo album of music from Porgy and Bess with an all-black cast. However, according to the album <ref target="/wiki/Liner_notes" title="Liner notes">liner notes</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Sammy_Davis_Jr." title="Sammy Davis Jr.">Sammy Davis Jr.</ref> was under contract to another recording company, and his vocal tracks for the film could not be used on the album. <ref target="/wiki/Cab_Calloway" title="Cab Calloway">Cab Calloway</ref> substituted his own vocals of Sportin' Life's songs. <ref target="/wiki/Robert_McFerrin" title="Robert McFerrin">Robert McFerrin</ref> was the singing voice of Porgy, and <ref target="/wiki/Adele_Addison" title="Adele Addison">Adele Addison</ref> the singing voice of Bess.

<h3>Complete recordings[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Porgy_and_Bess&action=edit&section=22" title="Edit section: Complete recordings">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>1951: <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Columbia_Masterworks" title="Columbia Masterworks">Columbia Masterworks</ref>: the company recorded a 3-LP album of what was then the standard performing version of Porgy and Bess – the most complete recording made of the opera up to that time. It was billed as a "complete" version, but was complete only insofar as that was the way the work was usually performed then. (Actually, nearly an hour was cut from the opera.) Because album producer <ref target="/wiki/Goddard_Lieberson" title="Goddard Lieberson">Goddard Lieberson</ref> was eager to bring as much of Porgy and Bess as he felt was practical on records at the time, the recording featured more of Gershwin's original recitatives and orchestrations than had ever been heard before. The recording was conducted by <ref target="/wiki/Lehman_Engel" title="Lehman Engel">Lehman Engel</ref>, and starred <ref target="/wiki/Lawrence_Winters" title="Lawrence Winters">Lawrence Winters</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Camilla_Williams" title="Camilla Williams">Camilla Williams</ref>, both from the <ref target="/wiki/New_York_City_Opera" title="New York City Opera">New York City Opera</ref>. Several singers who had been associated with the original 1935 production and the 1942 revival of Porgy and Bess were finally given a chance to record their roles more or less complete. The album was highly acclaimed as a giant step in recorded opera in its time. It was re-released at budget price on the Odyssey label in the early 1970s. It has subsequently appeared on CD on Sony's "Masterworks Heritage" CD series, and on the Naxos label as well. The album is not sung in as directly "operatic" a style as later versions, treading a fine line between opera and musical theatre.</p>

<p>The Gershwin estate was disappointed with the film, as the score was substantially edited to make it more like a <ref target="/wiki/Musical_theatre" title="Musical theatre">musical</ref>. Much of the music was omitted from the film, and many of Gershwin's orchestrations were either changed or completely scrapped. It was shown on <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Network_television" title="Network television">network television</ref> in the U.S. only once, in 1967. Critics attacked it for not being faithful to Gershwin's opera, for over-refining the language grammatically, and for its "overblown" staging. The film was removed from release in 1974 by the Gershwin estate.

<h4>Other films[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Porgy_and_Bess&action=edit&section=26" title="Edit section: Other films">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>The 1945 <ref target="/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</ref> film biography of Gershwin, <ref target="/wiki/Rhapsody_in_Blue_(film)" title="Rhapsody in Blue (film)">Rhapsody in Blue</ref>, featured an extended musical scene recreating the opening of the original Broadway production of Porgy and Bess. Included was the original Bess, Anne Brown, recreating her performance. The scene includes a more elaborate (and historically inaccurate) arrangement for the film of the song "Summertime", sung by Anne Brown as Bess with full chorus, but the Catfish Row set design is a virtual duplicate of the one seen in the 1935 Broadway stage production.</p>
<p>The 1985 film <ref target="/wiki/White_Nights_(1985_film)" title="White Nights (1985 film)">White Nights</ref> featured a scene in which <ref target="/wiki/Gregory_Hines" title="Gregory Hines">Gregory Hines</ref> performed "There's a Boat Dat's Leavin' Soon for New York" as Sportin' Life. Hines' rendition, before a Siberian audience, included a <ref target="/wiki/Tap_dance" title="Tap dance">tap dancing</ref> sequence. Director <ref target="/wiki/Taylor_Hackford" title="Taylor Hackford">Taylor Hackford</ref> pointed out in a special edition DVD release of the film that it was necessary to locate a Russian woman of color (Helene Denbey) to portray Bess, as per Gershwin's stipulations.</p>

<h3>Television[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Porgy_and_Bess&action=edit&section=27" title="Edit section: Television">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>In 1993, Trevor Nunn's Glyndebourne Festival stage production of Porgy and Bess, not to be confused with his later production, was greatly expanded scenically and <ref target="/wiki/Videotape" title="Videotape">videotaped</ref> in a <ref target="/wiki/Television" title="Television">television</ref> studio without an audience. This first Nunn production was also called The Gershwins' 'Porgy and Bess' when shown on television. It was telecast by the BBC in England and by PBS in the United States. It featured a cast of operatic American singers, with the exception of Willard White, who is Jamaican but sounded American, as Porgy. <ref target="/wiki/Cynthia_Haymon" title="Cynthia Haymon">Cynthia Haymon</ref> sang the role of Bess. Nunn's "opening up" of the stage production was considered highly imaginative; his cast received much critical praise,<ref target="#cite_note-62">[62]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-63">[63]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-64">[64]</ref> and the three-hour production retained nearly all of Gershwin's music, heard in the original 1935 orchestrations. This included the opera's sung recitatives, which have occasionally been turned into spoken dialogue in other productions. No extra dialogue was written for this production, as had been done in the 1959 film. All performers lip-synched rather than singing live on set, leading <ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref> to write: "What you hear is basically Mr. Nunn's acclaimed Glyndebourne Festival production, the original cast intact. What you see was filmed later in a London studio. The performers, some new to the production, are lip-synching. It's as if an elaborate visual aid had been concocted for the EMI recording."</p>
<p>This Porgy and Bess production was subsequently released on <ref target="/wiki/VHS" title="VHS">VHS</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</ref>. It has won far greater acclaim than the 1959 film, which was widely panned by most critics. The 1993 television production of Porgy and Bess was nominated for four <ref target="/wiki/Emmy_Award" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Awards</ref>, and won for its <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Art_direction" title="Art direction">art direction</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-65">[65]</ref> It also won a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/BAFTA" title="BAFTA">BAFTA</ref> Award for Best Video Lighting.<ref target="#cite_note-66">[66]</ref></p>
<p>In 2002, the <ref target="/wiki/New_York_City_Opera" title="New York City Opera">New York City Opera</ref> telecast its new version of the Houston Opera production, in a live performance from the stage of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lincoln_Center" title="Lincoln Center">Lincoln Center</ref>. This version featured far more cuts than the previous telecast, but, like nearly all stage versions produced since 1976, used the sung recitatives and Gershwin's orchestrations. The telecast also included interviews with director <ref target="/wiki/Tazewell_Thompson" title="Tazewell Thompson">Tazewell Thompson</ref> and was hosted by <ref target="/wiki/Beverly_Sills" title="Beverly Sills">Beverly Sills</ref>.</p>
<p>In 2009 the San Francisco Opera debuted the Gershwins' Porgy and Bess to critical acclaim. The production was recorded at that time and shown on PBS in the fall of 2014, and was later released on <ref target="/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Blu-ray" title="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</ref>.</p>

<h3>Radio[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Porgy_and_Bess&action=edit&section=28" title="Edit section: Radio">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>On December 1, 1935, during the Broadway run, Todd Duncan and Anne Brown performed "Summertime", "I Got Plenty o' Nuttin'" and "Bess, You Is My Woman Now" on NBC's <ref target="/wiki/The_Magic_Key_of_RCA" title="The Magic Key of RCA">The Magic Key of RCA</ref> radio program. Duncan and Brown also appeared on the 1937 CBS Gershwin memorial concert on September 8, 1937, broadcast from the <ref target="/wiki/Hollywood_Bowl" title="Hollywood Bowl">Hollywood Bowl</ref> less than two months after the composer's death, along with several other members of the Broadway cast, including <ref target="/wiki/John_W._Bubbles" title="John W. Bubbles">John W. Bubbles</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Ruby_Elzy" title="Ruby Elzy">Ruby Elzy</ref>. They performed several selections from the opera.</p>
<p>The complete Porgy and Bess has been broadcast by the Metropolitan Opera three times as part of the <ref target="/wiki/Metropolitan_Opera_radio_broadcasts" title="Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts">Met's live radio broadcast series</ref>.

In 1990, Estes and <ref target="/wiki/Leona_Mitchell" title="Leona Mitchell">Leona Mitchell</ref> sang the leads in the third broadcast.</p>

<h3>Concert[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Porgy_and_Bess&action=edit&section=29" title="Edit section: Concert">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Gershwin prepared an orchestral suite containing music from the opera after Porgy and Bess closed early on Broadway. Though it was originally titled "Suite from Porgy and Bess", Ira later renamed it <ref target="/wiki/Catfish_Row" title="Catfish Row">Catfish Row</ref>.</p>
<p>In 1942 <ref target="/wiki/Robert_Russell_Bennett" title="Robert Russell Bennett">Robert Russell Bennett</ref> arranged a medley (rather than a suite) for orchestra which has often been heard in the concert hall, known as <ref target="/wiki/Porgy_and_Bess:_A_Symphonic_Picture" title="Porgy and Bess: A Symphonic Picture">Porgy and Bess: A Symphonic Picture</ref>. It is based on Gershwin's original scoring, though for a slightly different instrumentation (the piano was removed from the orchestral texture at the request of the conductor <ref target="/wiki/Fritz_Reiner" title="Fritz Reiner">Fritz Reiner</ref>, for whom the arrangement was made). <ref target="/wiki/Morton_Gould" title="Morton Gould">Morton Gould</ref> also arranged an orchestral suite in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Bennett's 40-minute Porgy and Bess, a concert version for soprano and baritone soloists, chorus and orchestra was prepared in 1956. It is based very closely on Gershwin's original instrumental and vocal scoring, the principal recasting being the use of standard concert-orchestra instrumentation, eliminating the clarinet-saxophone doubling specified in Gershwin's 1935 orchestration.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>]</p>

<h3>Piano[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Porgy_and_Bess&action=edit&section=30" title="Edit section: Piano">edit</ref>]</h3>
