<h2>Plot summary[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Buried_Child&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Plot summary">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Act I[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Buried_Child&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Act I">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>In an old farmhouse on a failed plot of land in <ref target="/wiki/Illinois" title="Illinois">Illinois</ref>, the characters Dodge and Halie are introduced. The scene begins with the couple having a conversation with one another, discussing events of their past. Halie is not visible in the scene as she is yelling from upstairs, while Dodge is sitting on the basement sofa. He occasionally sneaks drinks from a bottle hidden in the couch; it is evident that he is an <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alcoholic" title="Alcoholic">alcoholic</ref>. They talk about their beloved son Ansel, who was murdered years before by his psychotic, Catholic wife on their wedding night. They also talk about another son, Bradley, an amputee who comes to cut Dodge's hair forcefully while he sleeps; Dodge is wearing a baseball cap to ward off this inevitability.</p>
<p>Halie leaves for church dressed in black and tells the oldest son, Tilden, to look after Dodge. Tilden then enters the scene with an armful of corn, which he claims grew in the field outside. Dodge states that nothing has grown in the field since the <ref target="/wiki/Dust_Bowl" title="Dust Bowl">Dust Bowl</ref>, and accuses Tilden of stealing from a neighbor. Dodge and Tilden then begin to discuss Tilden's past; they speak of how he "got into trouble" in <ref target="/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</ref>, and how in failing his attempt to leave the family home for a new life, Tilden was forced to flee following this incident. Tilden is evidently mentally unwell as he sits, shucking corn into a bucket. When Dodge falls asleep at the end of their conversation, Tilden covers him with the corn husks, creating a blanket, before he goes outside into the rain. Bradley enters the room shortly after and shaves Dodge's head while he sleeps.</p>

<h3>Act II[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Buried_Child&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Act II">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The scene begins with the introduction of Vince and Shelly. Vince was headed to meet his father, Tilden, in New Mexico but has decided to stop over at his grandparents' house on the way there; Shelly is just tagging along for the ride. Vince is surprised when he enters the house as Dodge does not recognize him at all. Shelly then believes they have entered the wrong house and tries to convince Vince to leave, but he does not budge. Tilden then enters the room with a bundle of carrots and is uninterested in Shelly and Vince. Vince then gets Tilden's attention, but Tilden also does not recognize Vince.</p>
<p>Vince tries different methods to convince Tilden and Dodge of his identity, while Shelly helps Tilden with the carrots. Dodge then motions to Vince and tells him to go buy him alcohol, and he does so. While he is gone, Shelly talks to Tilden and asks him questions about Vince. Tilden goes on saying that he does not recognize Vince but he does look familiar. Tilden also talks about the son he had a long time ago with his mother, Halie, but Dodge had killed the baby and buried him in the backyard. Bradley then re-enters the scene and begins to harass Shelly by sticking his hand in her mouth. He then takes a fur coat and places it over Dodge and blacks out.</p>

<h3>Act III[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Buried_Child&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Act III">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The scene begins with Dodge presuming that Vince has run away and left Shelly. He also tells Shelly not to fear Bradley as he only has one leg. After some time, Halie enters the house with Father Dewis, with whom the audience later learns she is having an affair. Halie sees Dodge and Bradley lying shamelessly on the sofa and smiles in embarrassment to Father Dewis. She then starts a yelling match with Dodge and Bradley, and they exchange several words until Shelly intervenes. In frustration, Shelly grabs Bradley's wooden leg and waves off the rest of the family, expressing her anger with them and Vince. Father Dewis tries to calm Shelly down and places the wooden leg onto the table.</p>
<p>Soon after, Vince returns drunk and hurls beer bottles at the house. He then climbs through the door's netting and states that he has to stay at the farmhouse with his family. Halie and Dodge then recognize Vince, and Dodge hands him the ownership of the house and land. With the land now his, Vince decides to stay at the house, while Shelly tries to convince him to leave. Shelly gives up on Vince and leaves, and Vince grabs the wooden leg and throws it outside the house; Bradley goes crawling for it. Father Dewis leaves the house and Halie heads upstairs to her room. Vince realizes that Dodge has died and places a blanket and rose on his body. Halie then begins to yell out that corn has bloomed in the backyard, while Vince sits motionless on the sofa. In the final scene, Tilden walks around the room with the corpse of a baby in his hands.</p>

<h3>Disappointment and disillusionment[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Buried_Child&action=edit&section=7" title="Edit section: Disappointment and disillusionment">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The character of Ansel; he is the son Halie idolizes as an <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/All-American" title="All-American">All-American</ref> hero, despite his death due to suspicious circumstances in a motel room. Halie fantasizes about his potential to be a hero, an All-American star basketball player, reflecting the American hope in the youth. Yet his death and subsequent denouncement reflects the disappointment and disillusionment which many people experienced when they realize the actuality of the American circumstance.</p>
<p>The two sons (Tilden and Bradley) both failed their parents' expectation. Both are expected to take over the farm or at least care for the parents in their old age, thus fulfilling the American mythology of the next generation taking over from the last. However both sons are handicapped – Tilden emotionally and Bradley physically. They are unable to care for their parents and thus unable to carry out the <ref target="/wiki/American_Dream" title="American Dream">American Dream</ref>.</p>
<p>Dodge felt the failure of the farm and the family as whole. He had failed to make the farm successful, he had not even planted any type of crop for over thirty years. He felt he had not lived up to what a typical American family's dream should have been. The play often shows the father as generally sitting around doing very little, steeped in a major depression.</p>
<p>The character of Shelly is used to show the audience what the ideal family should be. Her disgust with what she expects and what is actually reality helps to show the audience what the American dream should be.</p>
<h3>1970s economic slowdown[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Buried_Child&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: 1970s economic slowdown">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The house itself is run down, reflecting the poverty of American farms.</p>
<p>Nothing has been planted in the fields.</p>
<h3>Breakdown of traditional family structures and values[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Buried_Child&action=edit&section=9" title="Edit section: Breakdown of traditional family structures and values">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Dodge, the ineffectual patriarch, is meant to be the breadwinner and ethical guardian of the family. Instead, he takes on the role of a sardonic alcoholic who is bullied by his wife and children, and thus disempowered through their actions. His character reflects patriarchs in America who have failed to create the family environments idealised in the <ref target="/wiki/American_Dream" title="American Dream">American Dream</ref>.</p>
<p>The act of incest and the resultant murder are indicative of a breakdown in the ethical rigidity which characterizes the typical American family.</p>
<p>The character of Father Dewis, adulterous and unauthoritative, fails to fulfill the role of moral guardian assigned to him by society, thus reflecting the breakdown of morality and ethics within America.</p>
<h2>Production[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Buried_Child&action=edit&section=10" title="Edit section: Production">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Shepard's intention[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Buried_Child&action=edit&section=11" title="Edit section: Shepard's intention">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Shepard's intention was to create a narrative that communicated and reflected the frustrations of American people, but at the same time was engaging and entertaining. Set in a context which is easily recognizable, the American farming family, and centered around issues which are universal, the disillusionment with the American dream and the traditional patriarch, Buried Child reflects the frustrations of American people. The <ref target="/wiki/Postmodernism" title="Postmodernism">postmodern</ref> style that Shepard uses incorporates <ref target="/wiki/Surrealism" title="Surrealism">surrealism</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Symbol" title="Symbol">symbolism</ref> in the realistic framework of a family drama. This platform allows for engaging visceral theatre. Shepard is able to create images in the imaginations of people through the use of surrealism and symbolism, evoke and harness the experiences of his audience through its postmodern nature, and keep the audience comfortable in the trappings of <ref target="/wiki/Realism_(theatre)" title="Realism (theatre)">realism</ref>.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>]</p>
<p>Some critics consider it part of a <ref target="/wiki/Family_Trilogy" title="Family Trilogy">Family Trilogy</ref> which includes <ref target="/wiki/Curse_of_the_Starving_Class" title="Curse of the Starving Class">Curse of the Starving Class</ref> (1976) and <ref target="/wiki/True_West_(play)" title="True West (play)">True West</ref> (1980).<ref target="#cite_note-Simard-2">[2]</ref> Others consider it part of a quintet which includes <ref target="/wiki/Fool_for_Love_(play)" title="Fool for Love (play)">Fool for Love</ref> (1983) and <ref target="/wiki/A_Lie_of_the_Mind" title="A Lie of the Mind">A Lie of the Mind</ref> (1985).<ref target="#cite_note-Roudané-3">[3]</ref></p>

<h3>Style[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Buried_Child&action=edit&section=12" title="Edit section: Style">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Buried Child incorporates many postmodern elements such as the mixing of genres, the <ref target="/wiki/Deconstruction" title="Deconstruction">deconstruction</ref> of a <ref target="/wiki/Metanarrative" title="Metanarrative">grand narrative</ref>, and the use of <ref target="/wiki/Pastiche" title="Pastiche">pastiche</ref> and layering.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>]</p>

<h3>Mixing of genres[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Buried_Child&action=edit&section=13" title="Edit section: Mixing of genres">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Buried Child is laid in the framework of realism; the play is essentially a family drama. However, added into the realistic framework are distinct elements of surrealism and symbolism. The three-act structure, the immediate time frame and the setting of the play in reality give it an overall realistic appearance. Yet the use of symbols such as the corn and the rain give the play a symbolist element while the fragmented characterisation and actions like the multiple burials of Dodge are somewhat surreal or dreamlike. The humour is also an essential element of the style, giving the play sardonic, black and even at times slapstick elements. All these stylistic elements combine to give the play an overall postmodern feel.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>]</p>
