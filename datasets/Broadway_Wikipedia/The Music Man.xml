<ref target="/wiki/Meredith_Willson" title="Meredith Willson">Meredith Willson</ref> was inspired by his boyhood in <ref target="/wiki/Mason_City,_Iowa" title="Mason City, Iowa">Mason City, Iowa</ref>, to write and compose his first musical, The Music Man.<ref target="#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> Willson began developing this theme in his 1948 memoir, And There I Stood With My Piccolo.<ref target="#cite_note-Suskin-3">[3]</ref> He first approached producers <ref target="/wiki/Cy_Feuer" title="Cy Feuer">Cy Feuer</ref> and Ernest Martin for a television special, and then <ref target="/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</ref> producer <ref target="/wiki/Jesse_L._Lasky" title="Jesse L.

After these and other unsuccessful attempts, Willson invited <ref target="/wiki/Franklin_Lacey" title="Franklin Lacey">Franklin Lacey</ref> to help him edit and simplify the libretto. At this time, Willson considered eliminating a long piece of dialogue about the serious trouble facing River City parents. Willson realized it sounded like a lyric, and transformed it into the <ref target="/wiki/Patter_song" title="Patter song">patter song</ref> "<ref target="/wiki/Ya_Got_Trouble" title="Ya Got Trouble">Ya Got Trouble</ref>".<ref target="#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> Willson wrote about his trials and tribulations in getting the show to Broadway in his book But He Doesn't Know the Territory.<ref target="#cite_note-5">[5]</ref>

Robert Preston claimed that he got the role of Harold Hill despite his limited singing range because, when he went to audition, they were having the men sing "Trouble". The producers felt it would be the most difficult song to sing, but with his acting background, it was the easiest for Preston.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>]</p>

<h2>Synopsis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Music_Man&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Synopsis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Act I[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Music_Man&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Act I">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>In the early summer of 1912, aboard a train leaving <ref target="/wiki/Rock_Island,_Illinois" title="Rock Island, Illinois">Rock Island</ref>, Illinois,<ref target="#cite_note-19">[19]</ref> Charlie Cowell and other traveling salesmen argue about consumer credit ("Rock Island"). The conversation turns to another topic: a <ref target="/wiki/Confidence_trick" title="Confidence trick">con man</ref> known as "Professor" Harold Hill, who scams parents by promising to form boys bands, taking payments for instruments and uniforms and skipping town with the money before being exposed. Upon the train‚Äôs arrival in River City, Iowa, a stranger declares, "Gentlemen, you intrigue me. I think I shall have to give Iowa a try." Retrieving his suitcase, labeled "Professor Harold Hill," he exits the train.</p>
<p>After townspeople of River City describe their reserved, "chip-on-the-shoulder attitude" ("<ref target="/wiki/Iowa_Stubborn" title="Iowa Stubborn">Iowa Stubborn</ref>"), Harold sees his old friend and <ref target="/wiki/Shill" title="Shill">shill</ref>, Marcellus Washburn, who has "gone legit" and now lives in the town. Marcellus tells Harold that Marian Paroo, the librarian who gives piano lessons, is the only trained musician in town. He also informs Hill that a new <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pool_table" title="Pool table">pool table</ref> was just delivered to the town's local <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Billiard_parlor" title="Billiard parlor">billiard parlor</ref>, so to launch his scheme, Harold convinces River City parents of the "trouble" that can come from a pool table ("<ref target="/wiki/Ya_Got_Trouble" title="Ya Got Trouble">Ya Got Trouble</ref>"). Harold follows Marian home, attempting to flirt with her, but she ignores him. Marian gives a piano lesson to a little girl named Amaryllis while arguing with her widowed mother about her high "standards where men are concerned"; she mentions the man who followed her home ("Piano Lesson/If You Don't Mind My Saying So"). Marian's self-conscious 10-year-old brother Winthrop arrives home. Amaryllis, who secretly likes Winthrop but teases him about his lisp, asks Marian to whom she should say goodnight on the evening star, since she doesn't have a sweetheart. Marian tells her to just say goodnight to her "someone" ("Goodnight, My Someone").</p>
<p>The next day, Mayor Shinn and his overbearing wife Eulalie MacKecknie Shinn lead the festivities for <ref target="/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)" title="Independence Day (United States)">Independence Day</ref> at the high school gym ("<ref target="/wiki/Columbia,_the_Gem_of_the_Ocean" title="Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean">Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean</ref>") but are interrupted by a firecracker set off by troublemaker Tommy Djilas. Harold takes the stage and announces to the townspeople that he will prevent "sin and corruption" from the pool table by forming a boys' band ("Ya Got Trouble [reprise]/<ref target="/wiki/Seventy-Six_Trombones" title="Seventy-Six Trombones">Seventy-Six Trombones</ref>"). Mayor Shinn, who owns the billiard parlor, tells the bickering school board to get Harold's credentials, but Harold gets them to sing as a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barbershop_Quartet" title="Barbershop Quartet">Barbershop Quartet</ref> to distract them ("Ice Cream/Sincere"). Harold also sets up Zaneeta, the mayor's eldest daughter, with Tommy, and persuades Tommy to work as his assistant. After another rejection by Marian, Harold is determined to win her ("The Sadder But Wiser Girl"). The town ladies are very excited about the band and the ladies' dance committee that Harold plans to form. He mentions Marian, and they imply (falsely, it turns out) that she had an affair with a now-deceased miser, who willed the library building to the town but left all the books to Marian. They warn Harold that she advocates "dirty books" by "<ref target="/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer" title="Geoffrey Chaucer">Chaucer</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Rabelais" title="Fran√ßois Rabelais">Rabelais</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac" title="Honor√© de Balzac">Balzac</ref>" ("Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little"). The school board arrives to review Harold's credentials, but he leads them in song and slips away ("<ref target="/wiki/Goodnight,_Ladies" title="Goodnight, Ladies">Goodnight, Ladies</ref>").</p>
<p>The next day, Harold walks into the library to woo Marian in earnest ("Marian the Librarian"). For a moment, she forgets her decorum and dances with Harold and the teenagers. Harold kisses her; when she tries to slap him, she accidentally hits Tommy instead. With Tommy's help, Harold signs up all the boys in town to be in his band, including Winthrop. Mrs. Paroo likes Harold and tries to find out why Marian is not interested. Marian describes her ideal man ("My White Knight"). She sets out to give Mayor Shinn evidence against Harold that she found in the Indiana State Educational Journal, but they are interrupted by the arrival of the <ref target="/wiki/History_of_Wells_Fargo" title="History of Wells Fargo">Wells Fargo</ref> wagon, which delivers the band instruments ("The Wells Fargo Wagon"). When Winthrop forgets to be shy and self-conscious because he is so happy about his new <ref target="/wiki/Cornet" title="Cornet">cornet</ref>, Marian begins to see Harold in a new light. She tears the incriminating page out of the Journal before giving the book to Mayor Shinn.</p>

<h3>Act II[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Music_Man&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Act II">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The ladies rehearse their classical dance in the school gym while the school board practices their quartet ("It's You") for the <ref target="/wiki/Ice_cream_social" title="Ice cream social">ice cream social</ref>. Marcellus and the town's teenagers interrupt the ladies' practice, taking over the gym as they dance ("<ref target="/wiki/Shipoopi" title="Shipoopi">Shipoopi</ref>"). Harold grabs Marian to dance with her, and all the teenagers join in. Regarding Winthrop's cornet, Marian later questions Harold about his claim that "you don't have to bother with the <ref target="/wiki/Musical_note" title="Musical note">notes</ref>". He explains that this is what he calls "The Think System", and he arranges to call on Marian to discuss it. The town ladies ask Marian to join their dance committee, since she was "so dear dancing the Shipoopi" with Professor Hill ("Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little" [Reprise]). They have reversed their opinions about her books, and they eagerly tell her that "the Professor told us to read those books, and we simply adored them all!"</p>
<p>That night, the school board tries to collect Harold's credentials again, but he gets them to sing again and slips away ("Lida Rose"). Marian, meanwhile, is sitting on her front porch thinking of Harold ("Will I Ever Tell You?"). Winthrop returns home after spending time with Harold and tells Marian and Mrs. Paroo about Harold's hometown ("Gary, Indiana"). As Marian waits alone for Harold, traveling salesman Charlie Cowell enters with evidence against Harold, hoping to tell Mayor Shinn. He only has a few minutes before his train leaves, but stops to flirt with Marian. She delays him so he won't have time to deliver the evidence, eventually kissing him. As the train whistle blows, she pushes him away. Charlie angrily tells Marian that Harold has a girl in "every county in Illinois, and he's taken it from every one of them¬†‚Äì and that's 102 counties!"</p>
<p>Harold arrives, and after he reminds her of the untrue rumors he's heard about her, she convinces herself that Charlie invented everything he told her. They agree to meet at the footbridge, where Marian tells him the difference he's made in her life ("<ref target="/wiki/Till_There_Was_You" title="Till There Was You">Till There Was You</ref>"). Marcellus interrupts and tells Harold that the uniforms have arrived. He urges Harold to take the money and run, but Harold refuses to leave, insisting, "I've come up through the ranks... and I'm not resigning without my commission". He returns to Marian, who tells him that she's known since three days after he arrived that he is a fraud. (Harold earlier claimed to have graduated from the Gary Conservatory in 1905, but Gary, Indiana, was not founded until 1906.) Because she loves him, she gives him the incriminating page out of the Indiana State Educational Journal. She leaves, promising to see him later at the Sociable. With his schemes for the boys' band and Marian proceeding even better than planned, Harold confidently sings "Seventy-Six Trombones". As he overhears Marian singing "Goodnight My Someone", Harold suddenly realizes that he is in love with Marian; he and Marian sing a snatch of each other's songs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Charlie Cowell, who has missed his train, arrives at the ice cream social and denounces Harold Hill as a fraud. The townspeople begin an agitated search for Harold. Winthrop is heartbroken and tells Harold that he wishes Harold never came to River City. But Marian tells Winthrop that she believes everything Harold ever said, for it did come true in the way every kid in town talked and acted that summer. She and Winthrop urge Harold to get away. He chooses to stay and tells Marian that he never really fell in love until he met her ("Till There Was You" [Reprise]). The constable then handcuffs Harold and leads him away.</p>
<p>Mayor Shinn leads a meeting in the high school gym to decide what to do with Harold, asking, "Where's the band? Where's the band?" Marian defends Harold. Tommy enters as a drum major, followed by the kids in uniform with their instruments. Marian urges Harold to lead the River City Boys' Band in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Beethoven" title="Beethoven">Beethoven</ref>'s <ref target="/wiki/Minuet_WoO_10,_No._2_(Beethoven)" title="Minuet WoO 10, No. 2 (Beethoven)">Minuet in G</ref>. Despite the boys' limited musical ability, the parents in the audience are nonetheless enraptured by the sight of their children playing music. Even Mayor Shinn is won over, and, as the townspeople cheer, Harold is released into Marian's arms ("Finale").</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<p>As this musical concerns a <ref target="/wiki/Marching_band" title="Marching band">marching band</ref>, Willson's orchestration for several of the numbers includes band instruments.<ref target="#cite_note-20">[20]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-21">[21]</ref></p>
<p>"Lida Rose" and "Will I Ever Tell You", sung first separately and then simultaneously, are examples of Broadway counterpoint (songs with separate lyrics and separate melodies that harmonize and are designed to be sung together). Similarly, "Pickalittle" and "Good Night Ladies" are also sung first separately, and then in counterpoint. Willson's counterpoint, along with two counterpoint song pairs from <ref target="/wiki/Irving_Berlin" title="Irving Berlin">Irving Berlin</ref> musicals, are lampooned in the 1959 musical <ref target="/wiki/Little_Mary_Sunshine" title="Little Mary Sunshine">Little Mary Sunshine</ref>, where three counterpoint songs are combined: "Playing Croquet," "Swinging" and "How Do You Do?." "Goodnight, My Someone" is the same tune, in waltz time, as the march-tempo "Seventy-six Trombones".<ref target="#cite_note-22">[22]</ref></p>
<p>In the 1962 movie,<ref target="#cite_note-23">[23]</ref> the 1980 and 2000 revivals,<ref target="#cite_note-24">[24]</ref> and some amateur and regional productions, "Gary, Indiana" is sung in Act 1 by Harold (1962 movie) and Mrs. Paroo (between "Marian the Librarian" and "My White Knight"), with Winthrop singing a reprise of it in Act 2 (with Mrs. Paroo and Marian Paroo in 2000).[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>]</p>

<h2>Setting and popular culture references[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Music_Man&action=edit&section=12" title="Edit section: Setting and popular culture references">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The Music Man is set in the fictional town of River City, Iowa, in 1912. The town is based in large part on Willson's birthplace, <ref target="/wiki/Mason_City,_Iowa" title="Mason City, Iowa">Mason City, Iowa</ref>, and many of the musical's characters are based on people that Willson observed in the town.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>].

<h2>Reception[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Music_Man&action=edit&section=15" title="Edit section: Reception">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Though <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/West_Side_Story_(musical)" title="West Side Story (musical)">West Side Story</ref> had opened nearly three months earlier, The Music Man captured audiences, critics and five Tony Awards, including Best Musical. <ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref> theatre critic <ref target="/wiki/Brooks_Atkinson" title="Brooks Atkinson">Brooks Atkinson</ref> wrote in his review "If <ref target="/wiki/Mark_Twain" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</ref> could have collaborated with <ref target="/wiki/Vachel_Lindsay" title="Vachel Lindsay">Vachel Lindsay</ref>, they might have devised a rhythmic lark like The Music Man, which is as American as apple pie and a Fourth of July oration.... The Music Man is a marvelous show, rooted in wholesome and comic tradition."<ref target="#cite_note-34">[34]</ref></p>
<p>Walter Kerr of the <ref target="/wiki/New_York_Herald_Tribune" title="New York Herald Tribune">Herald Tribune</ref> glowingly described the opening scene of the musical: "It's the beat that does it. The overture of The Music Man drives off with a couple of good, shrill whistles and a heave-ho blast from half the brass in the pit, with the heartier trombonists lurching to their feet in a blare of enthusiasm. The curtain sails up to disclose the most energetic engine on the Rock Island Railroad (circa 1912) hurtling across the proscenium with real smoke pouring out of its smokestack and real steam rolling along the rails".<ref target="#cite_note-Suskin-3">[3]</ref> Kerr called Preston "indefatigable: he's got zest and gusto and a great big grin for another slam-bang march tune".<ref target="#cite_note-Suskin-3">[3]</ref> Robert Coleman of the <ref target="/wiki/New_York_Daily_Mirror" title="New York Daily Mirror">New York Daily Mirror</ref> wrote that the producer "made a 10-strike in landing Robert Preston for the title role", stating that Preston "paces the piece dynamically, acts ingratiatingly, sings as if he'd been doing it all his life, and offers steps that would score on the cards of dance judges".<ref target="#cite_note-Suskin-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>Frank Aston of the <ref target="/wiki/New_York_World-Telegram" title="New York World-Telegram">New York World-Telegram and Sun</ref> declared "It deserves to run at least a decade", especially praising Barbara Cook's performance as Marian: "If all our stack-tenders looked, sang, danced, and acted like Miss Barbara, this nation's book learning would be overwhelming".<ref target="#cite_note-Suskin-3">[3]</ref> John Chapman of the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Daily_News_(New_York)" title="Daily News (New York)">Daily News</ref> pronounced The Music Man "one of the few great musical comedies of the last 26 years", stating that <ref target="/wiki/Of_Thee_I_Sing" title="Of Thee I Sing">Of Thee I Sing</ref> (1931) "set a standard for fun and invention which has seldom been reached. Its equal arrived in 1950 ‚Äì <ref target="/wiki/Guys_and_Dolls" title="Guys and Dolls">Guys and Dolls</ref> ‚Äì and I would say that The Music Man ranks with these two".<ref target="#cite_note-Suskin-3">[3]</ref> In the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_York_Journal_American" title="New York Journal American">Journal-American</ref>, John McClain deemed the show "a whopping hit.

<p>The Music Man's popularity has led to its being mentioned, quoted, parodied or pastiched in a number of media, including television, films and popular music.</p>

<h3>Television[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Music_Man&action=edit&section=17" title="Edit section: Television">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The Music Man has been parodied in a number of TV shows, including <ref target="/wiki/The_Simpsons" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</ref> episode "<ref target="/wiki/Marge_vs._the_Monorail" title="Marge vs. the Monorail">Marge vs. the Monorail</ref>", written by <ref target="/wiki/Conan_O%27Brien" title="Conan O'Brien">Conan O'Brien</ref>. At some point during the second Broadway revival, O'Brien was approached about playing the role of Harold Hill for a brief run, but he ultimately could not fit it into his schedule. He says, on the DVD commentary track for the aforementioned Simpsons episode, that it was the hardest choice he's ever had to make professionally, because The Music Man is one of his favorites. O'Brien did, however, as host of the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/58th_Annual_Primetime_Emmy_Awards" title="58th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards">2006 Emmy Awards</ref>, sing a parody version of "Ya Got Trouble" in his opening monologue targeting <ref target="/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</ref> and their slide in the ratings.</p>
<p>The television program <ref target="/wiki/Family_Guy" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</ref> has parodied the musical at least three times. In the episode "<ref target="/wiki/Brian_Wallows_and_Peter%27s_Swallows" title="Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows">Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows</ref>", Lois chastises Brian's high standards in a spoof of "Piano Lesson". In another episode, "<ref target="/wiki/Patriot_Games_(Family_Guy)" title="Patriot Games (Family Guy)">Patriot Games</ref>", Peter showboats after scoring a touchdown by leading a stadium full of people in a rendition of "<ref target="/wiki/Shipoopi" title="Shipoopi">Shipoopi</ref>", complete with choreography from the film. In Episode 22 of <ref target="/wiki/Boston_Legal" title="Boston Legal">Boston Legal</ref>, "Men to Boys", Alan Shore sings a parody of the song "Trouble" to convince patrons of a restaurant not to eat the salmon. Several Music Man songs were used in <ref target="/wiki/Ally_McBeal" title="Ally McBeal">Ally McBeal</ref>, for example in the season 2 episode "Sex, Lies and Politics" in which lawyer <ref target="/wiki/John_Cage_(character)" title="John Cage (character)">John Cage</ref> spurs the jury into singing "Ya Got Trouble" with him.<ref target="#cite_note-35">[35]</ref> Season 2 Episode 15 (2012), "The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000", of the TV show <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_is_Magic" title="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic">My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</ref>, makes numerous allusions to The Music Man, including a song based on "Ya Got Trouble".<ref target="#cite_note-36">[36]</ref></p>
