<h2>Synopsis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Dear_Evan_Hansen&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Synopsis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Act 1[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Dear_Evan_Hansen&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Act 1">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Evan Hansen is a teenager with <ref target="/wiki/Social_anxiety" title="Social anxiety">social anxiety</ref>. His therapist recommends that he write letters to himself detailing what will be good about each day. His mother, Heidi, suggests that he make new friends in senior year at high school by asking people to sign the cast on his arm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the wealthy Murphy family — Cynthia, Larry, and their children Zoe and Connor — Zoe and Larry berate Connor for getting high before school, while Cynthia struggles with the fact that her family is falling apart. The two mothers wonder how to connect with their sons ("Anybody Have a Map?").</p>
<p>At school, Evan meets Alana, a precocious but somewhat self-absorbed classmate, and Jared, his only (family) friend. Both Alana and Jared notice his broken arm, but neither signs his cast. Evan then runs into Connor, who interprets Evan's awkwardness as making fun of him, resulting in Connor's pushing Evan to the ground. Connor's sister Zoe, whom Evan has a crush on, feels obligated to apologize for her brother's behavior. Evan wonders if this is his destiny — to be ignored and an outcast — for the rest of his life ("Waving Through a Window").</p>
<p>Evan writes a letter to himself, wondering whether anyone would notice if he were not there. All his hope is focused on Zoe, since his crush on her is the only thing that brings him happiness ("Waving Through a Window" (Reprise #1)). He encounters Connor again, who now offers to sign Evan's cast. Connor finds Evan's letter on the printer and reads it; he becomes furious at the mention of Zoe, thinking Evan intended for him to see the letter in order to make fun of him. He storms out, taking the letter with him.</p>
<p>Evan is in an intense state of anxiety over what Connor might have done with the letter, and tells Jared online about his assignment to write letters to himself. Evan is called to the principal's office and is told by Connor's parents that Connor died by suicide days before, with Evan's letter found in his pocket, which they believe is a suicide note addressed to him.</p>
<p>Evan goes to Connor's house for dinner. Jared had instructed him to "nod and confirm" to avoid making things worse, but Evan is awkward and uncomfortable and he lies, pretending he and Connor had been best friends, emailing each other from a secret account. The Murphys don't question this because Mr. Murphy had been monitoring Connor's real account. Zoe and Cynthia get into an argument, and Evan jumps in, recounting a fictional version of the day he broke his arm at an abandoned apple orchard the Murphys had visited ("For Forever"). When Evan gets home, Heidi mentions hearing about Connor's death, but Evan tells her not to worry and that he didn't know Connor. After realizing he needs evidence of his supposed "secret email account", Evan enlists Jared's help in creating fake, backdated email conversations between himself and Connor ("Sincerely, Me").</p>
<p>After Evan shows the Murphy family Connor's "emails", Cynthia is ecstatic that her son had a friend, but Larry is hurt that Connor took his family and his privileged life for granted. Cynthia tries to show Zoe the emails, but they argue again. Zoe still refuses to mourn Connor ("Requiem"). Despite this, after reading the "suicide note", Zoe notices that she is mentioned and asks Evan why Connor would say that about her. Evan, unable to tell her the truth, tells her all the reasons he loves her under the guise of Connor saying them ("If I Could Tell Her"). Overcome with emotion, he impulsively kisses Zoe, but she pulls away and tells him to leave.</p>
<p>At school, Evan and Alana notice that people are starting to forget about Connor, so Evan enlists Alana and Jared's help in founding "The Connor Project" to keep Connor's memory alive. The three pitch the idea to the Murphys, who agree to support the project ("Disappear"). Moved by his dedication, Cynthia gives Evan a necktie she had gotten for Connor that he had never worn and asks Evan to wear it when he speaks at Connor's memorial service. At the official launch of The Connor Project, Evan gives an inspiring speech about his loneliness and friendship with Connor, which goes viral. Zoe, overcome by the impact her brother and Evan have had, kisses him ("You Will Be Found").</p>

<h3>Act 2[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Dear_Evan_Hansen&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Act 2">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Evan and Alana pitch a fundraising idea on The Connor Project's website, to raise $50,000 to reopen the abandoned apple orchard where Evan and Connor ‘supposedly’ spent time. However, Evan becomes preoccupied with his new relationship with Zoe and his newfound family in the Murphys, and begins to neglect his mother, Jared, and The Connor Project ("Sincerely, Me" (Reprise)).</p>
<p>Heidi asks Evan why he did not tell her about The Connor Project or about his friendship with Connor. He angrily responds that he did not have the time because she is never around. Overcome with emotion, he rushes off to the Murphys, where Evan bonds with Larry Murphy and confides in him about his childhood. Larry offers him an old baseball glove of Connor's that was never used. ("To Break in a Glove"). Later, when Evan begins to mention Connor, Zoe tells him that she does not want their relationship to be about Connor, but about the two of them ("Only Us").</p>
<p>Evan goes to the Murphys, only to discover they invited Heidi for dinner. She is mortified to learn they want to give Evan Connor's college fund. At home, Heidi and Evan fight over his secrecy and deception, with Evan confessing that he feels welcomed and accepted into the Murphy family because of Heidi's absence. Meanwhile, Alana begins to find inconsistencies in the fake emails. Evan asks Jared to help fix the inaccuracies, but Jared refuses and threatens to expose Evan, who counters that he could expose Jared's role. Heidi, Alana, and Jared converge in Evan's conscience, compounding his guilt and doubt over his decisions ("Good for You").</p>
<p>Evan decides he has to confess to what he has done. Imaginary Connor attempts to talk him out of it, but Evan shouts that he needs the whole thing to be over. Connor tells him that if he tells the truth, all he has will be gone, and the only thing he will be left with is himself ("For Forever" (Reprise)). He disappears, leaving Evan alone.</p>
<p>Evan apologizes to Alana, but she has given up on Evan's help with The Connor Project as she doubts the truth of his statements that he was Connor's best friend. Evan shows her the letter to himself that he wrote when he was giving up on having a good year, claiming it to be Connor's suicide note. Realizing that the letter is the key to fulfilling the fundraising goal, Alana posts it online where, to Evan's chagrin, it goes viral. As a result, many people begin to believe Connor's suicide was because of his uncaring, wealthy parents ("You Will Be Found" (Reprise)).</p>
<p>The Murphys have become the targets of hateful comments because people believe they were responsible for Connor's death. Evan, distraught, walks in on the Murphys fighting about why Connor really killed himself. Evan admits his fabrication, hopeful that he could forge a genuine bond with the Murphys out of the tragedy. As Zoe and her mother tearfully leave, Larry turns away from Evan in disgust. Alone once more, Evan absorbs his perceived brokenness as inescapable ("Words Fail").</p>
<p>Heidi saw the letter online and knew that it was one of Evan's therapy assignments. She apologizes to Evan for not seeing how badly he had been hurting, though Evan denies her guilt due to his deception. He vaguely admits that his fall from the tree was a suicide attempt. Heidi recalls the day that his father moved out and did not know how she was going to make it by herself. In the end, she realized that she was not alone – she had Evan and knew that the two of them could survive anything so long as they were together. Tearfully, Heidi promises that she will always be there for him when he needs her ("So Big/So Small").</p>
<p>A year later, Evan is still living at home and working at Pottery Barn to earn enough money to go to college the next semester. He contacts Zoe, whom he has not seen since she found out the truth, and asks her to meet him. She insists that they meet at the orchard that has been reopened in Connor's memory. He apologizes for the pain he caused by manipulating her family and admits that he has been reading Connor's ten favorite books in an attempt to connect with who he really was. He thanks her and her parents for keeping his secret and reveals that they never told anyone else that his friendship with Connor was a lie. She forgives him, saying the ordeal brought her family closer together because "everyone needed it for something." Evan asks her why she insisted on meeting at the orchard, and she replies that she wanted to be sure he saw it, and the two share a gentle moment before they part. Evan mentally writes himself one last letter reflecting on the impact he has had on his community and finally accepts himself ("Finale").</p>

<h3>Characters[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Dear_Evan_Hansen&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Evan Hansen – A high school senior. He is assigned by his therapist to write letters to himself about why each day will be good, which becomes the catalyst for the plot of the story (hence the name, Dear Evan Hansen). He has never had any friends, and has had a crush on Zoe Murphy for a very long time. After Connor's death, he begins to tell lies of his being friends with Connor to the Murphy family because they found Evan's letter to himself folded up in Connor's pocket; they thought Connor wrote it to Evan. The first act centers on his outreach propelled by Connor's death, while the second act has him unleash his yearning towards the Murphys and his anger towards Heidi and Jared, who he believes have used him for validation and ignored him when they didn't need him.</p>
<p>Heidi Hansen – Evan's mother, a nurse's aide who attends paralegal school at night, often leaving Evan on his own as a result. She tries to connect with Evan, but struggles because she doesn't personally understand what he goes through on a daily basis. Having been left by her ex-husband years prior to raise Evan on her own, she exhibits possessive and jealous behavior once she learns of the Murphys' interest in securing Evan's future. However, she comes to see her failings and Evan's concealed sorrow as a wake-up-call not to hide from her son.</p>
<p>Zoe Murphy – Connor's younger sister and Evan's longtime crush. She was never close to Connor, even hated him and thought he was a monster, but wishes she had known him better and turns to Evan after he lies and says he was friends with Connor. She is initially mad at Evan when he comes clean about the lies, but eventually forgives him a year later.</p>
<p>Cynthia Murphy – Connor and Zoe's stay-at-home mother. She is constantly trying to keep her fragile family from falling apart, but is often unsuccessful. She did all that she could to keep the family together and make Connor happy, but with Larry's controlling personality, it was rather difficult. The second act elaborates on her past attempts at coaxing Connor through expensive retreats, and her bitterness towards her husband's distance.</p>
<p>Larry Murphy – Connor and Zoe's busy and distant father. He chooses to do things the hard way, because he believes it's the "right way" throughout the musical, which turns out is just the wrong thing. It only ends up hurting Connor, resulting in strain in the entire family. He seemed to also be very controlling towards his own wife, Cynthia Murphy. Larry displays fatherlike behavior towards Evan once he comes into their lives, often saying that he was better than Connor, and that Evan is "the son he never had".</p>
<p>Connor Murphy – A high school senior who, like Evan, is also a social outcast with no friends. He is a frequent drug user, getting high to cope with his aggressive and violent tendencies. He has a strained relationship with his sister, Zoe, who notes that Connor had threatened her life multiple times. He commits suicide early on, but his image returns in Evan's imagination to guide him. Evan's imaginary version of Connor is likable, contributing to Evan's belief that they could have been friends. His death is the basis of the whole story.</p>
<p>Alana Beck – Evan's precocious and sometimes insufferable classmate. She is constantly looking for academic and extracurricular activities to boost her collegiate chances. As Alana has it, "Connor was one of my closest acquaintances", but is greatly affected by his death and the concept of mortality, and quickly joins Evan in founding the Connor Project in order to keep Connor's memory alive.</p>
<p>Jared Kleinman – Evan's so-called "family friend." Although Jared presents himself as an arrogant jerk, he is actually a very insecure teenage boy underneath his facade, and helps with the Connor Project as well.</p>

<h2>Critical response[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Dear_Evan_Hansen&action=edit&section=19" title="Edit section: Critical response">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The musical has received critical acclaim, particularly for Ben Platt's leading performance, the lyrics, and the book. The story has also provided and encouraged open dialogue about its themes of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mental_illness" title="Mental illness">mental illness</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Youth_suicide" title="Youth suicide">youth suicide</ref>. Dear Evan Hansen is a recipient of the 2015 Edgerton Foundation New Play Award.<ref target="#cite_note-39">[39]</ref></p>
<p>Derek Mong, in his review of the musical at the Arena Stage, wrote that the "inventive set design by David Korins...that transforms a small stage into a platform for the most intimate living room where a mother and son share a heart-to-heart to the physical abyss of internet cyberspace... book by Steven Levenson... lyrics and music by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul... heartfelt lyrics with universal appeal joined by the perfect, oftentimes acoustic, accompaniment that can change the mood from somber to celebratory to sinister in a single bar of music."<ref target="#cite_note-40">[40]</ref> Barbara Mackay in reviewing the Arena Stage production for TheatreMania wrote: "Levenson, Pasek, and Paul set themselves two high, untraditional bars in Evan Hansen: exploring a community's grief and examining a lonely protagonist who desperately wants to connect with that community... Ben Platt is outstanding as Evan... Since the success of the musical depends entirely on whether Evan's solitary nature appears funny or weird, Evan's ability to laugh at himself and make the audience laugh is crucial. Platt is charming as he eternally twists his shirt tails and hangs his head... Although the themes of grief and loneliness are serious, the musical is anything but somber. It addresses challenging facts of life. But from start to finish, when Evan leaves his room and finds an authentic life outside it, Dear Evan Hansen contains far more joy than sadness."<ref target="#cite_note-41">[41]</ref></p>
<ref target="/wiki/Charles_Isherwood" title="Charles Isherwood">Charles Isherwood</ref>, in his review of the Second Stage production for <ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref>, noted: "The songs, by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (Dogfight, A Christmas Story), strike the same complex notes, with shapely, heartfelt lyrics that expose the tensions and conflicts that Connor’s death and Evan’s involvement cause in both families. The music, played by a small but excellent band on a platform upstage, is appealingly unstrident pop-rock, with generous doses of acoustic guitar, keyboards and strings. It's the finest, most emotionally resonant score yet from this promising young songwriting team."<ref target="#cite_note-42">[42]</ref> Susan Davidson, in her review of the Arena Stage production for CurtainUp, noted: "it helps to suspend the disbelief that sullen, anti-social teenagers can change quickly. Surely that's a process requiring time-released hormonal adjustments. It is hard to accept that a long-admired-from-afar girl can change Evan's outlook on life so rapidly or that Connor's teenage disequilibrium leads him to do what he does. Coming through loud and clear, however, is the fact that what starts as deceit can be blown totally out of proportion by the Internet where lies are disseminated with lightning speed leaving plenty of victims in their wake [...] The music is pleasant, not terribly original but good enough to get toes tapping. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul's ballads stand out, particularly Heidi's 'So Big/So Small,' Evan's 'Words Fail' and Zoe and Evan's young sweethearts duet 'Only Us.'"<ref target="#cite_note-43">[43]</ref>
<p>Despite widespread acclaim for the show, its story and music, the overall public reception was not without its criticism. Some reviews of the show claim that it romanticizes and sanitizes mental illness by not mentioning the name of the diagnosis Evan has (many claim it to be <ref target="/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder" title="Social anxiety disorder">social anxiety disorder</ref> with features of <ref target="/wiki/Asperger_syndrome" title="Asperger syndrome">Asperger syndrome</ref>) and glorifies suicide, leaving many to question how Connor kills himself and if Evan's suicide attempt was truly intentional (even Stacey Mindich, lead producer of the original Broadway production, claimed that she and the team did not want the show to be called a "suicide musical" in order to gain an audience).</p>
<ref target="/wiki/Jason_Zinoman" title="Jason Zinoman">Jason Zinoman</ref> in a piece for <ref target="/wiki/Slate_(magazine)" title="Slate (magazine)">Slate</ref> argues that the musical "employs many different tactics to prevent us from seeing Evan Hansen as a jerk, but its most audacious is to not allow anyone onstage to see him that way...The choice to give Evan Hansen no comeuppance doesn’t make dramatic sense. But you don’t need to be too cynical to see its commercial and emotional logic. Not giving voice to anger at Evan Hansen avoids the more unpleasant ramifications of his exploitation of a tragedy for his own personal gain, which might complicate the audience’s reaction to him. Evan Hansen isn’t as interested in these themes as it is in keeping the focus on the insecurity of the outsider, the nerd, the teenager yearning for acceptance. (To be fair, it is also interested in Evan’s mother, who has one of the most moving songs in the show.)"<ref target="#cite_note-44">[44]</ref>
<p>Hilton Als of <ref target="/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</ref> was also critical, writing "It would have been amazing if Levenson had continued to dig into Evan’s awfulness. Instead, he takes side trips into tired knee-jerk liberalism and therapeutic healing. (One of the more uncomfortable moments in the show is when Alana, a black character, played by Kristolyn Lloyd as a P.C. bully, screams about her invisibility. Levenson and the others are trying to keep up with the times and diversify, but why does it have to feel so forced and tired?) Evan confesses his deceit and makes it clear that all he wanted, really, was to be loved, because of, well, that absent daddy, that inattentive mommy, and the nastiness of the world. With that false move, the show’s creators risk destroying what’s so spikily fascinating about Evan. Still, until the second act, and despite it, Platt gives a performance that binds us to him in the way that Holden Caulfield, that other teen with a voice, did—especially when he said, 'It’s funny. Don’t ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody.'"<ref target="#cite_note-45">[45]</ref></p>
