<h2>Early life[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Legs_Diamond&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Diamond was born July 10, 1897, to Sara and John Diamond, who emigrated from <ref target="/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</ref> in 1891 to <ref target="/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</ref>, USA. In 1899, Jack's younger brother Eddie Diamond was born. Jack and Eddie both struggled through grade school, while Sara suffered from severe <ref target="/wiki/Arthritis" title="Arthritis">arthritis</ref> and other health issues. On December 24, 1913, Sara died from complications due to a bacterial infection and high fever. John Diamond, Sr. moved to <ref target="/wiki/Brooklyn" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</ref> shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>Diamond soon joined a New York street gang called the <ref target="/wiki/Hudson_Dusters" title="Hudson Dusters">Hudson Dusters</ref>. Diamond's first arrest for burglary occurred when he broke into a jewelry store on February 4, 1914, with numerous arrests following throughout the rest of his life. Diamond served in the U.S. Army during <ref target="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</ref>, but deserted in 1918 or 1919, then was convicted and jailed for desertion.</p>
<p>Once free of jail, Diamond became a thug and later personal bodyguard for Arnold Rothstein in 1919.<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>On October 16, 1927 Diamond tried to stop the murder of "Little Augie" (<ref target="/wiki/Jacob_Orgen" title="Jacob Orgen">Jacob Orgen</ref>). Diamond's brother Eddie was Orgen's bodyguard, but Legs Diamond substituted for Eddie that day. As Orgen and Diamond were walking down a street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, three young men approached them and started shooting. Orgen was fatally wounded and Diamond was shot two times below the heart. Diamond was taken to <ref target="/wiki/Bellevue_Hospital" title="Bellevue Hospital">Bellevue Hospital</ref>, where he eventually recovered.<ref target="#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> The police interviewed Diamond in the hospital, but he refused to identify any suspects or help the investigation in any way. The police initially suspected that Diamond was an accomplice and charged him with homicide, but the charge was later dropped.<ref target="#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> The assailants were supposedly hired by <ref target="/wiki/Louis_Buchalter" title="Louis Buchalter">Louis Buchalter</ref> and <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gurrah_Shapiro" title="Gurrah Shapiro">Gurrah Shapiro</ref>, who were seeking to move in on Orgen's garment district labor rackets.</p>

<h2>Lifestyle[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Legs_Diamond&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Lifestyle">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Diamond was known for leading a rather flamboyant lifestyle. He was a very energetic individual; his nickname "Legs" derived either from his being a good dancer or from how fast he could escape his enemies. His wife Alice was never supportive of his lifestyle, but did not do much to dissuade him from it. Diamond was a womanizer; his best known mistress was showgirl and dancer Marion "Kiki" Roberts. The public loved Diamond; he was <ref target="/wiki/Upstate_New_York" title="Upstate New York">Upstate New York's</ref> biggest celebrity at the time.</p>

<h2>Prohibition and the Manhattan Bootleg Wars[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Legs_Diamond&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Prohibition and the Manhattan Bootleg Wars">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>During the late 1920s, <ref target="/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States" title="Prohibition in the United States">Prohibition</ref> was in force, and the sale of beer and other alcohol was illegal in the United States. Diamond traveled to <ref target="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</ref> to score beer and narcotics, but failed. He did obtain liquor, which was dumped overboard in partially full barrels, which floated onto Long Island, as ships entered New York. He paid the children a nickel for every barrel they brought to his trucks.</p>
<p>Following Orgen's death, Diamond went to work overseeing bootleg alcohol sales in downtown <ref target="/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</ref>. That brought him into conflict with Dutch Schultz, who wanted to move beyond his base in <ref target="/wiki/Harlem" title="Harlem">Harlem</ref>. He also ran into trouble with other gangs in the city.</p>
<p>In 1930, Diamond and two henchmen kidnapped <ref class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Grover_Parks&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Grover Parks (page does not exist)">Grover Parks</ref>, a truck driver in <ref target="/wiki/Cairo,_New_York" title="Cairo, New York">Cairo, New York</ref>, and demanded to know where he had obtained his load of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hard_cider" title="Hard cider">hard cider</ref>. When Parks denied carrying anything, Diamond and his men beat and tortured Parks, eventually letting him go. A few months later, Diamond was charged with the kidnapping of James Duncan. He was sent to <ref target="/wiki/Catskill_(town),_New_York" title="Catskill (town), New York">Catskill, New York</ref>, for his first trial, but was acquitted. However, he was convicted in a federal case on related charges, and sentenced to four years in jail. In a third trial, in <ref target="/wiki/Troy,_New_York" title="Troy, New York">Troy, New York</ref>, he was acquitted.</p>

<h2>Trip to Europe[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Legs_Diamond&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Trip to Europe">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>In late August, 1930, Diamond boarded the <ref target="/wiki/Ocean_liner" title="Ocean liner">ocean liner</ref> <ref target="/wiki/SS_Belgenland_(1914)" title="SS Belgenland (1914)">Belgenland</ref> in New York for a voyage to <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Antwerp,_Belgium" title="Antwerp, Belgium">Antwerp, Belgium</ref>. He told reporters that his final destination was <ref target="/wiki/Vichy" title="Vichy">Vichy</ref> in France, where he would take a "cure" of the mineral waters for his health. However, the real reason was to look for sources of <ref target="/wiki/Rye_whiskey" title="Rye whiskey">rye whiskey</ref> in Germany to illegally import into the United States. During the trip, Diamond allegedly won several thousand dollars in poker games with other passengers, who treated him like a celebrity.<ref target="#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> However, as soon as Diamond left the Belgenland, he was taken by Antwerp police to their headquarters. At the end of the day, Diamond agreed to voluntarily leave the country and was put on a train to Germany.</p>
<p>When Diamond's train reached the town of <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aix-la-Chapelle" title="Aix-la-Chapelle">Aix-la-Chapelle</ref> (now Aachen) in Germany, agents of the German secret service arrested him.<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> On September 6, the German government decided to deport Diamond. He was driven to <ref target="/wiki/Hamburg" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</ref> and placed on the freighter Hannover for passage to <ref target="/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> On September 23, the Hannover arrived in Philadelphia and Diamond was immediately arrested by <ref target="/wiki/Philadelphia_Police_Department" title="Philadelphia Police Department">Philadelphia Police Department</ref> officers. At a court hearing that day, the judge said he would release Diamond if he left Philadelphia within the hour. Diamond agreed.<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref></p>

<h2>Assassination and prosecution attempts[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Legs_Diamond&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Assassination and prosecution attempts">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>On October 12, 1930, Diamond was shot and wounded at the Hotel Monticello on the west side of Manhattan. Two men forced their way into Diamond's room and shot him five times before fleeing. Still in his pajamas, Diamond staggered into the hallway and collapsed. When asked later by the New York Police Commissioner how he managed to walk out of the room, Diamond said he drank two shots of whiskey first. Diamond was rushed to the Polyclinic Hospital in Manhattan, where he eventually recovered.<ref target="#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> On December 30, 1930, Diamond was discharged from Polyclinic.<ref target="#cite_note-diamond_case-11">[11]</ref></p>
<p>On April 21, 1931, Diamond was arrested in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catskill,_New_York" title="Catskill, New York">Catskill, New York</ref>, on assault charges for the Parks beating in 1930. Two days later, he was released from the county jail on $25,000 bond.<ref target="#cite_note-12">[12]</ref></p>
<p>On April 27, 1931, Diamond was again shot and wounded, this time at the Aratoga Inn, a <ref target="/wiki/Roadhouse_(facility)" title="Roadhouse (facility)">road house</ref> near <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cairo_(town),_New_York" title="Cairo (town), New York">Cairo, New York</ref>. After eating in the dining room with three companions, Diamond walked out to the front door. He was shot three times, and collapsed by the door. A local resident drove Diamond to a hospital in <ref target="/wiki/Albany,_New_York" title="Albany, New York">Albany, New York</ref>, where he eventually recovered.<ref target="#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> On May 1, while Diamond was still in the hospital, New York State Troopers seized over $5,000 worth of illegal beer and alcohol from Diamond's hiding places in Cairo and at the Aratoga Inn.<ref target="#cite_note-14">[14]</ref></p>
<p>In August 1931, Diamond and Paul Quattrocchi went on trial for <ref target="/wiki/Rum-running" title="Rum-running">bootlegging</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-diamond_case-11">[11]</ref> That same month, Diamond was convicted and sentenced to four years in state prison. In September 1931, Diamond appealed his conviction.<ref target="#cite_note-15">[15]</ref></p>

<h2>Death[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Legs_Diamond&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Death">edit</ref>]</h2>
<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:House_at_67_Dove_Street,_Albany,_NY.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:House_at_67_Dove_Street,_Albany,_NY.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>House at 67 Dove Street, where Diamond was murdered in 1931
<p>On December 18, 1931, Diamond's enemies finally caught up with him. Diamond had been staying in a <ref target="/wiki/Rooming_house" title="Rooming house">rooming house</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/Albany,_New_York" title="Albany, New York">Albany, New York</ref> while on trial in <ref target="/wiki/Troy,_New_York" title="Troy, New York">Troy, New York</ref>, on kidnapping charges. On December 17, Diamond was acquitted. That night, Diamond, his family and friends were at a restaurant. At 1:00 a.m., Diamond went to visit his mistress, Marion "Kiki" Roberts. At 4:30 a.m., Diamond went back to the rooming house and passed out on his bed. Two gunmen entered his room around an hour later. One man held down Diamond while the other shot him three times in the back of the head.<ref target="#cite_note-16">[16]</ref></p>
<p>There has been much speculation as to who was responsible for the murder; likely candidates include <ref target="/wiki/Dutch_Schultz" title="Dutch Schultz">Dutch Schultz</ref>, the Oley Brothers (local thugs), the Albany Police Department, and relatives of Red Cassidy, another Irish American gangster at the time. According to <ref target="/wiki/William_Kennedy_(author)" title="William Kennedy (author)">William Kennedy</ref>'s O Albany, Democratic Party Chairman <ref target="/wiki/Daniel_P._O%27Connell" title="Daniel P. O'Connell">Dan O'Connell</ref>, who ran the local political machine, ordered Diamond's execution, which was carried out by the Albany Police. The following are Dan O'Connell's own words recorded during a 1974 interview by Kennedy and appear on pages 203 and 204:</p>

<p>In order for the Mafia to move in they had to have protection, and they know they'll never get it in this town. We settled that years ago. Legs Diamond [...] called up one day and said he wanted to go into the 'insurance' business here. He was going to sell strong-arm 'protection' to the merchants. I sent word to him that he wasn't going to do any business in Albany and we didn't expect to see him in town the next morning. He never started anything here.</p>
<p>Prior brought him around here [...] but brought him around once too often. Fitzpatrick finished Legs.</p>

<p>O'Connell added that William Fitzpatrick (a police sergeant at the time and later chief) and Diamond were "sitting in the same room and (Fitzpatrick) followed him out. Fitzpatrick told him he'd kill him if he didn't keep going.</p>
<p>Given the power that the O'Connell <ref target="/wiki/Political_machine" title="Political machine">machine</ref> held in Albany and their determination to prevent organized crime, other than their own, from establishing itself in the city and threatening their monopoly of vice, most people accept this account of the story. In addition, it has been confirmed by other former machine officials. Fitzpatrick's promotion to Chief of Police was believed to have been a reward for executing Diamond. In 1945, Chief Fitzpatrick himself was shot and killed in his own office by an Albany police detective, John McElveney. Detective McElveney was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. He was released in 1957, when his sentence was commuted by Governor <ref target="/wiki/W._Averell_Harriman" title="W. Averell Harriman">W. Averell Harriman</ref>.</p>
<p>On December 23, 1931, Jack Diamond was buried at Mt Olivet Cemetery in <ref target="/wiki/Maspeth,_Queens" title="Maspeth, Queens">Maspeth, Queens</ref>. There was no church service or graveside ceremony. Two hundred family and spectators attended Diamond's <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Interment" title="Interment">interment</ref>; no criminal figures were spotted.<ref target="#cite_note-17">[17]</ref></p>
<p>On July 1, 1933, Diamond's widow, Alice Kenny Diamond, was found shot to death in her Brooklyn apartment. It was speculated that she was shot by Diamond's enemies to keep her quiet.<ref target="#cite_note-18">[18]</ref></p>
