<h2>Plot summary[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Dreamgirls&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Plot summary">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Act I: 1960s</p>
<p>In 1962, The Dreamettes, a hopeful black <ref target="/wiki/Girl_group" title="Girl group">girl group</ref> from <ref target="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</ref>, enter the famous Amateur Night talent competition at the <ref target="/wiki/Apollo_Theater" title="Apollo Theater">Apollo Theater</ref> in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Harlem,_New_York" title="Harlem, New York">Harlem, New York</ref> ("I'm Lookin' for Something", "Goin' Downtown", "Takin' the Long Way Home"). The group is composed conducted of full-figured lead singer Effie White and best friends, Deena Jones and Lorrell Robinson. For the contest, the Dreamettes sing "Move (You're Steppin' on My Heart)", a song written by Effie's brother, C.C., who accompanies them to the talent show. Unfortunately, they lose the talent show, but backstage, the girls and C.C. meet Curtis Taylor, Jr., a car salesman who becomes the Dreamettes' manager.</p>
<p>Curtis convinces James "Thunder" Early, a popular R&B star, and his manager, Marty, to hire The Dreamettes as backup singers. Though Jimmy Early and the Dreamettes' first performance together is successful ("Fake Your Way to the Top"), Jimmy is desperate for new material. Curtis convinces Jimmy and Marty that they should venture beyond traditional rhythm and blues and <ref target="/wiki/Soul_music" title="Soul music">soul</ref> audiences and aim for the pop market. C.C. composes "Cadillac Car" for Jimmy and the Dreamettes, who tour ("Cadillac Car (On the Road)") and record the single upon their return ("Cadillac Car (In the Recording Studio)"). "Cadillac Car" makes its way up the pop charts, but a cover version by white pop singers Dave and the Sweethearts ("Cadillac Car" (Reprise)) steals the original recording's thunder. Angered by "Cadillac Car's" usurpation, Curtis, C.C., and Jimmy's producer, Wayne, resort to <ref target="/wiki/Payola" title="Payola">payola</ref>, bribing disc jockeys across the nation to play Jimmy Early and the Dreamettes' next single, "Steppin' to the Bad Side". As a result, the record becomes a major pop hit. Conflict arises between Marty and Curtis when Curtis moves in on Marty's turf: Jimmy Early. Things become more complicated when Effie begins dating Curtis, and Jimmy, a married man, begins an affair with Lorrell ("Party, Party").</p>
<p>Curtis replaces him, strongly determined to make his black singers household names. Curtis attempts to transform Jimmy Early into a <ref target="/wiki/Perry_Como" title="Perry Como">Perry Como</ref>-esque pop singer ("I Want You Baby"), and concentrates on establishing the Dreamettes as their own act, renaming them The Dreams, changing their act to give them a more sophisticated and pop-friendly look and sound. The most crucial of these changes is the establishment of Deena as lead singer, instead of Effie. Effie is resentful of her change in status within the group. C.C. convinces her to go along with Curtis's plan ("Family"). After a fight between Marty and Curtis, Marty quits as Jimmy's manager and Curtis takes over. The Dreams make their club debut in the Crystal Room in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cleveland,_Ohio" title="Cleveland, Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</ref>, singing their first single ("Dreamgirls"). After a triumphant show, the press is eager to meet the newly minted stars ("Press Conference"). Curtis declares to Deena, "I'm going to make you the most famous woman who's ever lived," as the slighted Effie asks "What about me?" ("Only the Beginning"). Over the next few years, the Dreams become a mainstream success with hit singles ("Heavy"). As Deena is increasingly feted as a star, Effie becomes temperamental and unpredictable. She suspects Curtis and Deena of having an affair. Lorrell attempts to keep peace between her bandmates, but the task seems difficult.</p>
<p>In 1967, the group – now known as "Deena Jones and the Dreams" – is set to make their <ref target="/wiki/Las_Vegas_Strip" title="Las Vegas Strip">Las Vegas</ref> début. However, when Jimmy stops by to visit the girls ("Drivin' Down the Strip"), he learns from the others that Effie has been missing shows because of illness (it is later revealed that she was pregnant with Curtis's child). Curtis and Deena are convinced that she is trying to sabotage the act. Curtis replaces Effie with a new singer, Jackie Morris, a young girlfriend change about which Effie learns before anyone has a chance to tell her. Effie confronts Curtis, C.C., and the group ("It's All Over"), but despite her personal appeal to Curtis ("<ref target="/wiki/And_I_Am_Telling_You_I%27m_Not_Going" title="And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going">And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going</ref>"), the heartbroken Effie is left behind as Deena Jones and the Dreams forge ahead without her ("Love Love Me Baby").</p>
<p>Act II: 1970s</p>
<p>By 1972, Deena Jones and the Dreams have become the most successful girl group in the country ("Act II Opening"1). Deena has married Curtis, and C.C. is in love with Jackie. Jimmy has gone years without a hit. Curtis shows little interest in updating or revitalizing Jimmy's act because of Curtis's preoccupation with Deena and because of Jimmy's habit of sneaking <ref target="/wiki/Funk" title="Funk">funk</ref> numbers into his repertoire of pop-friendly songs. Effie is back in Chicago, a single mother to her daughter, Magic (or Ronald in other versions), struggling to get another break. Marty, who is now her manager, compels her to rebuild her confidence and give up her "diva behaviors." Once she does, Effie is able to make a show business comeback ("<ref target="/wiki/I_Am_Changing" title="I Am Changing">I Am Changing</ref>"). In contrast to Effie's struggling return to her musical career, Deena wants to stop singing and become an actress. Deena informs Curtis of her career plans during a <ref target="/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)" title="Vogue (magazine)">Vogue</ref> photo shoot ("One More Picture Please"), but Curtis refuses to let her go ("When I First Saw You"). Deena is not the only one chafing under Curtis's control: C.C. is enraged by Curtis's constant rearrangements of his songs, including an emotional ballad, entitled "One Night Only", which Curtis wants instead recorded to reflect the "<ref target="/wiki/Disco" title="Disco">new sound</ref>" he is inventing.</p>
<p>Deena Jones and the Dreams and Jimmy Early perform at a National Democratic fundraiser, on a bill featuring such groups as The Five Tuxedos ("Got to Be Good Times"). While waiting backstage to go on, Jimmy finds himself in another argument with Lorrell as to the nature of their relationship and when, or if, Jimmy will tell his wife about their affair ("Ain't No Party"). Lorrell is in tears as Jimmy takes to the stage to perform, and turns to Deena for support. As Jimmy pleads to Lorrell through his music ("I Meant You No Harm"), Deena tries to help Lorrell successfully resolve her situation, and Jackie convinces the artisticallray frustrated C.C. to go find his sister and reconcile with her ("Quintette"). Midway through "I Meant You No Harm", Jimmy falls apart and decides that he "can't sing any more sad songs." Desperate to keep his set going, Jimmy launches into a wild, improvised funk number ("The Rap"), dropping his pants during the performance. An embarrassed Curtis fires Jimmy as soon as his set concludes ("Firing of Jimmy"). Lorrell ends her affair with Jimmy as well. The heartbroken Jimmy fades into obscurity, refusing to "beg" for Curtis' help.</p>
<p>Marty arranges for C.C. to meet and reconcile with Effie at a recording studio ("I Miss You, Old Friend"). C.C. apologizes for his role in handicapping her career, and Effie records C.C.'s "<ref target="/wiki/One_Night_Only_(song)" title="One Night Only (song)">One Night Only</ref>" in its original ballad format. "One Night Only" begins climbing the charts, causing an enraged Curtis not only to rush-release Deena and the Dreams' version, but to use massive amounts of payola to push Deena's version up the charts and Effie's version down ("One Night Only (Disco)"). Effie, C.C., and Marty discover Curtis's scheme and confront him backstage at a Dreams concert, threatening legal action ("I'm Somebody", "Chicago/Faith in Myself"). As Curtis makes arrangements with Effie's lawyer to reverse his wrongdoings, Effie and Deena reconcile, and Deena learns that Effie's daughter Magic is Curtis's child. Realizing what kind of a man Curtis really is, Deena finally finds the courage to leave him and live her own life ("Listen" 2). Effie's "One Night Only" becomes a number-one hit, as the Dreams break up so that Deena can pursue her movie career ("Hard to Say Goodbye, My Love"). For the final number of the Dreams' farewell concert, Effie rejoins the group on stage, and all four Dreams sing their signature song one last time ("Dreamgirls (Reprise)").</p>

<h2>Original Broadway production[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Dreamgirls&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Original Broadway production">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Background[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Dreamgirls&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Background">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Dreamgirls had its beginnings as a project for <ref target="/wiki/Nell_Carter" title="Nell Carter">Nell Carter</ref>. Playwright Tom Eyen and conductor Henry Krieger first worked together on the 1975 musical version of Eyen's play The Dirtiest Show in Town. Carter appeared in the musical, and her performance inspired Eyen and Krieger to craft a musical about black back-up singers, which was originally called One Night Only and then given the working title of Project #9.<ref target="#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> Project #9 was workshopped for <ref target="/wiki/Joseph_Papp" title="Joseph Papp">Joseph Papp</ref>; Nell Carter was joined at this time by Sheryl Lee Ralph and Loretta Devine, who were to play her groupmates. The project was shelved after Carter departed to appear in the <ref target="/wiki/Soap_opera" title="Soap opera">soap opera</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Ryan%27s_Hope" title="Ryan's Hope">Ryan's Hope</ref> in 1978.</p>
<p>A year later, Project #9 was brought back to the table, after catching the interest of <ref target="/wiki/Michael_Bennett_(theater)" title="Michael Bennett (theater)">Michael Bennett</ref>, then in the midst of his success with <ref target="/wiki/A_Chorus_Line" title="A Chorus Line">A Chorus Line</ref>. Ralph and Devine returned, and Bennett had Eyen, who was to direct, begin workshopping Big Dreams, as the musical was now known. Joining the cast at this time were Ben Harney, Obba Babatunde, Cleavant Derricks, and twenty-year-old gospel singer <ref target="/wiki/Jennifer_Holliday" title="Jennifer Holliday">Jennifer Holliday</ref> as Carter's replacement (after Carter accepted an offer from <ref target="/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</ref> to star in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gimme_a_Break" title="Gimme a Break">Gimme a Break</ref>). However, Holliday left the project during the workshopping phase, as she disliked the material and was upset that her character, Effie White, died at the conclusion of the first act. Eyen, Bennett, and Krieger continued to iron out the story and songs. Cheryl Gaines and <ref target="/wiki/Phyllis_Hyman" title="Phyllis Hyman">Phyllis Hyman</ref> were both considered as replacements for Holliday.</p>
<p>After two mildly successful workshops which included <ref target="/wiki/Jenifer_Lewis" title="Jenifer Lewis">Jenifer Lewis</ref> as Effie, Holliday returned to the project, now known as Dreamgirls. However, she found Effie's role had been reduced significantly in favor of Sheryl Lee Ralph's Deena character, and Holliday eventually quit the project again. After acquiring funding from music industry mogul <ref target="/wiki/David_Geffen" title="David Geffen">David Geffen</ref> and fellow co-financiers <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ABC_Entertainment" title="ABC Entertainment">ABC Entertainment</ref>, Metromedia, and the <ref target="/wiki/Shubert_family" title="Shubert family">Shubert family</ref>, Bennett called Holliday back and agreed to rewrite the show's second act and build up her character.<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>Gender and racial issues are represented in Dreamgirls being a black-cast musical with three female lead roles. Being set in the 1960s, the Black Power Movement was influential on the story line with black artists starting to succeed in the music industry and black music becoming accessible to all audiences, which is a representation of racial boundaries being broken down. The story is based on three women working their way up in the music industry to achieve their dreams while the most powerful people in the industry are men. In the end, the women stand up for their rights and become influential figures.</p>

<h2>Similarities to The Supremes' story[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Dreamgirls&action=edit&section=9" title="Edit section: Similarities to The Supremes' story">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Michael Bennett, Henry Krieger, Tom Eyen, and the Dreamgirls producers denied any connections between the musical's plot and the Supremes' life stories; however, the similarities between the show and actual life events within the Supremes led many to believe that the creators did actually base the musical's story on the group. It is widely believed the producers denied connections in order to avoid lawsuits from Motown, <ref target="/wiki/Berry_Gordy" title="Berry Gordy">Berry Gordy</ref>, and the Supremes. <ref target="/wiki/Mary_Wilson_(singer)" title="Mary Wilson (singer)">Mary Wilson</ref> loved Dreamgirls so much that she named her first <ref target="/wiki/Autobiography" title="Autobiography">autobiography</ref>, <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dreamgirl:_My_Life_As_a_Supreme" title="Dreamgirl: My Life As a Supreme">Dreamgirl: My Life As a Supreme</ref> after the musical. <ref target="/wiki/Diana_Ross" title="Diana Ross">Diana Ross</ref> performed "Family" from Act I in her historic free concert in New York City's Central Park in July 1983.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>] Rumors existed Ross had seen the musical and stormed out at the end of Act I, although it is unconfirmed whether this is true. Though the Deena character mirrors Diana Ross, actress Sheryl Lee Ralph stated that she was not trying to imitate Ross, but portrayed Deena in a similar, yet distinct, style.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>] In a <ref target="/wiki/Oprah:_Where_Are_They_Now%3F" title="Oprah: Where Are They Now?">Oprah: Where Are They Now?</ref> interview from 2014, Ralph had said Michael Bennett instructed her not to portray Deena like Diana Ross or else they would be sued. In the same interview, Ralph said she encountered Ross in New York shortly after the musical's opening where Ross coldly brushed her off leading to the speculation Ross knew of the show or had seen it.</p>
<p>Tom Eyen denied that he had the Supremes in mind when he wrote the book. He is quoted as saying in 1986: "I didn't grow up with the Supremes...I grew up with the Shirelles. Dreamgirls isn't about any one group. It's a cavalcade of black Motown singers: the Shirelles, the Chiffons, Martha and the Vandellas, Little Richard and Stevie Wonder. All the characters are larger than life."<ref target="#cite_note-inspirations-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>Similarities between true life events and the plot of the musical include:</p>

<p>Both the Supremes and the Dreams started off with "ettes" in their group's name. The Supremes were originally the Primettes; the Dreams start off as the Dreamettes.</p>
<p>Both the Supremes and the Dreams did background vocals for established recording artists before becoming famous.</p>
<ref target="/wiki/Diana_Ross" title="Diana Ross">Diana Ross</ref> was chosen as the lead singer of the Supremes because of her distinctive, softer, commercial voice, just as Deena Jones is chosen as the lead singer of the Dreams.
<p>The storyline of the love affair between Deena Jones and Curtis Taylor Jr. mirrors Diana Ross and Berry Gordy Jr.'s love affair and the emphasis of Diana's success over the group's.</p>
<p>The storyline of Lorrell Robinson and James "Thunder" Early's relationship resembles <ref target="/wiki/Mary_Wilson_(singer)" title="Mary Wilson (singer)">Mary Wilson</ref>'s relationships with fellow Motown artists as well as <ref target="/wiki/Welsh_people" title="Welsh people">Welsh</ref> singer <ref target="/wiki/Tom_Jones_(singer)" title="Tom Jones (singer)">Tom Jones</ref>.</p>
<p>Deena Jones is coached to be the spokesperson for the group during press conferences, just as Diana Ross was for the Supremes.</p>
<p>The press was instructed to refer to Diana Ross as "Miss Ross." In Dreamgirls, the press is instructed to refer to Deena Jones as "Miss Jones."</p>
<p>As Diana Ross was pushed forward as the star of the Supremes, Florence Ballard became angry and hostile when she was forced into the background. Effie White reacts in the same manner when Deena Jones is pushed forward as the star of the Dreams.</p>
<p>Florence Ballard missed performances, recording sessions, allegedly "faked" illnesses, and gained weight, all of which resulted in her being fired from the group in Las Vegas in 1967. The character of Effie White goes through the same experience.</p>
<ref target="/wiki/Cindy_Birdsong" title="Cindy Birdsong">Cindy Birdsong</ref> went on to perform with the Supremes the same night Florence Ballard was fired, just as Michelle Morris goes on to perform with the Dreams the same night Effie White is fired.
<p>The Supremes became "Diana Ross & the Supremes" in 1967 while in Las Vegas. The Dreams became "Deena Jones & the Dreams" in 1967 while in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>After Diana Ross left the Supremes in 1970 to pursue other projects such as film work, in 1972 she starred in her first motion picture, the Motown-produced <ref target="/wiki/Lady_Sings_the_Blues_(film)" title="Lady Sings the Blues (film)">Lady Sings the Blues</ref>. The character of Deena Jones leaves the Dreams in 1972 to pursue a career as an actress.</p>

A number of changes were made to the story as well, including the additions of more overt references to The Supremes and Motown, the death of Jimmy (who is found dead on the road after a heroin overdose), and the relocation of the story's main setting from Chicago to Detroit.

<p>To give the story more exposure for the upcoming film release, DreamWorks Pictures and the licensee of the original play, The Tams-Witmark Music Library, announced they would pay the licensing fees for all non-professional stage performances of Dreamgirls for the calendar year of 2006. DreamWorks hoped to encourage amateur productions of Dreamgirls, and familiarize a wider audience with the play. As a result, more than fifty high schools, colleges, community theaters, and other non-commercial theater entities staged productions of Dreamgirls in 2006, and DreamWorks spent up to $250,000 subsidizing the licensing.<ref target="#cite_note-11">[11]</ref></p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>1 The original Act II opening was a medley reprising the songs "Dreamgirls", "Move (You're Steppin' on My Heart)", "Love Love Me Baby", "Family", "Heavy" and "Cadillac Car", performed by Deena Jones and the Dreams, followed by most of the company participating in a reprise of "Press Conference". When the musical's national tour began in 1983, the Act II opening was changed to consist of a reprise of "Dreamgirls", and the performance of a new song, "Step on Over". With the new national tour in 2009, a new song was written, entitled "What Love Can Do", which was paired with "Step on Over" to form a new Act II opening. <ref target="/wiki/Willie_Reale" title="Willie Reale">Willie Reale</ref>, who had written the song "Patience" with Henry Krieger for the film, wrote the song’s lyrics.<ref target="#cite_note-PlaybillonReviival-12">[12]</ref> For the 2016 West End run, the Act II opening was revised once again to a full-length reprise of "Love Love Me Baby" with new lyrics by Willie Reale.<ref target="#cite_note-KreigerWestEnd-13">[13]</ref></p>

<h2>Social Impact[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Dreamgirls&action=edit&section=16" title="Edit section: Social Impact">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Due to the content of its story and focus on the struggle of African-Americans to make an imprint on the music industry, Dreamgirls is traditionally done with a mostly African-American cast. Despite this, however, many productions around the world, primarily including high school productions, have cast many of the lead characters with Caucasian actors.<ref target="#cite_note-14">[14]</ref></p>
