Their exploits captured the attention of the American press and its readership during what is sometimes referred to as the "<ref target="/wiki/Public_enemy" title="Public enemy">public enemy era</ref>" between 1931 and 1934, and they are believed to have killed at least nine police officers and four civilians.

<h2>Bonnie Parker[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Bonnie_and_Clyde&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Bonnie Parker">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Bonnie Elizabeth Parker was born in 1910 in <ref target="/wiki/Rowena,_Texas" title="Rowena, Texas">Rowena, Texas</ref>, the second of three children. Her father Charles Robert Parker (1884–1914) was a bricklayer who died when Bonnie was four years old.<ref target="#cite_note-9">[8]</ref> Her widowed mother Emma (Krause) Parker (1885–1944) moved her family back to her parents' home in Cement City, an industrial suburb in <ref target="/wiki/West_Dallas" title="West Dallas">West Dallas</ref> where she worked as a seamstress.<ref target="#cite_note-10">[9]</ref> As an adult, Bonnie wrote poems such as "The Story of Suicide Sal"<ref target="#cite_note-11">[10]</ref> and "The Trail's End", the latter more commonly known as "The Story of Bonnie and Clyde".<ref target="#cite_note-12">[11]</ref></p>
<p>In her second year in high school, Parker met Roy Thornton. They dropped out of school and were married on September 25, 1926, six days before her 16th birthday.<ref target="#cite_note-13">[12]</ref> Their marriage was marked by his frequent absences and brushes with the law, and it proved to be short-lived. They never divorced, but their paths never crossed again after January 1929. She was still wearing his wedding ring when she died.<ref target="#cite_note-14">[notes 2]</ref> Thornton was still in prison when he heard of her death. He commented, "I'm glad they went out like they did. It's much better than being caught."<ref target="#cite_note-roy-15">[13]</ref></p>
<p>Parker lived with her mother again after the failure of her marriage, and she worked as a waitress in Dallas. One of her regular customers was postal worker <ref target="/wiki/Ted_Hinton" title="Ted Hinton">Ted Hinton</ref>. In 1932, he joined the Dallas Sheriff's Department and eventually served as a member of the posse that killed Bonnie and Clyde.<ref target="#cite_note-16">[14]</ref> Parker briefly kept a diary early in 1929 when she was 19, in which she wrote of her loneliness, her impatience with life in Dallas, and her love of <ref target="/wiki/Sound_film" title="Sound film">talking pictures</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-17">[15]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-Barrow2017p59-18">[16]</ref></p>

<h2>Clyde Barrow[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Bonnie_and_Clyde&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Clyde Barrow">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Clyde Chestnut Barrow<ref target="#cite_note-19">[17]</ref> was born in 1909 into a poor farming family in <ref target="/wiki/Ellis_County,_Texas" title="Ellis County, Texas">Ellis County, Texas</ref>, southeast of Dallas.<ref target="#cite_note-20">[18]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-21">[19]</ref> He was the fifth of seven children of Henry Basil Barrow (1874–1957) and Cumie Talitha Walker (1874–1942). The family moved to Dallas in the early 1920s, part of a migration pattern from rural areas to the city where many settled in the urban slum of West Dallas. The Barrows spent their first months in West Dallas living under their wagon until they got enough money to buy a tent.<ref target="#cite_note-22">[20]</ref></p>
<p>Barrow was first arrested at the age of 17 in late 1926 after running when police confronted him over a rental car that he had failed to return on time. His second arrest was with brother <ref target="/wiki/Buck_Barrow" title="Buck Barrow">Buck</ref> soon after for possession of stolen turkeys. He had some legitimate jobs during 1927 through 1929, but he also cracked safes, robbed stores, and stole cars. He met 19 year-old Parker through a mutual friend in January 1930, and they spent much time together during the following weeks. Their romance was cut short when Barrow was arrested and convicted of auto theft.</p>
<p>Clyde was sent to <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eastham_Prison_Farm" title="Eastham Prison Farm">Eastham Prison Farm</ref> in April 1930 at the age of 21. While in prison, he retaliated for repeated sexual assaults by attacking and killing his tormentor with a lead pipe, crushing his skull.<ref target="#cite_note-23">[21]</ref> This was his first killing. Another inmate who was already serving a life sentence took the blame. In order to avoid hard labor in the fields, Barrow had another inmate chop off two of his toes with an axe. Because of this, he walked with a limp for the rest of his life. However, he was set free six days after his intentional injury. Without his knowledge, his mother had successfully petitioned for his release.<ref target="#cite_note-AmExp-24">[22]</ref></p>
<p>In 1930, Barrow escaped Eastham Prison Farm, using a weapon which Parker smuggled to him. He was recaptured shortly after and sent back to prison.<ref target="#cite_note-25">[23]</ref> He was paroled on February 2, 1932 from Eastham as a hardened and bitter criminal. His sister Marie said, "Something awful sure must have happened to him in prison because he wasn't the same person when he got out."<ref target="#cite_note-26">[24]</ref> Fellow inmate <ref target="/wiki/Ralph_Fults" title="Ralph Fults">Ralph Fults</ref> said that he watched Clyde "change from a schoolboy to a rattlesnake".<ref target="#cite_note-27">[25]</ref></p>
<p>In his post-Eastham career, Barrow robbed grocery stores and gas stations at a rate far outpacing the ten or so bank robberies attributed to him and the Barrow Gang. His favorite weapon was the <ref target="/wiki/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle" title="M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle">M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle</ref> (BAR).<ref target="#cite_note-AmExp-24">[22]</ref> According to John Neal Phillips, Barrow's goal in life was not to gain fame or fortune from robbing banks but to seek revenge against the Texas prison system for the abuses that he suffered while serving time.<ref target="#cite_note-eastham-28">[26]</ref></p>

<h2>First meeting[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Bonnie_and_Clyde&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: First meeting">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Several accounts describe Parker and Barrow's first meeting. The most credible states that they met on January 5, 1930 at the home of Barrow's friend Clarence Clay at 105 Herbert Street<ref target="#cite_note-29">[27]</ref> in the neighborhood of West Dallas. He was 20 years old, and she was 19. Parker was out of work and staying with a female friend to assist her during her recovery from a broken arm. Barrow dropped by the girl's house while Parker was in the kitchen making hot chocolate.<ref target="#cite_note-30">[28]</ref> Both were smitten immediately; most historians believe that Parker joined Barrow because she had fallen in love with him. She remained his loyal companion as they carried out their many crimes and awaited the violent death which they viewed as inevitable.<ref target="#cite_note-31">[29]</ref></p>

<p>On March 22, 1933, Clyde's brother Buck was granted a full pardon and released from prison, and he and his wife <ref target="/wiki/Blanche_Barrow" title="Blanche Barrow">Blanche</ref> set up housekeeping with Bonnie, Clyde and Jones in a temporary <ref target="/wiki/Bonnie_%26_Clyde_Garage_Apartment" title="Bonnie & Clyde Garage Apartment">hideout at 3347 1/2 Oakridge Drive</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/Joplin,_Missouri" title="Joplin, Missouri">Joplin, Missouri</ref>. According to family sources,<ref target="#cite_note-43">[40]</ref> Buck and Blanche were there to visit; they attempted to persuade Clyde to surrender to law enforcement. The group ran loud, alcohol-fueled card games late into the night in the quiet neighborhood; Blanche recalled that they "bought a case of beer a day".<ref target="#cite_note-44">[41]</ref> The men came and went noisily at all hours, and Clyde accidentally fired a <ref target="/wiki/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle" title="M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle">BAR</ref> in the apartment while cleaning it.<ref target="#cite_note-45">[42]</ref> No neighbors went to the house, but one reported suspicions to the Joplin Police Department.</p>
<p>The police assembled a five-man force in two cars on April 13 to confront what they suspected were bootleggers living in the garage apartment. The Barrow brothers and Jones opened fire, killing Detective McGinnis outright and fatally wounding Constable Harryman.<ref target="#cite_note-46">[43]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-47">[44]</ref> Parker opened fire with a BAR as the others fled, forcing Highway Patrol Sergeant G.B.

<p>The group escaped the police at Joplin, but left behind most of their possessions at the apartment, including Buck's parole papers (three weeks old), a large arsenal of weapons, a handwritten poem by Bonnie, and a camera with several rolls of undeveloped film.<ref target="#cite_note-51">[48]</ref> Police developed the film at <ref target="/wiki/The_Joplin_Globe" title="The Joplin Globe">The Joplin Globe</ref> and found many photos of Barrow, Parker, and Jones posing and pointing weapons at one another.<ref target="#cite_note-52">[49]</ref> The Globe sent the poem and the photos over the newswire, including a photo of Parker clenching a cigar in her teeth and a pistol in her hand, and the gang of criminals became front-page news throughout America as the Barrow Gang.</p>
<p>The photo of Parker posing with a cigar and a gun became popular:</p>

Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker were wild and young, and undoubtedly slept together.<ref target="#cite_note-53">[50]</ref></p>

<p>The group ranged from Texas as far north as <ref target="/wiki/Minnesota" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</ref> for the next three months. In May, they tried to rob the bank in <ref target="/wiki/Lucerne,_Indiana" title="Lucerne, Indiana">Lucerne, Indiana</ref>,<ref target="#cite_note-54">[51]</ref> and robbed the bank in <ref target="/wiki/Okabena,_Minnesota" title="Okabena, Minnesota">Okabena, Minnesota</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-55">[52]</ref> They kidnapped Dillard Darby and Sophia Stone at <ref target="/wiki/Ruston,_Louisiana" title="Ruston, Louisiana">Ruston, Louisiana</ref> in the course of stealing Darby's car; this was one of several events between 1932 and 1934 in which they kidnapped police officers or robbery victims.<ref target="#cite_note-56">[notes 4]</ref> They usually released their hostages far from home, sometimes with money to help them return home.<ref target="#cite_note-riding-5">[5]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-dallasnews-57">[53]</ref></p>
<p>Stories of such encounters made headlines, as did the more violent episodes. The Barrow Gang did not hesitate to shoot anyone who got in their way, whether it was a police officer or an innocent civilian. Other members of the Barrow Gang who committed murder included Raymond Hamilton, W.D. Jones, Clyde's brother Buck, and Henry Methvin.

<p>The photos entertained the public for a time, but the gang was desperate and discontented, as described by Blanche in her account written while imprisoned in the late 1930s.<ref target="#cite_note-59">[55]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-60">[notes 5]</ref> With their new notoriety, their daily lives became more difficult, as they tried to evade discovery. Restaurants and motels became less secure; they resorted to campfire cooking and bathing in cold streams.<ref target="#cite_note-61">[56]</ref> The unrelieved, round-the-clock proximity of five people in one car gave rise to vicious bickering.<ref target="#cite_note-62">[57]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-63">[notes 6]</ref> Jones was the driver when he and Barrow stole a car belonging to Dillard Darby in late April, and he used that car to leave the others.

The hide on her right leg was gone, from her hip down to her ankle. I could see the bone at places."<ref target="#cite_note-70">[63]</ref></p>
<p>Parker could hardly walk; she either hopped on her good leg or was carried by Barrow. They got help from a nearby farm family, then kidnapped two local police officers. The three rendezvoused with Buck and Blanche, and hid in a tourist court near <ref target="/wiki/Fort_Smith,_Arkansas" title="Fort Smith, Arkansas">Fort Smith, Arkansas</ref>, nursing Parker's burns.

<p>In July 1933, the gang checked in to the <ref target="/wiki/Red_Crown_Tourist_Court" title="Red Crown Tourist Court">Red Crown Tourist Court</ref><ref target="#cite_note-platte-73">[66]</ref> south of <ref target="/wiki/Platte_City,_Missouri" title="Platte City, Missouri">Platte City, Missouri</ref>. It consisted of two brick cabins joined by garages, and the gang rented both.<ref target="#cite_note-platte-73">[66]</ref> To the south stood the Red Crown Tavern, a popular restaurant among Missouri Highway Patrolmen, and the gang seemed to go out of their way to draw attention.<ref target="#cite_note-74">[67]</ref> Blanche registered the party as three guests, but owner Neal Houser could see five people getting out of the car. He noted that the driver backed into the garage "gangster style" for a quick getaway.<ref target="#cite_note-Guinn,_p_211-75">[68]</ref> Blanche paid for their cabins with coins rather than bills, and did the same later when buying five dinners and five beers.<ref target="#cite_note-76">[69]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-77">[notes 8]</ref> The next day, Houser noticed that his guests had taped newspapers over the windows of their cabin; Blanche again paid for five meals with coins. Her outfit of <ref target="/wiki/Jodhpurs" title="Jodhpurs">jodhpur</ref> riding breeches<ref target="#cite_note-78">[70]</ref> also attracted attention; they were not typical attire for women in the area, and eyewitnesses still remembered them 40 years later.<ref target="#cite_note-Guinn,_p_211-75">[68]</ref> Houser told Captain William Baxter of the Highway Patrol, a patron of his restaurant, about the group.<ref target="#cite_note-platte-73">[66]</ref></p>
<p>Clyde and Jones went into town<ref target="#cite_note-79">[notes 9]</ref> to purchase bandages, crackers, cheese, and <ref target="/wiki/Atropine" title="Atropine">atropine</ref> sulfate to treat Parker's leg.<ref target="#cite_note-80">[71]</ref> The druggist contacted Sheriff <ref target="/wiki/Holt_Coffey" title="Holt Coffey">Holt Coffey</ref>, who put the cabins under surveillance.

Local police officers and approximately 100 spectators surrounded the group, and the Barrows soon came under fire.<ref target="#cite_note-road-85">[75]</ref> Clyde, Parker, and Jones escaped on foot.<ref target="#cite_note-riding-5">[5]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-road-85">[75]</ref> Buck was shot in the back, and he and his wife were captured by the officers.

<p>For the next six weeks, the remaining perpetrators ranged far afield from their usual area of operations, west to Colorado, north to Minnesota, southeast to Mississippi; yet they continued to commit armed robberies.<ref target="#cite_note-87">[77]</ref> <ref target="#cite_note-88">[notes 11]</ref> They restocked their arsenal when Barrow and Jones robbed an armory at <ref target="/wiki/Plattville,_Illinois" title="Plattville, Illinois">Plattville, Illinois</ref> on August 20, acquiring three BARs, handguns, and a large quantity of ammunition.<ref target="#cite_note-89">[78]</ref></p>
<p>By early September, they risked a run to Dallas to see their families for the first time in four months. Jones parted company with them, continuing to Houston where his mother had moved.<ref target="#cite_note-riding-5">[5]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-road-85">[75]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-90">[notes 12]</ref> He was arrested there without incident on November 16, and returned to Dallas. Through the autumn, Barrow committed several robberies with small-time local accomplices, while his family and Parker's attended to her considerable medical needs. On November 22, they narrowly evaded arrest while trying to meet with family members near <ref target="/wiki/Sowers,_Texas" title="Sowers, Texas">Sowers, Texas</ref>. Dallas' Sherriff Smoot Schmid, Deputy Bob Alcorn, and Deputy Ted Hinton lay in wait nearby. As Barrow drove up, he sensed a trap and drove past his family's car, at which point Schmid and his deputies stood up and opened fire with machine guns and a BAR. The family members in the crossfire were not hit, but a BAR bullet passed through the car, striking the legs of both Barrow and Parker.<ref target="#cite_note-Knight_and_Davis,_p._118-91">[79]</ref> They escaped later that night.</p>
<p>On November 28, a Dallas grand jury delivered a murder indictment against Parker and Barrow for the murder - in January of that year - of Tarrant County Deputy Malcolm Davis;<ref target="#cite_note-Slaying_Bill_1933,_p_1-92">[80]</ref> it was Parker's first warrant for murder.</p>

<h3>1934: Final run[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Bonnie_and_Clyde&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: 1934: Final run">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>On January 16, 1934, Barrow orchestrated the escape of <ref target="/wiki/Raymond_Hamilton" title="Raymond Hamilton">Raymond Hamilton</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Henry_Methvin" title="Henry Methvin">Henry Methvin</ref>, and several others in the "<ref target="/wiki/Eastham_Unit" title="Eastham Unit">Eastham</ref> Breakout".<ref target="#cite_note-eastham-28">[26]</ref> The brazen raid generated negative publicity for Texas, and Barrow seemed to have achieved what historian Phillips suggests was his overriding goal: revenge on the <ref target="/wiki/Texas_Department_of_Criminal_Justice" title="Texas Department of Criminal Justice">Texas Department of Corrections</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-93">[notes 13]</ref></p>
<p>Joe Palmer shot Major Joe Crowson during his escape, and Crowson died a few days later in the hospital.<ref target="#cite_note-94">[81]</ref> This attack attracted the full power of the Texas and federal government to the manhunt for Barrow and Parker. As Crowson struggled for life, prison chief Lee Simmons reportedly promised him that all persons involved in the breakout would be hunted down and killed.<ref target="#cite_note-eastham-28">[26]</ref> All of them eventually were except for Methvin, who preserved his life by setting up the ambush of Barrow and Parker.<ref target="#cite_note-eastham-28">[26]</ref></p>
<p>The Texas Department of Corrections contacted former <ref target="/wiki/Texas_Ranger_Division" title="Texas Ranger Division">Texas Ranger</ref> Captain <ref target="/wiki/Frank_Hamer" title="Frank Hamer">Frank Hamer</ref> and persuaded him to hunt down the Barrow Gang. He was retired, but his commission had not expired.<ref target="#cite_note-95">[82]</ref> He accepted the assignment as a <ref target="/wiki/Texas_Department_of_Public_Safety" title="Texas Department of Public Safety">Texas Highway Patrol</ref> officer, secondarily assigned to the prison system as a special investigator, and given the specific task of taking down Bonnie, Clyde, and the rest of the Barrow Gang.</p>

<p>Hamer was tall, burly, and taciturn, unimpressed by authority and driven by an "inflexible adherence to right, or what he thinks is right".<ref target="#cite_note-96">[83]</ref> For 20 years, he had been feared and admired throughout Texas as "the walking embodiment of the '<ref target='/wiki/Texas_Ranger_Division#"One_Riot,_One_Ranger"' title="Texas Ranger Division">One Riot, One Ranger</ref>' ethos".<ref target="#cite_note-97">[84]</ref> He "had acquired a formidable reputation as a result of several spectacular captures and the shooting of a number of Texas criminals".<ref target="#cite_note-98">[85]</ref> He was officially credited with 53 kills, and suffered 17 wounds.<ref target="#cite_note-99">[86]</ref> Prison boss Simmons always said publicly that Hamer had been his first choice, although there is evidence that he first approached two other Rangers, both of whom declined because they were reluctant to shoot a woman.<ref target="#cite_note-100">[87]</ref> Starting on February 10, Hamer became the constant shadow of Barrow and Parker, living out of his car, just a town or two behind them. Three of his four brothers were also Texas Rangers; brother Harrison was the best shot of the four, but Frank was considered the most tenacious.<ref target="#cite_note-101">[88]</ref></p>
<p>Barrow and Methvin killed highway patrolmen H.D. Murphy and Edward Bryant Wheeler on Easter Sunday, April 1, 1934 at the intersection of Route 114 and Dove Road, near <ref target="/wiki/Grapevine,_Texas" title="Grapevine, Texas">Grapevine, Texas</ref> (now <ref target="/wiki/Southlake,_Texas" title="Southlake, Texas">Southlake</ref>).<ref target="#cite_note-102">[89]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-103">[90]</ref> An eyewitness account said that Barrow and Parker fired the fatal shots, and this story got widespread coverage<ref target="#cite_note-104">[91]</ref> before it was discredited. Methvin later admitted that he fired the first shot, after assuming that Barrow wanted the officers killed; he also said that Parker approached the dying officers intending to help them, not to administer the <ref target="/wiki/Coup_de_gr%C3%A2ce" title="Coup de grâce">coup de grâce</ref> as described by the discredited eyewitness. Barrow joined in, firing at Patrolman Murphy. It has long been assumed that Parker was asleep in the back seat when Methvin started shooting, and took no part in the assault.<ref target="#cite_note-dallasnews-57">[53]</ref></p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:B%26CElecChairEditCartoon1934.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:B%26CElecChairEditCartoon1934.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>Public opinion turned against the couple after the Grapevine murders and resultant negative publicity
<p>During the spring season, the Grapevine killings were recounted in exaggerated detail, affecting public perception; all four Dallas daily papers seized on the story told by the eyewitness, a farmer who claimed to have seen Parker laugh at the way that Patrolman Murphy's head "bounced like a rubber ball" on the ground as she shot him.<ref target="#cite_note-105">[92]</ref> The stories claimed that police found a cigar butt "with tiny teeth marks", supposedly those of Parker.<ref target="#cite_note-106">[93]</ref> Several days later, Murphy's fiancée wore her intended wedding dress to his funeral, attracting photos and newspaper coverage.<ref target="#cite_note-107">[94]</ref> The eyewitness's ever-changing story was soon discredited, but the massive negative publicity increased the public clamor for the extermination of the Barrow Gang. The outcry galvanized the authorities into action, and Highway Patrol boss L.G. Phares offered a reward of $1,000 for "the dead bodies of the Grapevine slayers" — not their capture, just the bodies.<ref target="#cite_note-Knight_and_Davis,_p_147-108">[95]</ref> Texas governor <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ma_Ferguson" title="Ma Ferguson">Ma Ferguson</ref> added another reward of $500 for each of the two killers, which meant that, for the first time, "there was a specific price on Bonnie's head, since she was so widely believed to have shot H.D. Murphy".<ref target="#cite_note-109">[96]</ref></p>
<p>Public hostility increased five days later, when Barrow and Methvin murdered 60 year-old Constable William "Cal" Campbell, a widower and father, near <ref target="/wiki/Commerce,_Oklahoma" title="Commerce, Oklahoma">Commerce, Oklahoma</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-110">[97]</ref> They kidnapped Commerce police chief Percy Boyd, crossed the state line into Kansas, and let him go, giving him a clean shirt, a few dollars, and a request from Parker to tell the world that she did not smoke cigars. Boyd identified both Barrow and Parker to authorities, but he never learned Methvin's name. The resultant arrest warrant for the Campbell murder specified "Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker and John Doe".<ref target="#cite_note-111">[98]</ref> Historian Knight writes: "For the first time, Bonnie was seen as a killer, actually pulling the trigger — just like Clyde. Whatever chance she had for clemency had just been reduced."<ref target="#cite_note-Knight_and_Davis,_p_147-108">[95]</ref> The Dallas Journal ran a cartoon on its editorial page, showing an empty electric chair with a sign on it saying "Reserved", adding the words "Clyde and Bonnie".<ref target="#cite_note-112">[99]</ref></p>

He studied the gang's movements and found that they swung in a circle skirting the edges of five midwestern states, exploiting the "state line" rule which prevented officers from pursuing a fugitive into another jurisdiction. Barrow was consistent in his movements, so Hamer charted his path and predicted where he would go. The gang's itinerary centered on family visits, and they were due to see Methvin's family in Louisiana.</p>

<p>On May 21, the four posse members from Texas were in <ref target="/wiki/Shreveport,_Louisiana" title="Shreveport, Louisiana">Shreveport, Louisiana</ref> when they learned that Barrow and Parker were to go to Bienville Parish that evening with Methvin. Barrow had designated the residence of Methvin's parents as a rendezvous, in case they were separated, and Methvin did get separated from them in Shreveport. The full posse set up an ambush at the rendezvous point along Louisiana State Highway 154 south of <ref target="/wiki/Gibsland,_Louisiana" title="Gibsland, Louisiana">Gibsland</ref> toward Sailes. Hinton recounted that their group was in place by 9pm, and waited through the whole of the next day (May 22) with no sign of the perpetrators<ref target="#cite_note-Hinton-115">[102]</ref> Other accounts said that the officers set up on the evening of the 22nd.<ref target="#cite_note-116">[103]</ref></p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Bonnie_Clyde_Car.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Bonnie_Clyde_Car.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>The gunfire was so loud that the posse suffered temporary deafness all afternoon
<p>At approximately 9:15 am on May 23, the posse were still concealed in the bushes and almost ready to concede defeat, when they heard Barrow's stolen <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ford_Model_B_(1932)" title="Ford Model B (1932)">Ford V8</ref> approaching at a high speed. Their official report had Barrow stopping to speak with Methvin's father, who had been planted there with his truck that morning, to distract Barrow and force him into the lane closer to the posse. The lawmen opened fire, killing Barrow and Parker while shooting about 130 rounds. Oakley fired first, probably before any order to do so.<ref target="#cite_note-Hinton-115">[102]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-Knight_and_Davis,_p_166-117">[104]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-118">[105]</ref> Barrow was killed instantly by Oakley's head shot, but Hinton reported hearing Parker scream as she realized that Barrow was dead, before the shooting began in her direction.<ref target="#cite_note-Hinton-115">[102]</ref> The officers emptied all their weapons at the car.<ref target="#cite_note-posse-119">[106]</ref> Nearly any of their wounds would have been fatal, yet the two had survived many bullets over the years in their confrontations with the law.<ref target="#cite_note-120">[107]</ref></p>
<p>According to statements made by Hinton and Alcorn:</p>

<p>Each of us six officers had a shotgun and an automatic rifle and pistols. We opened fire with the automatic rifles. They were emptied before the car got even with us. Then we used shotguns. There was smoke coming from the car, and it looked like it was on fire. After shooting the shotguns, we emptied the pistols at the car, which had passed us and ran into a ditch about 50 yards on down the road. It almost turned over. We kept shooting at the car even after it stopped. We weren't taking any chances.<ref target="#cite_note-dispatch-113">[100]</ref></p>

<p>Researchers have said that Barrow and Parker were shot more than 50 times each;<ref target="#cite_note-eastham-28">[26]</ref> others claim closer to 25 each, or 50 in total.<ref target="#cite_note-artifacts-121">[108]</ref> Officially, the 1934 report by parish coroner Dr. J. L. Wade, listed 17 separate entrance wounds on Barrow's body and 26 on that of Parker,<ref target="#cite_note-122">[109]</ref> including several headshots on each, and one that had snapped Barrow's spinal column. Undertaker C.F. "Boots" Bailey had difficulty embalming the bodies because of all the bullet holes.<ref target="#cite_note-123">[110]</ref></p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:BarrowDeathCarArsenal1934.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:BarrowDeathCarArsenal1934.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>The perpetrators had more than a dozen guns and several thousand rounds of ammunition in the Ford, including 100 20-round BAR magazines
<p>The deafened officers inspected the vehicle and discovered an arsenal of weapons, including stolen automatic rifles, sawed-off semi-automatic shotguns, assorted handguns, and several thousand rounds of ammunition, along with 15 sets of license plates from various states.<ref target="#cite_note-posse-119">[106]</ref> Hamer stated: "I hate to bust the cap on a woman, especially when she was sitting down, however if it wouldn't have been her, it would have been us."<ref target="#cite_note-124">[111]</ref> Word of the deaths quickly got around when Hamer, Jordan, Oakley, and Hinton drove into town to telephone their respective bosses. A crowd soon gathered at the spot. Gault and Alcorn were left to guard the bodies, but they lost control of the jostling, curious throng; one woman cut off bloody locks of Parker's hair and pieces from her dress, which were subsequently sold as souvenirs. Hinton returned to find a man trying to cut off Barrow's trigger finger, and was sickened by what was occurring.<ref target="#cite_note-Hinton-115">[102]</ref> Arriving at the scene, the coroner said that he saw the following:</p>

<p>Nearly everyone had begun collecting souvenirs such as shell casings, slivers of glass from the shattered car windows, and bloody pieces of clothing from the garments of Bonnie and Clyde. One eager man had opened his pocket knife, and was reaching into the car to cut off Clyde's left ear.<ref target="#cite_note-Milner-125">[112]</ref></p>

<p>The coroner enlisted Hamer for help in controlling the "circus-like atmosphere", and got people away from the car.<ref target="#cite_note-Milner-125">[112]</ref></p>
<p>They towed the Ford, with the dead bodies still inside, to the Conger Furniture Store & Funeral Parlor in downtown <ref target="/wiki/Arcadia,_Louisiana" title="Arcadia, Louisiana">Arcadia, Louisiana</ref>. Barrow had been shot in the head by a .35 <ref target="/wiki/Remington_Model_8" title="Remington Model 8">Remington Model 8</ref>. Preliminary embalming was done by Bailey in a small preparation room in the back of the furniture store, as it was common for furniture stores and undertakers to share the same space.<ref target="#cite_note-funeral-126">[113]</ref> The population of the northwest Louisiana town reportedly swelled from 2,000 to 12,000 within hours. Curious throngs arrived by train, horseback, buggy, and plane. Beer normally sold for 15 cents a bottle but it jumped to 25 cents, and sandwiches quickly sold out.<ref target="#cite_note-127">[114]</ref> Henry Barrow identified his son's body, then sat weeping in a rocking chair in the furniture section.<ref target="#cite_note-funeral-126">[113]</ref></p>
<p>H.D. Darby was an undertaker at the McClure Funeral Parlor in nearby <ref target="/wiki/Ruston,_Louisiana" title="Ruston, Louisiana">Ruston</ref>, and Sophia Stone was a home demonstration agent from Ruston.

<p>Bonnie and Clyde wished to be buried side by side, but the Parker family would not allow it.

<p>Thousands of people gathered outside both Dallas funeral homes, hoping for a chance to view the bodies. Barrow's private funeral was held at sunset on May 25.<ref target="#cite_note-funeral-126">[113]</ref> He was buried in Western Heights Cemetery in Dallas, next to his brother Marvin. The Barrow brothers share a single granite marker with their names on it and an epitaph selected by Clyde: "Gone but not forgotten."<ref target="#cite_note-131">[118]</ref></p>

<p>By the summer of 1934, new federal statutes made bank robbery and kidnapping federal offenses. The growing coordination of local authorities by the FBI, plus two-way radios in police cars, combined to make it more difficult to carry out series of robberies and murders than it had been just months before. Two months after Gibsland, Dillinger was killed on the street in Chicago; three months after that, Pretty Boy Floyd was killed in Ohio; and one month after that, <ref target="/wiki/Baby_Face_Nelson" title="Baby Face Nelson">Baby Face Nelson</ref> was killed in Illinois.<ref target="#cite_note-136">[123]</ref></p>

<h2>Differing accounts[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Bonnie_and_Clyde&action=edit&section=11" title="Edit section: Differing accounts">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The members of the posse came from three organizations: Hamer and Gault were both former Texas Rangers then working for the Texas Department of Corrections (DOC), Hinton and Alcorn were employees of the Dallas Sheriff's office, and Jordan and Oakley were Sheriff and Deputy of Bienville Parish, Louisiana. The three duos distrusted one another and kept to themselves,<ref target="#cite_note-137">[124]</ref> and each carried their own agenda into the operation and brought differing narratives out of it. Simmons, the head of the Texas DOC, brought another perspective, having effectively commissioned the posse.</p>
<p>Dallas Sheriff Schmid had tried to arrest Barrow in Sowers, Texas in November 1933. Schmid called "Halt!" and gunfire erupted from the outlaw car, which made a quick U-turn and sped away. Schmid's Thompson submachine gun jammed on the first round, and he could not get off one shot. Pursuit of Barrow was impossible because the posse had parked their own cars at a distance to prevent their being seen.<ref target="#cite_note-Knight_and_Davis,_p._118-91">[79]</ref></p>
<p>Hamer's posse discussed calling "halt" but the four Texans "vetoed the idea",<ref target="#cite_note-138">[125]</ref> telling them that the serial killers' history had always been to shoot their way out,<ref target="#cite_note-Knight_and_Davis,_p_166-117">[104]</ref> as had occurred in Platte City, Dexfield Park, and Sowers.<ref target="#cite_note-139">[126]</ref> When the ambush occurred, Oakley stood up and opened fire, and the other officers opened fire immediately after.<ref target="#cite_note-Knight_and_Davis,_p_166-117">[104]</ref> Jordan was reported to have called out to Barrow;<ref target="#cite_note-140">[127]</ref> Alcorn said that Hamer called out;<ref target="#cite_note-141">[128]</ref> and Hinton claimed that Alcorn did.<ref target="#cite_note-Hinton-115">[102]</ref> In another report, each said that they both did.<ref target="#cite_note-142">[129]</ref> These conflicting claims might have been collegial attempts to divert the focus from Oakley, who later admitted firing too early, but that is merely speculation.<ref target="#cite_note-Guinn,_p_357-143">[130]</ref></p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:HenryMethvinMugshot1931.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:HenryMethvinMugshot1931.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>Henry Methvin escaped prosecution for the two Grapevine, Texas murders because of his father's cooperation with the posse. But he was prosecuted for other crimes in Oklahoma, where he was convicted and served eight years.
<p>In 1979, Hinton's account of the saga was published posthumously as Ambush: The Real Story of Bonnie and Clyde.<ref target="#cite_note-144">[131]</ref> His version of the Methvin family's involvement in the planning and execution of the ambush was that the posse had tied Methvin's father Ivy to a tree the previous night to keep him from warning off the serial killers.<ref target="#cite_note-Hinton-115">[102]</ref> Hinton claimed that Hamer made a deal with Ivy: if he kept quiet about being tied up, his son would escape prosecution for the two Grapevine murders.<ref target="#cite_note-Hinton-115">[102]</ref> Hinton alleged that Hamer made every member of the posse swear that they would never divulge this secret.</p>
<p>Other accounts, however, place Ivy at the center of the action, not tied up but on the road, waving for Barrow to stop.<ref target="#cite_note-Knight_and_Davis,_p_147-108">[95]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-145">[132]</ref> Hinton's memoir suggests that Parker's cigar in the famous "cigar photo" had been a rose, and that it was retouched as a cigar by darkroom staff at the Joplin Globe while they prepared the photo for publication.<ref target="#cite_note-146">[133]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-147">[notes 14]</ref> Guinn says that some people who knew Hinton suspect that "he became delusional late in life".<ref target="#cite_note-148">[134]</ref></p>

<h2>Aftermath[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Bonnie_and_Clyde&action=edit&section=12" title="Edit section: Aftermath">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The posse never received the promised bounty on the perpetrators, so they were told to take whatever they wanted from the confiscated items in their car. Hamer appropriated the arsenal<ref target="#cite_note-149">[135]</ref> of stolen guns and ammunition, plus a box of fishing tackle, under the terms of his compensation package with the Texas Department of Corrections.<ref target="#cite_note-150">[notes 15]</ref> In July, Clyde's mother Cumie wrote to Hamer asking for the return of the guns: "You don't never want to forget my boy was never tried in no court for murder, and no one is guilty until proven guilty by some court so I hope you will answer this letter and also return the guns I am asking for."<ref target="#cite_note-tre224-151">[136]</ref> There is no record of any response.<ref target="#cite_note-tre224-151">[136]</ref></p>
<p>Alcorn claimed Barrow's saxophone from the car, but he later donated it to the Barrow family.<ref target="#cite_note-Guinn,_p_343-152">[137]</ref> Posse members also took other personal items, such as Parker's clothing. The Parker family asked for them back but were refused,<ref target="#cite_note-posse-119">[106]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-153">[138]</ref> and the items were later sold as souvenirs.<ref target="#cite_note-154">[139]</ref> The Barrow family claimed that Sheriff Jordan kept an alleged suitcase of cash, and writer Jeff Guinn claims that Jordan bought "barn and land in Arcadia" soon after the event, thereby hinting that the accusation had merit — despite the complete absence of any evidence to the existence of such a suitcase.<ref target="#cite_note-Guinn,_p_343-152">[137]</ref> Jordan did attempt to keep the death car for his own, but Ruth Warren of Topeka sued him because she was the owner of the car when Barrow stole it on April 29;<ref target="#cite_note-155">[140]</ref> Jordan returned it to her in August 1934, still covered with blood and human tissue.<ref target="#cite_note-156">[141]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-157">[notes 16]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-158">[142]</ref></p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:BlancheBarrowMug1933.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:BlancheBarrowMug1933.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>Blanche never carried a gun; she was convicted of attempted murder and served six years.
<p>In February 1935, Dallas and federal authorities arrested and tried 20 family members and friends for aiding and abetting Barrow and Parker. This became known as the harboring trial and all 20 either pleaded guilty or were found guilty. The two mothers were jailed for 30 days; other sentences ranged from two years' imprisonment (for Floyd Hamilton, brother of Raymond) to one hour in custody (for Barrow's teenage sister Marie).<ref target="#cite_note-159">[143]</ref> Other defendants included <ref target="/wiki/Blanche_Barrow" title="Blanche Barrow">Blanche Barrow</ref>, W.D. Jones, Methvin, and Parker's sister Billie.</p>
<p>Blanche was permanently blinded in her left eye during the 1933 shootout at Dexfield Park. She was taken into custody on the charge of "assault with intent to kill". She was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison, but was paroled in 1939 for good behavior. She returned to Dallas, leaving her life of crime in the past, and lived with her invalid father as his caregiver. In 1940, she married Eddie Frasure, worked as a taxi cab dispatcher and a beautician, and completed the terms of her parole one year later. She lived in peace with her husband until he died of cancer in 1969. <ref target="/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</ref> approached her to purchase the rights to her name for use in the 1967 film <ref target="/wiki/Bonnie_and_Clyde_(film)" title="Bonnie and Clyde (film)">Bonnie and Clyde</ref>, and she agreed to the original script. However, she objected to her characterization by <ref target="/wiki/Estelle_Parsons" title="Estelle Parsons">Estelle Parsons</ref> in the final film, describing the actress's Academy Award-winning portrayal of her as "a screaming horse's ass". Despite this, she maintained a firm friendship with Beatty. She died from cancer at age 77 on December 24, 1988 and was buried in Dallas's Grove Hill Memorial Park under the name "Blanche B. Frasure".<ref target="#cite_note-160">[144]</ref></p>

He was returned to Dallas, where he dictated a "confession" in which he claimed to have been kept a prisoner by Barrow and Parker.

<p>Methvin was convicted in Oklahoma of the 1934 murder of Constable Campbell at Commerce. He was paroled in 1942 and killed by a train in 1948.

<p>Hamer returned to a quiet life as a freelance security consultant for oil companies.

<ref target="#cite_ref-7">^</ref> Parker was Bonnie's mother, Cowan was Clyde's sister, and Fortune was a Dallas writer and reporter who was the primary author. Parker and Cowan repudiated the book immediately upon its publication.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>] Page numbers in footnotes refer to the 1968 paperback edition.

<ref target="#cite_ref-14">^</ref> A few months after their breakup, Thornton was convicted and imprisoned for robbery. Parker told her mother, "Well, I didn't get [a divorce] before Roy was sent up, and it looks sort of dirty to file for one now." Parker, Cowan and Fortune, p. 56

<ref target="#cite_ref-35">^</ref> Parker composed these poems in an old bankbook which the jailer's wife had given her to use as paper. Some were her own work, and some were songs and poems she copied from memory. She titled the lot Poetry From Life's Other Side. After being released from jail, she either left it behind or gave it to the jailer. In 2007, the bankbook sold for $36,000. <ref class="external text" href="http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/public.sh/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=EUR&screen=WholeCataloguePrint&iSaleNo=15291" rel="nofollow">Item 5337</ref> <ref class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110708082454/http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/public.sh/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=EUR&screen=WholeCataloguePrint&iSaleNo=15291" rel="nofollow">Archived</ref> July 8, 2011, at the <ref target="/wiki/Wayback_Machine" title="Wayback Machine">Wayback Machine</ref> <ref class="external text" href="http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/public.sh/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=EUR&screen=aboutus" rel="nofollow">Bonhams 1793: Fine Art Auctioneers & Valuers</ref> <ref class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100227083936/http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/public.sh/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=EUR&screen=aboutus" rel="nofollow">Archived</ref> February 27, 2010, at the <ref target="/wiki/Wayback_Machine" title="Wayback Machine">Wayback Machine</ref>

<ref target="#cite_ref-56">^</ref> Victims of kidnapping included: Deputy Joe Johns on August 14, 1932; Officer Thomas Persell on January 26, 1933; civilians Dillard Darby and Sophia Stone on April 27, 1933; Sheriff George Corry and Chief Paul Hardy on June 10, 1933; Chief Percy Boyd on April 6, 1934.

<ref target="#cite_ref-60">^</ref> Blanche wrote that she felt "all my hopes and dreams tumbling down around me" as they fled Joplin.

<ref target="#cite_ref-63">^</ref> Barrow's sister Marie described her brother Buck as "the meanest, most hot-tempered" of all her siblings. Phillips, p. 343 n20

<ref target="#cite_ref-68">^</ref> Six witnesses at a farmhouse described battery acid as the culprit; the open-fire story started with the Parker-Cowan-Fortune book; it was repeated in Jones' Playboy interview.

<ref target="#cite_ref-77">^</ref> The gang had many coins because they had broken into the gumball machines at the three service stations that they robbed in <ref target="/wiki/Fort_Dodge,_Iowa" title="Fort Dodge, Iowa">Fort Dodge, Iowa</ref>, earlier that day. Guinn, pp. 210–11

<ref target="#cite_ref-79">^</ref> Sources are split on this; most say that it was Blanche who went to town, but she recounted it as Clyde and Jones; p. 112

<ref target="#cite_ref-83">^</ref> The armored car was an ordinary automobile that had been fortified with panels of extra boilerplate.

<ref target="#cite_ref-88">^</ref> Guinn writes that their clothes were so bloody after Dexfield that they wore sheets with slits cut for their heads.

<ref target="#cite_ref-90">^</ref> Knight and Davis had a different version, but once they split up, Jones never saw Barrow and Parker again. Knight and Davis, pp. 114–15

<ref target="#cite_ref-93">^</ref> Phillips writes that Barrow had been so focused on this for so long that, after the Eastham raid, "life for Clyde Barrow became anticlimactic…only death remained, and he knew it". Phillips, Running, p. 217.

<ref target="#cite_ref-147">^</ref> But the cigar is shown in other photos from the Joplin rolls shot at the same spot. (Ramsey, pp. 108–09)

<ref target="#cite_ref-150">^</ref> Hamer was interested in the Barrow hunt assignment, but the pay was only a third of what he made working for oil companies. To sweeten the deal, Texas Department of Corrections boss Lee Simmons granted him title to all the guns that the posse would recover from the slain murderers. Almost all the guns, which the gang had stolen from armories, were the property of the National Guard. There was a thriving market for "celebrity" guns, even in 1934 (Guinn, p. 343).

<ref target="#cite_ref-157">^</ref> The engine still ran, despite the battering which it took in the ambush. After Jordan conceded ownership of the vehicle, Mrs Warren arrived in Arcadia to claim it and then drove it to Shreveport, still in its gruesome state. From there, she had it trucked back to Topeka. (Ramsey, p. 272) The car was most recently on display in Terrible's Gold Ranch Casino in <ref target="/wiki/Verdi,_Nevada" title="Verdi, Nevada">Verdi, Nevada</ref>.
