<p>Design for Living is a comedy play written by <ref target="/wiki/No%C3%ABl_Coward" title="Noël Coward">Noël Coward</ref> in 1932. It concerns a trio of artistic characters, Gilda, Otto and Leo, and their complicated three-way relationship. Originally written to star <ref target="/wiki/Lynn_Fontanne" title="Lynn Fontanne">Lynn Fontanne</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Alfred_Lunt" title="Alfred Lunt">Alfred Lunt</ref> and Coward, it was premiered on Broadway, partly because its risqué subject matter was thought unacceptable to the <ref target="/wiki/Lord_Chamberlain%27s_Office" title="Lord Chamberlain's Office">official censor</ref> in London. It was not until 1939 that a London production was presented.</p>
<p>Design for Living was a success on Broadway in 1933, but it has been revived less often than Coward's other major comedies. Coward said, "it was liked and disliked, and hated and admired, but never, I think, sufficiently loved by any but its three leading actors."<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref> The play was adapted into <ref target="/wiki/Design_for_Living_(film)" title="Design for Living (film)">a film</ref> in 1933, directed by <ref target="/wiki/Ernst_Lubitsch" title="Ernst Lubitsch">Ernst Lubitsch</ref>, with a screenplay by <ref target="/wiki/Ben_Hecht" title="Ben Hecht">Ben Hecht</ref>, and starring <ref target="/wiki/Fredric_March" title="Fredric March">Fredric March</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary Cooper</ref>, and <ref target="/wiki/Miriam_Hopkins" title="Miriam Hopkins">Miriam Hopkins</ref>. It first played in London in 1939 and has enjoyed a number of stage revivals.</p>

<h2>History[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Design_for_Living&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: History">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Coward had known Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne since his first trip to New York in 1921, when he was penniless, and they were scarcely better off. Dreaming of future stardom, they resolved that when all three were famous, Coward would write a play for them all to star in.<ref target="#cite_note-lahr73-2">[2]</ref> In the following decade, Coward became one of the world's most famous playwrights, with a succession of popular hits.<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> These ranged from the <ref target="/wiki/Operetta" title="Operetta">operetta</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Bitter_Sweet" title="Bitter Sweet">Bitter Sweet</ref> (1929) and the extravaganza <ref target="/wiki/Cavalcade_(play)" title="Cavalcade (play)">Cavalcade</ref> (1931), to the intimate comedies <ref target="/wiki/Hay_Fever_(play)" title="Hay Fever (play)">Hay Fever</ref> (1924) and <ref target="/wiki/Private_Lives" title="Private Lives">Private Lives</ref> (1930). Lunt and Fontanne too had achieved fame, and by the early 1930s the time was right for Coward to write their star vehicle.<ref target="#cite_note-Coward-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>The Lunts' marriage was devoted and long-lived, but there were triangular relationships in their private lives which Coward could draw on for his plot.<ref target="#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> Coward recorded that while he was refining his original ideas for the play, "Alfred had suggested a few stage directions which if followed faithfully, would undoubtedly have landed all three of us in gaol".<ref target="#cite_note-Coward-4">[4]</ref> Of the three principal characters, Coward later commented,</p>

<p>.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}"These glib, over-articulate and amoral creatures force their lives into fantastic shapes and problems because they cannot help themselves. Impelled chiefly by the impact of their personalities each upon the other, they are like moths in a pool of light, unable to tolerate the lonely outer darkness but equally unable to share the light without colliding constantly and bruising each other's wings.... The ending of the play is equivocal. The three of them... are left together as the curtain falls, laughing.... Some saw it as the lascivious anticipation of a sort of a carnal frolic. Others with less ribald imaginations regarded it as a meaningless and slightly inept excuse to bring the curtain down. I as author, however, prefer to think that Gilda and Otto and Leo were laughing at themselves."<ref target="#cite_note-Coward-4">[4]</ref></p>

<h3>Original production[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Design_for_Living&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Original production">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Design for Living previewed in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cleveland,_Ohio" title="Cleveland, Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</ref> on 2 January 1933 and opened in New York on 24 January, at the <ref target="/wiki/Ethel_Barrymore_Theatre" title="Ethel Barrymore Theatre">Ethel Barrymore Theatre</ref> on Broadway to popular and critical acclaim. In <ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Brooks_Atkinson" title="Brooks Atkinson">Brooks Atkinson</ref> described it as a play of "skill, art and clairvoyance, performed by an incomparable trio of comedians. ... Miss Fontanne with her slow, languorous deliberation, Mr Lunt with his boyish enthusiasm, Mr Coward with his biting, nervous clarity. ... Skill, art, even erudition of a sort have gone into this gay bit of drollery."<ref target="#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> The New York Sun called it "as happy a spectacle of surface skating as one might see," adding that the skaters were "sometimes on very thin ice."<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> For the opening night, the price of tickets more than quintupled, and the three stars were reported to be receiving record salaries for a Broadway production.<ref target="#cite_note-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>Design for Living was such a success that Coward was prevailed upon to relax his usual rule against appearing in any production for more than three months, and he allowed the play to run for a total of five months. So great were the crowds of fans in the street that special police had to be called in during the last week of the run.<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> The notoriety of the play inspired a Broadway parody, "Life Begins at 8:40", sung by Louella Gear, <ref target="/wiki/Ray_Bolger" title="Ray Bolger">Ray Bolger</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Bert_Lahr" title="Bert Lahr">Bert Lahr</ref>:</p>


<p>Night and day, ma chérie,</p>
<p>Me for you, and you and you for me.</p>
<p>We're living in the smart upper sets.</p>
<p>Let other lovers sing their duets.</p>
<p>Duets are made for the bourgeoisie – oh</p>
<p>But only God can make a trio.<ref target="#cite_note-lahr73-2">[2]</ref></p>

<h3>Revivals[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Design_for_Living&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Revivals">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The first London production of Design for Living opened at the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Haymarket_Theatre" title="Haymarket Theatre">Haymarket Theatre</ref> on 25 January 1939, later transferring to the <ref target="/wiki/Savoy_Theatre" title="Savoy Theatre">Savoy Theatre</ref>, and running for 233 performances. The run was cut short by the outbreak of <ref target="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</ref>. Gilda was played by <ref target="/wiki/Diana_Wynyard" title="Diana Wynyard">Diana Wynyard</ref>, Otto by <ref target="/wiki/Anton_Walbrook" title="Anton Walbrook">Anton Walbrook</ref> and Leo by <ref target="/wiki/Rex_Harrison" title="Rex Harrison">Rex Harrison</ref>. By the time the play made its delayed debut in London <ref target="/wiki/Ivor_Brown" title="Ivor Brown">Ivor Brown</ref> thought it "very much of its time and already seems a trifle faded. It will not be long before they revive it in costume as a specimen comedy of 'early thirties' manners."<ref target="#cite_note-10">[10]</ref></p>
<p>In 1944 it was performed at the Prince of Wales Theatre in Birmingham from 13 November.</p>
<p>As part of Play of the Week in August 1964 four Coward plays directed and produced by <ref target="/wiki/Joan_Kemp-Welch" title="Joan Kemp-Welch">Joan Kemp-Welch</ref> were transmitted on ITV, including Design for Living with <ref target="/wiki/Jill_Bennett_(British_actress)" title="Jill Bennett (British actress)">Jill Bennett</ref> as Gilda, <ref target="/wiki/Daniel_Massey_(actor)" title="Daniel Massey (actor)">Daniel Massey</ref> as Leo, and <ref target="/wiki/John_Wood_(English_actor)" title="John Wood (English actor)">John Wood</ref> as Otto.<ref target="#cite_note-11">[11]</ref></p>
<p>The first major revival was at the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phoenix_Theatre_(London)" title="Phoenix Theatre (London)">Phoenix Theatre</ref>, London, shortly after Coward's death in 1973. <ref target="/wiki/Vanessa_Redgrave" title="Vanessa Redgrave">Vanessa Redgrave</ref> played Gilda, with <ref target="/wiki/John_Stride" title="John Stride">John Stride</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Jeremy_Brett" title="Jeremy Brett">Jeremy Brett</ref> as Otto and Leo.<ref target="#cite_note-12">[12]</ref> In 1982, at the <ref target="/wiki/Gielgud_Theatre" title="Gielgud Theatre">Globe Theatre</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Maria_Aitken" title="Maria Aitken">Maria Aitken</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Gary_Bond" title="Gary Bond">Gary Bond</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Ian_Ogilvy" title="Ian Ogilvy">Ian Ogilvy</ref> played the lead roles.</p>
<p>The first Broadway revival was in 1984 at Circle in the Square Theater, directed by <ref target="/wiki/George_C._Scott" title="George C. Scott">George C. Scott</ref>, starring <ref target="/wiki/Jill_Clayburgh" title="Jill Clayburgh">Jill Clayburgh</ref> as Gilda, <ref target="/wiki/Raul_Julia" title="Raul Julia">Raul Julia</ref> as Leo and <ref target="/wiki/Frank_Langella" title="Frank Langella">Frank Langella</ref> as Otto.<ref target="#cite_note-13">[13]</ref></p>
<p>A 1994 revival of the play directed by <ref target="/wiki/Sean_Mathias" title="Sean Mathias">Sean Mathias</ref> at the <ref target="/wiki/Donmar_Warehouse" title="Donmar Warehouse">Donmar Warehouse</ref> theatre emphasised the sexual overtones of the play. Though the Coward estate has been wary of radical reinterpretations of the plays, the author's partner, <ref target="/wiki/Graham_Payn" title="Graham Payn">Graham Payn</ref>, attended at least one performance. The production featured <ref target="/wiki/Rachel_Weisz" title="Rachel Weisz">Rachel Weisz</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Paul_Rhys" title="Paul Rhys">Paul Rhys</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Clive_Owen" title="Clive Owen">Clive Owen</ref>.

<p>A 2001 Broadway revival was directed by <ref target="/wiki/Joe_Mantello" title="Joe Mantello">Joe Mantello</ref> and starred <ref target="/wiki/Alan_Cumming" title="Alan Cumming">Alan Cumming</ref> as Otto, <ref target="/wiki/Jennifer_Ehle" title="Jennifer Ehle">Jennifer Ehle</ref> as Gilda and <ref target="/wiki/Dominic_West" title="Dominic West">Dominic West</ref> as Leo. </p>

<h2>Plot[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Design_for_Living&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Plot">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Act I[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Design_for_Living&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Act I">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Otto's "rather shabby" studio in Paris, 1932</p>
<p>Gilda is an interior designer who lives with the painter Otto, who was previously attached to Leo, an author. She is visited by Ernest Friedman, an art dealer and friend of all three. He is excited about his newly acquired <ref target="/wiki/Henri_Matisse" title="Henri Matisse">Matisse</ref> and wants to show it to Otto. Gilda says that Otto is in bed, ill, and cannot be disturbed. Ernest tells her that Leo is back in Paris after making a success in New York. Otto enters from the street, carrying luggage, and very clearly not bedridden as Gilda has told Ernest. Ernest prudently takes his leave. After he and Otto have gone out to find Leo, supposedly at the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hotel_George_V,_Paris" title="Hotel George V, Paris">George V Hotel</ref>, Leo enters from Gilda's bedroom where he has spent the night with her. They discuss what they should say to Otto, whom they both love. On his return they tell him that they have slept together in his absence, and after a furious row he renounces both of them and storms out of the room.</p>

<h3>Act II[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Design_for_Living&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Act II">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Leo's flat in London eighteen months later</p>
<p>Scene 1</p>
<p>Leo and Gilda are now living together. His plays are now immensely successful. A journalist and press photographer call to do a feature on him. During the interview Leo makes several remarks that show how shallow he finds success.</p>

<p>Scene 2</p>
<p>A few days later, Leo is away, and Otto turns up. He too has now become successful. Otto and Gilda dine together and their old love is rekindled. They embrace passionately.</p>
<p>Scene 3</p>
<p>The next morning, Otto is still asleep when Ernest calls on Gilda. She tells him she is leaving Leo, and they exit together. Leo returns to discover Otto, who at once acknowledges that he has spent the night with Gilda. Before the ensuing row develops too far they spot the notes Gilda has left for them both. They are both horrified that she has gone, and they drown their sorrows in brandy and then sherry. They embrace, sobbing helplessly.</p>

<h3>Act III[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Design_for_Living&action=edit&section=7" title="Edit section: Act III">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Ernest's penthouse in New York, two years later.</p>
<p>Scene 1</p>
<p>Gilda has married Ernest and become a commercially successful designer. Ernest is away, and Gilda is giving a reception for some important clients. It is gatecrashed by Otto and Leo, in impeccable evening dress, determined to reclaim her. They frighten her guests into leaving, and Gilda pretends to bid them goodnight along with her other guests, but secretly gives them a key and tells them to return later.</p>

<p>Scene 2</p>
<p>Ernest returns the next morning to find Otto and Leo in his apartment, wearing his pyjamas. Gilda, however, has not been there. She has been to a hotel overnight to allow herself time to think. When she returns, Otto and Leo explain to an incredulous and incandescent Ernest that Gilda's formal status as his wife is irrelevant. She slowly realises that the attraction the two exert for her is irresistible. As Ernest rushes out denouncing their "disgusting three-sided erotic hotch-potch," Gilda, Otto and Leo fall together on a sofa in gales of laughter.<ref target="#cite_note-18">[18]</ref></p>

<h2>1933 film[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Design_for_Living&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: 1933 film">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Main article: <ref target="/wiki/Design_for_Living_(film)" title="Design for Living (film)">Design for Living (film)</ref></p>
<p>The play was adapted into a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pre-Code" title="Pre-Code">pre-Hays code</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Comedy_film" title="Comedy film">comedy film</ref> in 1933, directed by <ref target="/wiki/Ernst_Lubitsch" title="Ernst Lubitsch">Ernst Lubitsch</ref>, with a screenplay by <ref target="/wiki/Ben_Hecht" title="Ben Hecht">Ben Hecht</ref>, starring <ref target="/wiki/Fredric_March" title="Fredric March">Fredric March</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary Cooper</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Miriam_Hopkins" title="Miriam Hopkins">Miriam Hopkins</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Edward_Everett_Horton" title="Edward Everett Horton">Edward Everett Horton</ref>. Coward said of the film adaptation, "I'm told that there are three of my original lines left in the film – such original ones as 'Pass the mustard'."<ref target="#cite_note-19">[19]</ref> The film's plot was as follows:</p>
<p>In Paris, Americans, playwright Tom Chambers and artist George Curtis, both fall in love with Gilda, an American commercial artist. She cannot make up her mind which man she loves, so the three decide to live together platonically. At first, the three are friends, but as time goes by, the two men become more competitive. Gilda decides to end the dispute by marrying her employer, Max Plunkett, but finds the marriage dull and stifling. After Tom and George crash a party at the Plunkett mansion, Gilda returns to the two men, and Max agrees to a divorce.</p>
