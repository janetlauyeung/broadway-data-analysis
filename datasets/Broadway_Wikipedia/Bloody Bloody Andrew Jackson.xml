<h2>Synopsis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Bloody_Bloody_Andrew_Jackson&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Synopsis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The show opens when the cast, dressed as 19th-century American cowboys and prostitutes take the stage. They are led by <ref target="/wiki/Andrew_Jackson" title="Andrew Jackson">Andrew Jackson</ref>. They sing about their eagerness to strip the English, Spanish, French, and, most importantly, the <ref target="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native Americans</ref>, of their land in the <ref target="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">US</ref>. Along with this, they sing of the desire to bring political power back to the public and away from the elite ("Populism Yea Yea").</p>
<p>Jackson's childhood is shown in the <ref target="/wiki/Tennessee" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</ref> hills during the late 18th century. His family and the local shoe cobbler die of cholera and in Indian attacks. This leads him to join the military, where he is imprisoned by the British. Jackson begins to express his disdain for the US government’s lack of involvement with the people of the frontier and how he wishes someone would stand up to them ("I'm Not That Guy").</p>
<p>Jackson is then shown as a young adult, regaling local tavern goers with his short meeting with <ref target="/wiki/George_Washington" title="George Washington">George Washington</ref>. He is interrupted and attacked by several Spaniards. Jackson defeats them, but is injured in the process. A woman named <ref target="/wiki/Rachel_Jackson" title="Rachel Jackson">Rachel</ref> helps him to recover from his injuries. They fall in love during his recovery and eventually marry, though Rachel is not yet divorced from her current husband ("Illness as Metaphor"). At the end of the song, news comes that British, Indian, and Spanish forces are making advances into American territory. Meanwhile, the US government continues to do nothing to stop the attacks. Jackson realizes that if he wants this cycle to end, he must change things himself ("I'm So That Guy").</p>
<p>Jackson organizes a militia to remove Indian Tribes throughout the Southeast both by force and negotiation ("Ten Little Indians"). In the aftermath of a battle, he adopts a young Native American child named <ref target="/wiki/Lyncoya_Jackson" title="Lyncoya Jackson">Lyncoya</ref>. <ref target="/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams" title="John Quincy Adams">John Quincy Adams</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Henry_Clay" title="Henry Clay">Henry Clay</ref>, <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/John_Calhoun" title="John Calhoun">John Calhoun</ref>, and <ref target="/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren" title="Martin Van Buren">Martin Van Buren</ref> are introduced as they express their concern over Jackson's unauthorized territorial expansion. Jackson rebuffs their pleas, explaining how he has driven out the French and the Spanish, while acquiring more land than <ref target="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</ref>.</p>
<p>The <ref target="/wiki/Battle_of_New_Orleans" title="Battle of New Orleans">Battle of New Orleans</ref> transforms Jackson into a national hero. He becomes Governor of Florida and decides to run for United States President in 1824. Although he receives the most popular and <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)" title="Electoral College (United States)">Electoral votes</ref>, he is not elected President, due to the political maneuvering in the <ref target="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="United States House of Representatives">House of Representatives</ref>. ("<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Corrupt_Bargain" title="Corrupt Bargain">The Corrupt Bargain</ref>"). Jackson spends the four years after the election at his home, <ref target="/wiki/The_Hermitage_(Nashville,_Tennessee)" title="The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)">The Hermitage</ref>. He returns from political exile and forms the <ref target="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party</ref>. During the presidential election of 1828, Andrew Jackson becomes a surprise candidate ("Rock Star"). This is grueling both publicly and personally to Jackson and his family. Rachel, feeling as if she has no private life, questions Andrew's love for her versus the American People ("The Great Compromise").</p>
<p>Days before the election, a <ref target="/wiki/United_States_Senate" title="United States Senate">Senate</ref> panel led by <ref target="/wiki/Henry_Clay" title="Henry Clay">Clay</ref> investigates Jackson's past wrongdoings and accuses Rachel of bigamy. Despite this, Jackson ends up winning the election and becomes the 7th President of the United States. However, the accusation of his rivals, along with the stress of the election, leads to Rachel dying of grief. He vows to use both his presidency and his wife's death as a mandate to "take this country back" ("Public Life").</p>
<p>Once in office, Jackson is faced with a plethora of problems, ranging from the <ref target="/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States" title="Second Bank of the United States">National Bank</ref> to questions about Indian relocation. Being the “People’s President,” Jackson begins polling the American populace on all executive decisions. This draws the ire of Congress and the <ref target="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</ref>. In response, Jackson consolidates <ref target="/wiki/Executive_(government)" title="Executive (government)">Executive Power</ref>, thus making the Presidency more powerful than <ref target="/wiki/United_States_Congress" title="United States Congress">Congress</ref> and the Courts. At first, his exhilarating cowboy-like governing tactics are met with great enthusiasm by the average citizen. But, as the problems grow tougher, the public begins to resent being asked to make difficult decisions ("Crisis Averted").</p>
<p>As the American people gradually turn on him, Jackson takes stock of all that he has lost: his family, his wife, and now the love of the American public. He decides he must take ultimate responsibility for the nation's choices and declares that he alone will be the one to make the unenviable policy decisions regarding the Indians' fate ("The Saddest Song"). He summons Black Fox—an Indian Chief who organized the remaining Indian tribes into a confederation against Tennessee settlers—in order to make one last deal with the Native Americans still living in American Territories. Jackson implores Black Fox to peacefully move his people west of the <ref target="/wiki/Mississippi_River" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</ref>. Black Fox asks for time to consult his tribe. But, Jackson violently snaps and decrees that federal troops will forcibly move the Indians West.</p>
<p>Near the end, the musical reviews Jackson's legacy and the views attributed to him. Some believe he was one of America's greatest presidents, while others believe him to be an “American <ref target="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</ref>.” The final scene shows Jackson receiving an honorary doctorate at Harvard. He reflects upon his achievements and his questionable decisions. The show telescopes out and we get a bird's-eye view of Jackson's damning legacy and our collective culpability ("Second Nature").</p>
<p>Finally, the company gathers to sing "<ref target="/wiki/The_Hunters_of_Kentucky" title="The Hunters of Kentucky">The Hunters of Kentucky</ref>," before taking their bows.</p>
