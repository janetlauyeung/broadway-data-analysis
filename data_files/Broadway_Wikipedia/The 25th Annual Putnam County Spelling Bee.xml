<p>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee is a <ref target="/wiki/Musical_theatre" title="Musical theatre">musical</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Comedy" title="Comedy">comedy</ref> with music and lyrics by <ref target="/wiki/William_Finn" title="William Finn">William Finn</ref>, a book by Rachel Sheinkin, conceived by Rebecca Feldman with additional material by Jay Reiss. The show centers on a fictional <ref target="/wiki/Spelling_bee" title="Spelling bee">spelling bee</ref> set in a geographically ambiguous Putnam Valley Middle School. Six quirky adolescents compete in the Bee, run by three equally quirky grown-ups.</p>
<p>The 2005 <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref> production, directed by <ref target="/wiki/James_Lapine" title="James Lapine">James Lapine</ref> and produced by <ref target="/wiki/David_Stone_(producer)" title="David Stone (producer)">David Stone</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/James_L._Nederlander" title="James L. Nederlander">James L. Nederlander</ref>, Barbara Whitman, Patrick Catullo, Barrington Stage Company and Second Stage Theater, earned good reviews and box-office success and was nominated for six <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Award" title="Tony Award">Tony Awards</ref>, winning two, including Best Book. The show has spawned various other productions in the United States, and other countries.</p>
<p>An unusual aspect of the show is that four real <ref target="/wiki/Audience" title="Audience">audience</ref> members are invited on stage to compete in the spelling bee alongside the six young characters. During the 2005 <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tony_Awards" title="Tony Awards">Tony Awards</ref>, former Presidential candidate <ref target="/wiki/Al_Sharpton" title="Al Sharpton">Al Sharpton</ref> competed. Another amusing aspect of the show is that the official pronouncer, usually an <ref target="/wiki/Improvisational_theatre" title="Improvisational theatre">improv comedian</ref>, provides ridiculous usage-in-a-sentence examples when asked to use words in a sentence. For instance, for the word "<ref target="/wiki/Palaestra" title="Palaestra">palaestra</ref>", he says, "<ref target="/wiki/Euripides" title="Euripides">Euripides</ref> said, 'What happens at the palaestra stays at the palaestra.'"[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>] At some shows, adult-only audiences (over age 16) are invited for "Parent-Teacher Conferences," also known as "adult night at the Bee." These performances are peppered with sexual references and profanity inspired by R-rated ad-libs made during rehearsals.</p>
<p>The Broadway <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cast_album" title="Cast album">cast album</ref> was released on May 31, 2005 and is available from <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ghostlight_Records" title="Ghostlight Records">Ghostlight Records</ref>, an imprint of <ref target="/wiki/Sh-K-Boom_Records" title="Sh-K-Boom Records">Sh-K-Boom Records</ref>. The original Broadway cast recording was nominated for a <ref target="/wiki/Grammy_Award" title="Grammy Award">Grammy Award</ref>.</p>

<h2>Background and original productions[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_25th_Annual_Putnam_County_Spelling_Bee&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Background and original productions">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The musical was based upon C-R-E-P-U-S-C-U-L-E, an original improvisational play created by Rebecca Feldman and performed by The Farm, a New-York-based improvisational comedy troupe. <ref target="/wiki/Sarah_Saltzberg" title="Sarah Saltzberg">Sarah Saltzberg</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Wendy_Wasserstein" title="Wendy Wasserstein">Wendy Wasserstein</ref>'s weekend nanny, was in the original production, and Wasserstein recommended that Finn see the show. Finn brought Rachel Sheinkin on board, and they worked together with Feldman to transform "C-R-E-P-U-S-C-U-L-E" into a scripted full-length musical.</p>
<p>Spelling Bee was workshopped and developed at the <ref target="/wiki/Barrington_Stage_Company" title="Barrington Stage Company">Barrington Stage Company</ref> (BSC), <ref target="/wiki/Massachusetts" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</ref>, where <ref target="/wiki/Julianne_Boyd" title="Julianne Boyd">Julianne Boyd</ref> is the Artistic Director, in two different stages. In February 2004, a workshop was done in which a first act and parts of a second act were created – this stage of the process was directed by Michael Barakiva and Feldman. The script was fleshed out and the show was given a fuller production in July 2004, directed by Feldman and Michael Unger.<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-off-2">[2]</ref> Dan Knechtges choreographed the workshop, summer productions, and the Broadway production.

<p>The musical begins with Rona Lisa Peretti entering the gymnasium to set up. As she passes by the microphone, she has a <ref target="/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)" title="Flashback (narrative)">flashback</ref> to the moment when she won the third annual spelling bee by correctly spelling syzygy. The spellers are introduced as they enter, and sing about their anticipation of the bee ("The Twenty-Fifth Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee"). Rona then welcomes the audience to the bee, and calls the selected 4 audience spellers to the stage. She also speaks privately to Olive Ostrovsky, who has not yet paid the entrance fee of twenty-five dollars. When asked if she has a parent in the audience who can pay, Olive reveals that she has arrived by herself on the bus. Rona decides to let the fee slide for the moment. She then introduces the official word pronouncer, Douglas Panch, who is returning from a five-year hiatus. Panch alludes to an incident five years ago, but declares that he is in a better place now. Panch introduces the intimidating-looking comfort counselor, Mitch Mahoney, who is helping at the Bee as part of his court-mandated community service. Mahoney leads the spellers (now including the audience volunteers) in the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance_(United_States)" title="Pledge of Allegiance (United States)">Pledge of Allegiance</ref>. Panch then explains the rules of the spelling bee ("The Spelling Rules / My Favorite Moment of the Bee 1").</p>
<p>The spelling bee begins and as each non-audience speller is called forward, the audience learns about his or her background through flashbacks (with other characters in the flashbacks being played by the other spellers on stage, including simple nonspeaking roles played by the audience spellers, as guided by the actors).</p>
<p>Logainne Schwartzandgrubenierre is called up first.</p>
<p>When Leaf Coneybear is called to spell the first time, it is revealed in a flashback that he came in third at his regional bee, but advanced to the county finals when the winner and runner-up had to attend the winner's <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bat_Mitzvah" title="Bat Mitzvah">Bat Mitzvah</ref>. His word is <ref target="/wiki/Capybara" title="Capybara">capybara</ref>, which he has no idea how to spell, but he ends up spelling it correctly while in a trance. </p>
<p>Olive is shown to be shy and reserved, a result of her largely absent parents — her mother is in India on a spiritual journey, and her father is missing the bee to work, late as usual. She has come to love spelling by reading the dictionary in her home ("My Friend, the Dictionary").</p>
<p>An audience volunteer is called up, and is given an easy word. If they get it correct, the 2nd volunteer then gets a hard word intended to eliminate them. If the first volunteer gets their word wrong, then the 2nd is given an easy word or not called at all.</p>
<p>When William Barfée is called to spell for the first time, Rona describes his unusual technique — he spells the word out on the ground with his foot to get a visual before speaking it. He demonstrates his confidence by returning to his seat immediately after spelling his word, and responding "I know" when Panch affirms that the spelling is correct.</p>
<p>The 3rd volunteer is given an easy word (often "Mexican"), which the spellers complain about. After several rounds, another particularly easy word is given to the final audience speller (often "cow", "telephone" or "hospital"), and the spellers erupt and rant about how the element of luck makes the bee unfair ("Pandemonium").</p>
<p>Logainne then gets "Cystitis," and is shown studying with her two often-arguing fathers in a flashback.</p>
<p>When Leaf is called the second time, he is given <ref target="/wiki/Acouchi" title="Acouchi">acouchi</ref>, which he again does not know how to spell. He reminisces about how his family repeatedly calls him "dumb", a sentiment that he has come to believe. Again, in a trance, he spells the word correctly ("I'm Not That Smart").</p>
<p>Barfée is called, and this time sings about his technique ("Magic Foot").</p>
<p>When Marcy is called again, she correctly spells an extraordinarily difficult word ("qaimaqam"), proving herself to be the best speller. However, she is genuinely surprised and somewhat hurt when Rona claims that she is "all business".</p>
<p>Chip Tolentino is called next, but he is not paying attention. Rather, he is fantasizing about Leaf's attractive sister, Marigold, in the audience. When snapped out of his daze, he is reluctant to take his turn because he has an erection that is showing. Under threat of disqualification, he takes his turn, but his thoughts (aided by the vaguely erotic word that he is given, tittup) distract him and he begins to misspell the word. He catches himself quickly, and backs up to try to save himself, but the rules of the bee state that "the sequences of letters already spoken may not be changed". He begs for another chance, but Mitch eventually hauls him off ("Pandemonium (Reprise) / My Favorite Moment of the Bee 2").</p>
<p>At this point, the last audience speller is eliminated (he or she simply is called repeatedly in succession and given increasingly difficult words). Mitch sings a special serenade to this audience member for making it this far ("Prayer of the Comfort Counselor").</p>
<p>The remaining spellers (all of the normal cast spellers except for Chip) and the adults go on break, and Chip passes through the audience selling snacks, the punishment for being the first eliminated. He explains to the audience why he lost ("My Unfortunate Erection (Chip's Lament)"). Barfée taunts Chip, who throws a bag of peanuts <ref target="/wiki/M%26M%27s" title="M&M's">M&M's</ref> at him. Barfée is allergic to peanuts, so Olive picks them up for him. Chip and Barfée continue to fight before Rona escorts the former offstage. Olive and Barfée converse awkwardly before the second half of the bee begins, and Barfée begins to develop a crush on Olive.</p>
<p>With the break over, Rona introduces the finalists as they reenter. Last to be introduced is Logainne, who describes her two overbearing fathers and the stress that they put on her ("Woe is Me"). In a montage sequence, the bee is shown progressing through many rounds, ending with Leaf’s elimination on the word <ref target="/wiki/Chinchilla" title="Chinchilla">chinchilla</ref>. He walks away head held high, having proven to himself, despite his elimination, that he is smart (I'm Not that Smart (Reprise)").</p>
<p>Marcy is called to spell, and Rona, who has been announcing factoids about the spellers all along, announces that Marcy speaks five languages. Marcy reveals more about her stressful life, where she is pushed to succeed in everything, which she does not enjoy ("I Speak Six Languages"). She is given the word <ref target="/wiki/Camouflage" title="Camouflage">camouflage</ref>, to which she sighs, "Dear Jesus, can't you come up with a harder word than that?" Jesus then appears to her and teaches her that she is in control of her own life. Resolved to do what she wants rather than what is expected of her, she intentionally misspells the word and exits excitedly ("Jesus / Pandemonium (Reprise #2)").</p>
<p>Olive's cellphone rings — it is her father, who she has been anxiously hoping would arrive. Panch attempts to disallow her from answering the phone, but she persuades Rona to take the call for her. Logainne then begins an ad-libbed rant about the bee, her fathers, and current political events. Panch, provoked by the rant and upset that he has lost control over the bee, loses his temper and lashes out at Logainne, who is next up to spell. Panch is then escorted offstage by Rona and Mitch (different productions handle this differently). One of Logainne's fathers jumps onstage to calm Logainne down, and, despite his daughter's protests, pours some of his soda on the floor to make Barfée's foot stick and thus disrupt his technique.</p>
<p>With Panch calmed down, Olive is called to spell. She asks what her father had said, and is saddened to learn that he said he is running even later than planned. Her word is chimerical, and mirroring the word's definition, she imagines her parents being there and giving her the love that she always has wanted and yearned for, while showing the problems with her own family ("The I Love You Song").</p>
<p>Barfée is called to spell next, and when he uses his signature technique, the soda causes his foot to stick. Much to his surprise, he is able to spell his word correctly anyway. Logainne is next, and she overcomplicates her word <ref target="/wiki/Vug" title="Vug">vug</ref> and misspells it ("Woe is Me (Reprise)"). Rona is excited that it has come down to the final two ("My Favorite Moment of the Bee 3").</p>
<p>The finals are shown through another montage ("Second"), and Olive and Barfée continue to grow closer. Eventually, Olive misspells a word (elanguescence), giving Barfée a chance to win by spelling his next word correctly. He is torn between winning and letting Olive win, but with Olive's encouragement, he spells his word correctly (<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Weltanschauung" title="Weltanschauung">Weltanschauung</ref>). Panch awards William Morris Barfée the trophy and two hundred dollar prize, and in a surprise act of charity, gives Olive a fictitious runner-up prize of twenty-five dollars from his own pocket — exactly the amount needed to cover her entrance fee. Olive congratulates and hugs Barfée, and each character reads their epilogue, a sentence or two about what they do in the years and decades after the main action of the play ends ("Finale").</p>

<p>† Not featured on the cast album</p>
<p>‡ Combined into one track on the cast album</p>
<p>There is a song on the cast album, called "Why We Like Spelling". This song is sung by all the spellers, but is not in the Broadway production or in the licensed productions.</p>
<p>A song entitled "The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee Massacres the 12 Days of Christmas" was released online as a holiday track sung by the cast. It reveals several different instances of events within the lives of the characters, such as Coneybear being given 2 right socks named "Phil", Olive discussing various places her dad forgets her at, Barfée ruling his sea anemone circus from his basement, Panch's urine laced with Ritalin, Rona's most recent boyfriend breaking up with her, Mitch ending up and making calls from prison, Schwarzy explaining her dads giving her stomach ulcers, Chip playing with his little league baseball team, and Marcy receiving the 7th book of Moses (which Schwarzy repeatedly objects to, claiming there's only 5) while fighting with her understudy who was taking her place because "Deborah [S. Craig, the regular Marcy actress] hurt her knee".</p>

<h2>Characters[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_25th_Annual_Putnam_County_Spelling_Bee&action=edit&section=7" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Major characters</p>
<p>Rona Lisa Peretti: The number-one <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Realtor" title="Realtor">realtor</ref> in Putnam County, a former Putnam County Spelling Bee Champion herself, and returning moderator. She is a sweet woman who loves children, but she can be very stern when it comes to dealing with Vice Principal Panch, who has feelings for her that she most likely does not return. It is implied that she sees much of herself in Olive Ostrovsky. Her favorite moment of the Bee is in the minutes before it starts, when all the children are filled with the joy of competition, before they begin to resent each other. She later declares that she likes how everyone has an equal chance of winning, citing as an example that last year's winner can be this year's loser and <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases:_V" title="List of Latin phrases: V">vice versa</ref>. Another favorite moment is when the last winners go head to head for the top spot because it is so suspenseful and filled with hope. Ms. Peretti herself won the Third Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee by spelling "<ref class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/syzygy" title="wikt:syzygy">syzygy</ref>", which she recounts at the very beginning of the opening number.</p>
<p>Vice Principal Douglas Panch: After five years' absence from the Bee, Panch returns as judge. There was an "incident" at the Twentieth Annual Bee, but he claims to be in "a better place" now (or so we think), thanks to a high-fiber diet and <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jungian_analysis" title="Jungian analysis">Jungian analysis</ref>. He is infatuated with Rona Lisa Peretti, but she does not return his affections.</p>
<p>Mitch Mahoney: The Official Comfort Counselor. An ex-convict, Mitch is performing his community service with the Bee, and hands out juice boxes to losing students.</p>
<p>Olive Ostrovsky: A young newcomer to competitive spelling. Her mother is in an <ref target="/wiki/Ashram" title="Ashram">ashram</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/India" title="India">India</ref>, and her father is working late, as usual, but he is trying to come sometime during the bee. She made friends with her dictionary at a very young age, helping her to make it to the competition.</p>
<p>William Morris Barfée: A Putnam County Spelling Bee finalist last year, he was eliminated because of an allergic reaction to peanuts. His famous “Magic Foot” method of spelling has boosted him to spelling glory, even though he only has one working nostril and a touchy personality. He has an often-mispronounced last name: it is Bar-FAY, not BARF-ee ("there's an accent <ref target="/wiki/Acute_accent" title="Acute accent">aigu</ref>", he explains with some hostility). He develops a crush on Olive. At the end of the play he wins the spelling bee.</p>
<p>Logainne "Schwarzy" SchwartzandGrubenierre: Logainne is the youngest and most politically aware speller, often making comments about current political figures, with two overbearing <ref target="/wiki/Gay" title="Gay">gay</ref> fathers pushing her to win at any cost. She is somewhat of a neat freak, speaks with a lisp, and knows she'll return to the bee next year.</p>
<p>Marcy Park: A recent transfer from <ref target="/wiki/Virginia" title="Virginia">Virginia</ref>, Marcy placed ninth in last year’s nationals. She speaks six languages, is a member of all-American hockey, a championship rugby player, plays Chopin and Mozart on multiple instruments, sleeps only three hours a night, hides in the bathroom cabinet, and is getting very tired of always winning. She is a total over-achiever, and attends a Catholic school called "Our Lady of Intermittent Sorrows." She is also not allowed to cry.</p>
<p>Leaf Coneybear: A homeschooler and the second runner-up in his district, Leaf gets into the competition on a lark: the winner and first runner-up had to go to the winner’s <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bat_Mitzvah" title="Bat Mitzvah">Bat Mitzvah</ref>. Leaf comes from a large family of former hippies and makes his own clothes. He spells words correctly while in a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spiritual_possession" title="Spiritual possession">trance</ref>. In his song, "I'm Not That Smart", he sings that his family thinks he is "not that smart," but he insinuates that he is merely easily distracted. Most of the words that he is assigned are <ref target="/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South American</ref> rodents with amusing names.</p>
<p>Charlito "Chip" Tolentino ("Tripp Barrington" in the original workshop, "Isaac 'Chip' Berkowitz" in the Chicago production): A Boy Scout and champion of the Twenty-Fourth Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, he returns to defend his title. Relatively social and athletic, as he plays little league, Chip expects things to come easily but he finds puberty hitting at an inopportune moment.</p>
<p>Three or four spellers from the audience: Audience members are encouraged to sign up to participate before the show, and several are chosen to spell words on stage. In touring productions, local celebrities are sometimes selected.</p>
<p>Minor characters (All can be doubled by the actors playing the major characters)</p>
<p>Carl Grubenierre: One of SchwartzandGrubenierre’s fathers; he has set his heart on his little girl winning the Bee, no matter what he has to do, including sabotaging William’s foot. Usually played by the actor who plays Leaf.</p>
<p>Dan Schwartz: SchwartzandGrubenierre’s other father; he is more laid back and doting than Carl but is still intent on his daughter winning the Bee. Usually played by the actor who plays Mitch.</p>
<p>Leaf's Dad: Doubtful and finds his son annoying and unintelligent. Usually played by the actor who plays Barfée.</p>
<p>Leaf’s Mom: Overprotective and doubtful of her son’s abilities to stand up to the competition. Usually played by the actor who plays Logainne.</p>
<p>Leaf’s Siblings: Not very confident of Leaf’s abilities. Usually played by the remaining spellers (both cast and the volunteer audience spellers).</p>
<p>Olive’s Mom and Dad: She is in India, he is working late, but they appear in Olive’s imagination to encourage her and tell her they love her. Usually played by the actors who play Miss Peretti and Mitch.</p>
<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jesus_Christ" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</ref>: Appears to Marcy in a moment of crisis. Usually played by the actor who plays Chip.

<h2>Audience interaction and words used[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_25th_Annual_Putnam_County_Spelling_Bee&action=edit&section=9" title="Edit section: Audience interaction and words used">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Audience interaction</p>
<p>About half an hour before the show begins, audience members in the lobby are given the chance to sign up to participate in the show as "spellers." The registration form asks for name, occupation, hobbies, description of clothing, spelling ability, and age range. Interviewers look for people with no acting experience, unique names, traits, and backgrounds. The audience participants are taken backstage prior to the show and are shown where to stand when called from the audience and given instruction about what to do when called upon to spell. They are asked to request a definition of each word and its usage in a sentence, and to attempt to spell each word rather than giving up. The final audience member to be eliminated is usually given an exceptionally difficult word they are sure to miss; regardless of the spelling the cast reacts with incredulity at his or her "success," and the next word is "belled" as incorrect before the attempt is completed. During the performance, the actors sitting next to the audience participants periodically whisper hints about when to stand, sit, move in "slow motion," "freeze" or hang on because the seating platform unit is about to spin.</p>
<p>Ms. Peretti calls the spellers to the stage at the beginning of the show, and they are given badges to wear that say "Finalist." As the show proceeds, each one is eliminated with successively more difficult words. The final audience participant to be eliminated is serenaded by Mitch ("Prayer of the Comfort Counselor") on-stage. Mitch also gives each eliminated finalist (both audience members and regular characters) a juice box and a hug.</p>
<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Katharine_Close" title="Katharine Close">Katharine Close</ref>, the 2006 winner of the <ref target="/wiki/Scripps_National_Spelling_Bee" title="Scripps National Spelling Bee">Scripps National Spelling Bee</ref>, was invited to be a contestant at a performance of the show. She was the last speller from the audience to be eliminated and survived fourteen rounds.<ref target="#cite_note-27">[27]</ref>
<p>The musical treats the audience members as if they were the audience at the fictitious spelling bee. For example, the characters single out audience members as their "family" members. For example, Barfée periodically refers to an age-appropriate woman near the stage as "mom." Similarly, Chip is distracted by an attractive female audience member (or male in the adults-only version), contributing to a misspelling. He is the first contestant eliminated and is thus forced to sell snacks in the audience in the manner of the refreshment hawkers at a sports event. Other characters frequently walk through the auditorium among the audience during the show, sometimes integrating the audience into the show and occasionally <ref target="/wiki/Fourth_wall" title="Fourth wall">dropping the "fourth wall"</ref>.</p>

<p>Words used</p>
<p>Examples of words spelled by characters in performances of Spelling Bee include <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Astrobleme" title="Astrobleme">Astrobleme</ref>, Cat, <ref target="/wiki/Dinosaur" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Hasenpfeffer" title="Hasenpfeffer">Hasenpfeffer</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Origami" title="Origami">Origami</ref> (Adult Show), and <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Weltanschauung" title="Weltanschauung">Weltanschauung</ref>. Words spelled by the audience volunteers are often unscripted and sometimes improvised by the cast to gently poke fun at the volunteer speller. Past examples include: <ref target="/wiki/Dystopia" title="Dystopia">Dystopia</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Cenacle" title="Cenacle">Cenacle</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Elephant" title="Elephant">Elephant</ref>, <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hemidemisemiquaver" title="Hemidemisemiquaver">Hemidemisemiquaver</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Homunculus" title="Homunculus">Homunculus</ref>, <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cow" title="Cow">Cow</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Jihad" title="Jihad">Jihad</ref>, <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lysergic_Acid_Diethylamide" title="Lysergic Acid Diethylamide">Lysergic Acid Diethylamide</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Castoreum" title="Castoreum">Castoreum</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Didgeridoo" title="Didgeridoo">Didgeridoo</ref> spelt by <ref target="/wiki/Rolf_Harris" title="Rolf Harris">Rolf Harris</ref>. <ref target="/wiki/Julie_Andrews" title="Julie Andrews">Julie Andrews</ref> missed "<ref target="/wiki/Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" title="Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious">Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</ref>" when she was a guest speller on KIDS night on Broadway, 2007.<ref target="#cite_note-28">[28]</ref></p>

<h2>Critical response[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_25th_Annual_Putnam_County_Spelling_Bee&action=edit&section=10" title="Edit section: Critical response">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Charles Isherwood, in his review of the Broadway production for <ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref>, wrote "Most crucially, the affectionate performances of the six actors burdened with the daunting challenge of inhabiting young souls have not been stretched into grotesque shape by the move to a large theater... William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway. If it occasionally suggests a Saturday morning television cartoon set to music by Stephen Sondheim, that's not inappropriate. And Mr. Finn's more wistful songs provide a nice sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book... Mr. Lapine has sharpened all the musical's elements without betraying its appealing modesty." (NY Times Critics Pick)<ref target="#cite_note-29">[29]</ref></p>
