<p>Pacific Overtures is a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Musical_theater" title="Musical theater">musical</ref> written by <ref target="/wiki/Stephen_Sondheim" title="Stephen Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/John_Weidman" title="John Weidman">John Weidman</ref>. The show is set in <ref target="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</ref> beginning in 1853 and follows the difficult <ref target="/wiki/Westernization" title="Westernization">westernization</ref> of Japan, told from the point of view of the Japanese. In particular, the story focuses on the lives of two friends caught in the change.</p>
<p>Sondheim wrote the score in a quasi-Japanese style of parallel 4ths and no leading tone. He did not use the <ref target="/wiki/Pentatonic_scale" title="Pentatonic scale">pentatonic scale</ref>; the 4th degree of the major scale is represented from the opening number through the finale, as Sondheim found just five pitches too limiting. The music contrasts Japanese contemplation ("There is No Other Way") with Western ingenuousness ("Please Hello") while over the course of the 127 years, Western harmonies, tonality and even lyrics are infused into the score. The score is generally considered to be one of Sondheim's most ambitious and sophisticated efforts.<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>The original <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref> production of Pacific Overtures in 1976 was staged in <ref target="/wiki/Kabuki" title="Kabuki">Kabuki</ref> style, with men playing women's parts and set changes made in full view of the audience by black-clad stagehands. It opened to mixed reviews and closed after six months, despite being nominated for ten <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tony_Awards" title="Tony Awards">Tony Awards</ref>.</p>
<p>Given its unusual casting and production demands, Pacific Overtures remains one of <ref target="/wiki/Stephen_Sondheim" title="Stephen Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim</ref>'s least-performed musicals. The show is occasionally staged by opera companies. The cast requires an abundance of gifted male Asian actors who must play male and female parts. Women join the ensemble for only half of the last song; during the finale, after the lyric: “more surprises next,” 20 women actors join the cast and sing the remaining 1:42 of the show. This creates expensive and challenging casting and thus most regional and community theaters, universities and schools are unable to produce it.</p>
<p>The most recent revival in 2017 at Classic Stage Company, helmed by John Doyle and starring George Takei as The Reciter, featured a cast of only 10 people, 8 men and 2 women. This also featured a revised book by John Weidman that had a running time of 90 minutes (as compared to the previous 2 hour 30 minute original run time).</p>

<h2>Title[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Overtures&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Title">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The title of the work is drawn directly from text in a letter from <ref target="/wiki/Matthew_C._Perry" title="Matthew C. Perry">Admiral Perry</ref> addressed to the Emperor dated July 7, 1853:</p>

<p>"Many of the large ships-of-war destined to visit Japan have not yet arrived in these seas, though they are hourly expected; and the undersigned, as an evidence of his friendly intentions, has brought but four of the smaller ones, designing, should it become necessary, to return to Edo in the ensuing spring with a much larger force. But it is expected that the government of your imperial majesty will render such return unnecessary, by acceding at once to the very reasonable and pacific overtures contained in the President's letter, and which will be further explained by the undersigned on the first fitting occasion."<ref target="#cite_note-PerryLetter-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>In addition to playing on the musical term "overture" and the geographical reference to the Pacific Ocean there is also the irony, revealed as the story unfolds, that these "pacific overtures" to initiate commercial exploitation of the Pacific nation were backed by a none too subtle threat of force.<ref target="#cite_note-PerryLetter-2">[2]</ref></p>

<h2>Plot summary[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Overtures&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Plot summary">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Act I</p>
<p>Conceived as a Japanese playwright's version of an American musical about American influences on Japan, Pacific Overtures opens on July 1853. Since the foreigners were expelled from the island empire, explains the Reciter, elsewhere wars are fought and machines are rumbling, but in Nippon they plant rice, exchange bows and enjoy peace and serenity, and there has been nothing to threaten the changeless cycle of their days ("The Advantages of Floating in the Middle of the Sea"). But President <ref target="/wiki/Millard_Fillmore" title="Millard Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</ref>, determined to open up trade with Japan, has sent Commodore <ref target="/wiki/Matthew_C._Perry" title="Matthew C. Perry">Matthew C. Perry</ref> across the Pacific.</p>
<p>To the consternation of Lord Abe and the Shogun's other Councillors, the stirrings of trouble begin with the appearance of <ref target="/wiki/Nakahama_Manjir%C5%8D" title="Nakahama Manjirō">Manjiro</ref>, a fisherman who had been lost at sea and rescued by Americans. He has returned to Japan and now attempts to warn the authorities of the approaching warships, but is instead arrested for consorting with foreigners. A minor samurai, Kayama Yezaemon, is appointed Prefect of Police at Uraga to drive the Americans away - news which leaves his wife Tamate grief-stricken, since Kayama will certainly fail and both will then have to commit <ref target="/wiki/Seppuku" title="Seppuku">seppuku</ref>. As he leaves, she expresses her feelings in dance as two Observers describe the scene and sing her thoughts and words ("There Is No Other Way"). As a Fisherman, a Thief, and other locals relate the sight of the "Four Black Dragons" roaring through the sea, an extravagant Oriental caricature of the USS Powhatan pulls into harbor. Kayama is sent to meet with the Americans but he is laughed at and rejected as not being important enough. He enlists the aid of Manjiro, the only man in Japan who has dealt with Americans, and disguised as a great lord Manjiro is able to get an answer from them: Commodore Perry must meet the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shogun" title="Shogun">Shogun</ref> within six days or else he will shell the city. Facing this ultimatum, the Shogun refuses to commit himself to an answer and takes to his bed. Exasperated by his indecision and procrastination, his Mother, with elaborate courtesy, poisons him. ("Chrysanthemum Tea").</p>
<p>Kayama devises a plan by which the Americans can be received without technically setting foot on Japanese soil, thanks to a covering of tatami mats and a raised Treaty House, for which he is made Governor of Uraga. He and Manjiro set off for Uraga, forging a bond of friendship through the exchange of "Poems". Kayama has saved Japan, but it is too late to save Tamate: when Kayama arrives at his home, he finds that she is dead, having committed <ref target="/wiki/Seppuku" title="Seppuku">seppuku</ref> after having received no news of Kayama for many days. Already events are moving beyond the control of the old order: the two men pass a Madam instructing her inexperienced Oiran girls in the art of seduction as they prepare for the arrival of the foreign devils ("Welcome to Kanagawa").</p>
<p>Commodore Perry and his men disembark and, on their "March to the Treaty House", demonstrate their goodwill by offering such gifts as two bags of Irish potatoes and a copy of Owen's "Geology of Minnesota". The negotiations themselves are observed through the memories of three who were there: a warrior hidden beneath the floor of the Treaty House who could hear the debates, a young boy who could see the action from his perch in the tree outside, and the boy as an old man recalling that without "Someone In a Tree", a silent watcher, history is incomplete. Initially, it seems as if Kayama has won; the Americans depart in peace. But the barbarian figure of Commodore Perry leaps out to perform a traditional Kabuki "Lion Dance", which ends as a strutting, triumphalist, all-American cakewalk.</p>

<p>Act II</p>
<p>The <ref target="/wiki/Emperor_Meiji" title="Emperor Meiji">child emperor</ref> (portrayed by a puppet manipulated by his advisors) reacts with pleasure to the departure of the Americans, promoting Lord Abe to Shogun, confirming Kayama as Governor of Uraga and raising Manjiro to the rank of Samurai. The crisis appears to have passed, but to the displeasure of Lord Abe the Americans return to request formal trading arrangements. To the tune of a <ref target="/wiki/John_Philip_Sousa" title="John Philip Sousa">Sousa</ref> march, an American ambassador bids "Please Hello" to Japan and is followed by a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/W.S._Gilbert" title="W.S. Gilbert">Gilbertian</ref> British ambassador, a clog-dancing Dutchman, a gloomy Russian and a dandified Frenchman all vying for access to Japan's markets (and all backed up by threatening warships). With this new western threat, the faction of the Lords of the South grow restless. They send a politically charged gift to the Emperor, a storyteller who tells a vivid, allegorical tale of a brave young emperor who frees himself from his cowardly Shogun.</p>
<p>Fifteen years pass as Kayama and Manjiro dress themselves for tea. As Manjiro continues to dress in traditional robes for the <ref target="/wiki/Tea_ceremony" title="Tea ceremony">tea ceremony</ref>, Kayama gradually adopts the manners, culture and dress of the newcomers, proudly displaying a new pocket watch, cutaway coat and "A Bowler Hat". Although Kayama, as stated in his reports to the Shogun, manages to reach an "understanding" with the Western merchants and diplomats, there are other less pleasant changes prompted by westernization. Three British Sailors mistake the daughter of a samurai for a <ref target="/wiki/Geisha" title="Geisha">geisha</ref> ("Pretty Lady"). Though their approach is initially gentle, they grow more persistent to the point where they offer her money (with insinuations of intended rape); the girl cries for help and her father kills one of the confused Tars. Kayama and Abe travel to the Emperor's court discussing the situation. While on the road, their party is attacked by cloaked assassins sent by the Lords of the South and Abe is assassinated. Kayama is horrified to discover that one of the assassins is his former friend, Manjiro; they fight and Kayama is killed.</p>
<p>In the ensuing turmoil, the puppet Emperor seizes real power and vows that Japan will modernize itself. As the country moves from one innovation to the "Next!", the Imperial robes are removed layer by layer to show the Reciter in modern dress. Contemporary Japan - the country of Toyota, Seiko, air and water pollution and market domination - assembles itself around him and its accomplishments are extolled. "Nippon. The Floating Kingdom. There was a time when foreigners were not welcome here. But that was long ago..." he says, "Welcome to Japan."</p>

<h2>Critical response and analysis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Overtures&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: Critical response and analysis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>"Someone in a Tree", where two witnesses describe negotiations between the Japanese and Americans, is Sondheim's favorite song out of everything he has written.<ref target="#cite_note-17">[17]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-18">[18]</ref> "A Bowler Hat" presents the show's theme, as a samurai gradually becomes more Westernized as he progressively adopts the habits and affectations of the foreigners he is meant to supervise.<ref target="#cite_note-19">[19]</ref> “Pretty Lady” is a contrapuntal trio of three British sailors who have mistaken a young girl for a geisha and are attempting to woo her. This is, perhaps, the musical fusion highlight of the show as the orchestra and lays descending parallel 4ths and the singers use a counterpoint form established during the Western Renaissance; again the chord progression is often IV to I, again eschewing Pentatonics. </p>
<ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref> review of the original 1976 production said "The lyrics are totally Western and—as is the custom with Mr. Sondheim—devilish, wittily and delightfully clever. Mr. Sondheim is the most remarkable man in the Broadway musical today—and here he shows it victoriously...Mr. Prince's staging uses all the familiar Kabuki tricks—often with voices screeching in the air like lonely sea birds—and stylizations with screens and things, and stagehands all masked in black to make them invisible to the audience. Like choreography, the direction is designed to meld Kabuki with Western forms...the attempt is so bold and the achievement so fascinating, that its obvious faults demand to be overlooked. It tries to soar—sometimes it only floats, sometimes it actually sinks—but it tries to soar. And the music and lyrics are as pretty and as well-formed as a bonsai tree. "Pacific Overtures" is very, very different."<ref target="#cite_note-20">[20]</ref>
<ref target="/wiki/Walter_Kerr" title="Walter Kerr">Walter Kerr</ref>'s article in The New York Times on the original 1976 production said "But no amount of performing, or of incidental charm, can salvage "Pacific Overtures." The occasion is essentially dull and immobile because we are never properly placed in it, drawn neither East nor West, given no specific emotional or cultural bearings."<ref target="#cite_note-21">[21]</ref> Ruth Mitchell, assistant to Mr. Prince, said in an interview with WPIX that a sense of not belonging was intentional as that was the very point of the show. 
<ref target="/wiki/Frank_Rich" title="Frank Rich">Frank Rich</ref>, reviewing the 1984 revival for The New York Times stated that "the show attempts an ironic marriage of Broadway and Oriental idioms in its staging, its storytelling techniques and, most of all, in its haunting Stephen Sondheim songs. It's a shotgun marriage, to be sure - with results that are variously sophisticated and simplistic, beautiful and vulgar. But if Pacific Overtures is never going to be anyone's favorite Sondheim musical, it is a far more forceful and enjoyable evening at the Promenade than it was eight years ago at the Winter Garden...Many of the songs are brilliant, self-contained playlets. In Four Black Dragons various peasants describe the arrival of the American ships with escalating panic, until finally the nightmarish event does seem to be, as claimed, the end of the world....Someone in a Tree, is a compact <ref target="/wiki/Rashomon" title="Rashomon">Rashomon</ref> - and as fine as anything Mr. Sondheim has written...The single Act II triumph, Bowler Hat, could well be a <ref target="/wiki/V._S._Naipaul" title="V. S. Naipaul">V. S. Naipaul</ref> tale set to music and illustrated with spare Japanese brushstrokes...Bowler Hat delivers the point of Pacific Overtures so artfully that the rest of Act II seems superfluous."<ref target="#cite_note-22">[22]</ref>
<p>The 2004 production was not as well received. It was based on a critically praised Japanese language production by director Amon Miyamoto. <ref target="/wiki/Ben_Brantley" title="Ben Brantley">Ben Brantley</ref>, reviewing for The New York Times wrote: "Now Mr. Miyamoto and "Pacific Overtures" have returned with an English-speaking, predominantly Asian-American cast, which makes distracting supertitles unnecessary. The show's sets, costumes and governing concept remain more or less the same. Yet unlike the New National Theater of Tokyo production, which was remarkable for its conviction and cohesiveness, this latest incarnation from the Roundabout Theater Company has the bleary, disoriented quality of someone suffering from jet lag after a sleepless trans-Pacific flight. Something has definitely been lost in the retranslation." Of the cast, Brantley wrote, "Even as they sing sweetly and smile engagingly, they appear to be asking themselves, "What am I doing here?""<ref target="#cite_note-23">[23]</ref></p>
