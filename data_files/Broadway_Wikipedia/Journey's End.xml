<p>Journey's End is a 1928 dramatic play, the seventh of English playwright <ref target="/wiki/R._C._Sherriff" title="R. C. Sherriff">R. C. Sherriff</ref>. It was first performed at the <ref target="/wiki/Apollo_Theatre" title="Apollo Theatre">Apollo Theatre</ref> in London by the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Incorporated_Stage_Society" title="Incorporated Stage Society">Incorporated Stage Society</ref> on 9 December 1928, starring a young <ref target="/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</ref>, and soon moved to other West End theatres for a two-year run. It was included in <ref target="/wiki/Burns_Mantle" title="Burns Mantle">Burns Mantle</ref>'s The Best Plays of 1928–1929. The piece quickly became internationally popular, with numerous productions and tours in English and other languages. A 1930 <ref target="/wiki/Journey%27s_End_(1930_film)" title="Journey's End (1930 film)">film version</ref> was followed by other adaptations, and the play set a high standard for other works dealing with similar themes, and influenced playwrights including <ref target="/wiki/No%C3%ABl_Coward" title="Noël Coward">Noël Coward</ref>.</p>

<h2>Plot summary[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Journey%27s_End&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Plot summary">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Act I[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Journey%27s_End&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Act I">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>In the British trenches before <ref target="/wiki/Saint-Quentin,_Aisne" title="Saint-Quentin, Aisne">Saint-Quentin</ref>, Captain Hardy converses with Lieutenant Osborne, an older man and <ref target="/wiki/Public_school_(United_Kingdom)" title="Public school (United Kingdom)">public school</ref> master, who has come to relieve him. Hardy jokes about the behaviour of Captain Stanhope, who has turned to alcohol to cope with the stress which the war has caused him. While Hardy jokes, Osborne defends Stanhope and describes him as "the best company commander we've got".</p>
<p>Private Mason, a servant cook, often forgets about ingredients and key parts of the food that he prepares for the officers. </p>
<p>Second Lieutenant Trotter is a rotund officer commissioned from the ranks who likes his food; he can't stand the war and counts down each hour that he serves in the front line by drawing circles onto a piece of paper and then colouring them in. </p>
<p>Second Lieutenant James "Jimmy" Raleigh is a young and naive officer who joins the company. Raleigh knew Stanhope from school, where Stanhope was skipper at rugby; Raleigh refers to Stanhope as Dennis. </p>
<p>Raleigh admits that he requested to be sent to Stanhope's company. Osborne hints to Raleigh that Stanhope will not be the same person he knew from school, as the experiences of war have changed him; however, Raleigh does not seem to understand. </p>
<p>Stanhope is angry that Raleigh has been allowed to join him and describes the boy as a hero-worshipper. As Stanhope is in a relationship with Raleigh's sister Madge, he is concerned that Raleigh will write home and inform his sister of Stanhope's drinking. Stanhope tells Osborne that he will censor Raleigh's letters so this will not happen; Osborne does not approve.</p>
<p>Stanhope has a keen sense of duty and feels that he must continue to serve rather than take leave to which he is entitled. He criticises another soldier, Second Lieutenant Hibbert, who he thinks is faking <ref target="/wiki/Neuralgia" title="Neuralgia">neuralgia</ref> in the eye so that he can be sent home instead of continuing fighting. </p>
<p>Osborne puts a tired and somewhat drunk Stanhope to bed. Stanhope (and the other officers) refer to Osborne as "Uncle".</p>

<h3>Act II[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Journey%27s_End&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Act II">edit</ref>]</h3>
<h4>Scene 1[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Journey%27s_End&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Scene 1">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>Trotter and Mason converse about the bacon rashers which the company has to eat. Trotter talks about how the start of spring makes him feel youthful; he also talks about the hollyhocks which he has planted. These conversations are a way of escaping the trenches and the reality of the war.</p>
<p>Osborne and Raleigh discuss how slowly time passes at the front, and the fact that both of them played rugby before the war and that Osborne was a schoolmaster before he signed up to fight. While Raleigh appears interested, Osborne points out that it is of little use now. </p>
<p>Osborne describes the madness of war when describing how German soldiers allowed the British to rescue a wounded soldier in No Man's Land, while the next day the two sides shelled each other heavily. He describes the war as "silly".</p>
<p>Stanhope announces that the barbed wire around the trenches needs to be mended. Information gathered from a captured German indicates that an enemy attack is planned to begin on Thursday morning, only two days away.</p>
<p>Stanhope confiscates a letter from Raleigh, insisting on his right to censor it. Stanhope is in a relationship with Raleigh's sister and is worried that, in the letter, Raleigh will reveal Stanhope's growing alcoholism. Full of self-loathing, Stanhope accedes to Osborne's offer to read the letter for him. The letter is, in fact, full of praise for Stanhope. The scene ends with Stanhope quietly demurring from Osborne's suggestion to re-seal the envelope.</p>

<h4>Scene 2[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Journey%27s_End&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Scene 2">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>In a meeting with the Sergeant Major it is announced that the attack is taking place on Thursday. Stanhope and the Sergeant-Major discuss battle plans. The Colonel relays orders that the General wants a raid to take place on the German trench prior to the attack, "a surprise daylight raid", all previous raids having been made under cover of darkness, and that they want to be informed of the outcome by 7 p.m. Stanhope states that such a plan is absurd, and that the General and his staff merely want this so their dinner will not be delayed.</p>
<p>The Colonel agrees with Stanhope but says that orders are orders, and they must be obeyed. Later, it is stated that in a similar raid, after the British artillery bombardment, the Germans had tied red rag to the gaps in the barbed wire so that their soldiers knew exactly where to train their machine guns. </p>
<p>It is decided that Osborne and Raleigh will be the officers to go on the raid, despite the fact that Raleigh has only recently entered the war.</p>
<p>Hibbert complains to Stanhope about the neuralgia he states he has been suffering from. Stanhope replies: "it would be better to die from the pain, than from being shot for desertion". Hibbert maintains that he does have neuralgia and the right to leave the battlefield to seek treatment, but when Stanhope threatens to shoot him if he goes, Hibbert breaks down crying. The two soldiers admit to each other that they feel exactly the same way, and are struggling to cope with the stresses that the war is putting on them.</p>
<p>Osborne reads aloud to Trotter from <ref target="/wiki/Lewis_Carroll" title="Lewis Carroll">Lewis Carroll</ref>'s <ref target="/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland" title="Alice's Adventures in Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</ref>; another attempt to escape from the realities of the war. The scene ends with the idealistic Raleigh, who is untouched by the war, stating that it is "frightfully exciting" that he has been picked for the raid.</p>

<h3>Act III[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Journey%27s_End&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Act III">edit</ref>]</h3>
<h4>Scene 1[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Journey%27s_End&action=edit&section=7" title="Edit section: Scene 1">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>There is confirmation that the raid is still going ahead. The Colonel states that a German soldier needs to be captured so that intelligence can be extracted from him. Osborne admits to Stanhope that he knows he's probably not coming back, and asks Stanhope to look after his most cherished possessions and send them to his wife if he does not return after the raid. In the minutes before going over the top, Raleigh and Osborne talk about home – the <ref target="/wiki/New_Forest" title="New Forest">New Forest</ref> and the town of <ref target="/wiki/Lyndhurst,_Hampshire" title="Lyndhurst, Hampshire">Lyndhurst</ref> – to pass the time. Smoke-bombs are fired, the soldiers move towards the German trench, and a young German soldier is captured. However, Stanhope finds out that Osborne has been killed although Raleigh has survived. </p>
<p>Stanhope sarcastically states, "How awfully nice – if the Brigadier's pleased", when the Colonel's first concern is whether information has been gathered, not whether all the soldiers have returned safely. Six of ten <ref target="/wiki/Other_ranks_(UK)" title="Other ranks (UK)">other ranks</ref> have been killed.</p>

<h4>Scene 2[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Journey%27s_End&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: Scene 2">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>Trotter, Stanhope, and Hibbert drink and talk about women. They all appear to be enjoying themselves until Hibbert is annoyed when Stanhope tells him to go to bed, and he tells Stanhope to go to bed instead, then Stanhope suddenly becomes angry and begins to shout at Hibbert, and tells him to clear off and get out.</p>
<p>Stanhope also becomes angry at Raleigh, who did not eat with the officers that night but preferred to eat with his men. Stanhope is offended by this, and Raleigh eventually admits that he feels he cannot eat while he thinks that Osborne is dead, and his body is in No Man's Land. Stanhope is angry because Raleigh had seemed to imply that Stanhope didn't care about Osborne's death because Stanhope was eating and drinking. Stanhope yells at Raleigh that he drinks to cope with the fact that Osborne died, to forget. Stanhope asks to be left alone and angrily tells Raleigh to leave.</p>

<h4>Scene 3[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Journey%27s_End&action=edit&section=9" title="Edit section: Scene 3">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>The German attack on the British trenches approaches, and the Sergeant Major tells Stanhope they should expect heavy losses. When it arrives, Hibbert is reluctant to get out of bed and into the trenches.</p>
<p>A message is relayed to Stanhope telling him that Raleigh has been injured by a shell and that his spine is damaged, meaning he can't move his legs. Stanhope orders that Raleigh be brought into his dugout. He comforts Raleigh while Raleigh lies in bed. Raleigh says that he is cold and that it is becoming dark; Stanhope moves the candle to the bed and goes deeper into the dugout to fetch a blanket, but, by the time he returns, Raleigh has died. </p>
<p>The shells continue to explode in the background. Stanhope receives a message that he is needed. He gets up to leave and, after he has exited, a mortar hits the dugout causing it to collapse and entomb Raleigh's corpse.</p>

<p>Sherriff had trouble getting Journey's End produced in the West End, writing that "Every management in London had turned the play down. They said people didn't want war plays [...] 'How can I put on a play with no leading lady?' one [theatre manager] had asked complainingly."<ref target="#cite_note-sheriff-1">[1]</ref> Sherriff used No Leading Lady as the title of his autobiography, published in 1968.</p>

<h2>Adaptations[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Journey%27s_End&action=edit&section=15" title="Edit section: Adaptations">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Film[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Journey%27s_End&action=edit&section=16" title="Edit section: Film">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>In 1930, James Whale directed <ref target="/wiki/Journey%27s_End_(1930_film)" title="Journey's End (1930 film)">an eponymous film based on the play</ref>, starring <ref target="/wiki/Colin_Clive" title="Colin Clive">Colin Clive</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/David_Manners" title="David Manners">David Manners</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Ian_Maclaren_(actor)" title="Ian Maclaren (actor)">Ian Maclaren</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-16">[16]</ref></p>
<p>A German remake, <ref target="/wiki/The_Other_Side_(1931_film)" title="The Other Side (1931 film)">The Other Side</ref> (Die andere Seite), was directed by <ref target="/wiki/Heinz_Paul" title="Heinz Paul">Heinz Paul</ref> in 1931.</p>
<p>The play is the basis for the film <ref target="/wiki/Aces_High_(film)" title="Aces High (film)">Aces High</ref> (1976), although the action was switched from the infantry to the <ref target="/wiki/Royal_Flying_Corps" title="Royal Flying Corps">Royal Flying Corps</ref>.</p>
<ref target="/wiki/Journey%27s_End_(2017_film)" title="Journey's End (2017 film)">A second eponymous English film adaptation</ref> was released in 2017, with a wider theatrical release in Spring 2018.

<h3>Television[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Journey%27s_End&action=edit&section=17" title="Edit section: Television">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The play was televised by the <ref target="/wiki/BBC_One" title="BBC One">BBC Television Service</ref>, live from its <ref target="/wiki/Alexandra_Palace" title="Alexandra Palace">Alexandra Palace</ref> studios, on 11 November 1937, in commemoration of <ref target="/wiki/Armistice_Day" title="Armistice Day">Armistice Day</ref>. Condensed into a one-hour version by the producer <ref target="/wiki/George_More_O%27Ferrall" title="George More O'Ferrall">George More O'Ferrall</ref>, some short sequences from the film <ref target="/wiki/Westfront_1918" title="Westfront 1918">Westfront 1918</ref> (1930) by <ref target="/wiki/G._W._Pabst" title="G. W. Pabst">G. W.

Neil More as the Colonel, R. Brooks Turner as the Company Sergeant-Major, Alexander Field as Mason, Reginald Smith as Hardy, and Olaf Olsen as the young German soldier. Because it was broadcast live, and the technology to record television programmes did not exist at the time, no visual records of the production survive other than still photographs.<ref target="#cite_note-17">[17]</ref></p>
<p>The play was adapted for television in 1988, starring <ref target="/wiki/Jeremy_Northam" title="Jeremy Northam">Jeremy Northam</ref> as Stanhope, <ref target="/wiki/Edward_Petherbridge" title="Edward Petherbridge">Edward Petherbridge</ref> as Osborne, and <ref target="/wiki/Timothy_Spall" title="Timothy Spall">Timothy Spall</ref> as Trotter.<ref target="#cite_note-18">[18]</ref> It held close to the original script although there were changes, the most obvious being the depiction on camera of the raid, which happens off-stage in the theatre production.</p>

<h2>Legacy[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Journey%27s_End&action=edit&section=18" title="Edit section: Legacy">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Other plays of the period dealing with the war tended to be judged by the standard of Journey's End.<ref target="#cite_note-19">[19]</ref> The play and its characters also influenced other writers. In 1930, <ref target="/wiki/No%C3%ABl_Coward" title="Noël Coward">Noël Coward</ref> briefly played the role of Stanhope while on tour in the Far East. He did not consider his performance successful, writing afterwards that his audience "politely watched me take a fine part in a fine play and throw it into the alley."<ref target="#cite_note-20">[20]</ref> However, he was "strongly affected by the poignancy of the play itself", and was inspired to write <ref target="/wiki/Post_Mortem_(Coward_play)" title="Post Mortem (Coward play)">Post Mortem</ref>, his own "angry little vilification of war", shortly afterwards.<ref target="#cite_note-lesley-21">[21]</ref></p>
<p>An alternate-timeline version of Raleigh appears in the 1995 novel <ref target="/wiki/The_Bloody_Red_Baron" title="The Bloody Red Baron">The Bloody Red Baron</ref> by <ref target="/wiki/Kim_Newman" title="Kim Newman">Kim Newman</ref>. The final series of the British comedy programme <ref target="/wiki/Blackadder" title="Blackadder">Blackadder</ref> (<ref target="/wiki/Blackadder_Goes_Forth" title="Blackadder Goes Forth">Blackadder Goes Forth</ref>) focuses on the same theme and setting, sometimes with heavy parallels. In <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Withnail_%26_I" title="Withnail & I">Withnail & I</ref> the out of work actor Marwood (played by <ref target="/wiki/Paul_McGann" title="Paul McGann">Paul McGann</ref>) is seen reading a copy of the play in the holiday cottage and goes on to win a role in a touring production by the close of the film.</p>
