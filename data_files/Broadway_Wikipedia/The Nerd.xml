<h2>Plot[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Nerd&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Plot">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Set in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Terre_Haute" title="Terre Haute">Terre Haute</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Indiana" title="Indiana">Indiana</ref> in late 1979, The Nerd presents the story of Willum Cubbert, an unassuming young architect, who is landlord to friends Tansy and Axel. Tansy is a smart, attractive woman, with a mutual (but unconsummated) attraction to Willum; she is determined to leave in order to pursue a career in television meteorology in Washington, D.C. Axel is a smart aleck drama critic who was once engaged, briefly, to Tansy. The three of them are good friends. Axel and Tansy are present when Willum, during a house party, becomes host to unexpected houseguest Rick Steadman, who had saved Willum's life in <ref target="/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam</ref>.</p>
<p>Over the years, Willum and Rick had exchanged occasional letters and greeting cards, though they never met. Willum has promised Rick that he could come to him for help at any time. While Willum is hosting a dinner party for his client (Warnock Waldgrave, for whom he is designing a hotel), Rick shows up. His awkward manner and inappropriate behavior throw the occasion into shambles. Rick decides to move in, and Willum feels that he can't say no, even when Rick begins to destroy his professional relationship with Mr. Waldgrave. Eventually at his wit's end, Willum decides to take a chance on Axel's plan to get rid of Rick.</p>
<p>What Willum and Tansy never learn is that "Rick Steadman" is not actually Rick Steadman, the brave man who risked his own life to save Willum. The intruder is actually an actor, Kemp Hall, who was persuaded by Axel to impersonate Rick Steadman in order to make Willum understand his real priorities. Kemp, playing the nerd, drives Willum almost to (comical) violence as he becomes increasingly impossible to live with. Kemp has also, in the character of a man named Red Graham, been leaving phone messages for Willum, asking him to build a housing estate in <ref target="/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia" title="Alexandria, Virginia">Alexandria, Virginia</ref>; Axel points out to Willum that this is very close to Washington, D.C., and therefore very close to where Tansy is moving.</p>
<p>At the climax, Willum finally finds what Tansy calls the "gumption" to order Rick out of his home. He declares that he will leave for Alexandria the next day and "court Tansy till she cracks."<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> Tansy agrees that it is a good plan, and the two of them go out for some dinner. Axel is alone in the room and calls Kemp to say, "I think we did it, babe...I think a hundred percent." Kemp joins him: no longer the klutzy Rick, now an urbane, intelligent man. Kemp wonders what the real Rick Steadman is like, and Axel says, "Nice fella, probably." Kemp, who has made Willum's life hell for weeks, says, "Not a bad fellow, your friend Willum." Axel provides the theme of the play when he replies, "He's all right. He just needed to have his life interfered with a little, that's all."</p>

<h2>Productions[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Nerd&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Productions">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The play was first presented by the <ref target="/wiki/Milwaukee_Repertory_Theater" title="Milwaukee Repertory Theater">Milwaukee Repertory Theater</ref> in April 1981; author Shue played the role of Willum Cubbert.</p>
<p>The play had its European premiere in 1982. It was directed by <ref target="/wiki/Braham_Murray" title="Braham Murray">Braham Murray</ref> at the <ref target="/wiki/Royal_Exchange,_Manchester" title="Royal Exchange, Manchester">Royal Exchange, Manchester</ref> and starred <ref target="/wiki/Derek_Griffiths" title="Derek Griffiths">Derek Griffiths</ref> as Rick and <ref target="/wiki/David_Horovitch" title="David Horovitch">David Horovitch</ref> as Willum.</p>
<p>The play ran on Broadway for 441 performances (March 22, 1987 – April 10, 1988), starring <ref target="/wiki/Mark_Hamill" title="Mark Hamill">Mark Hamill</ref> and directed by <ref target="/wiki/Charles_Nelson_Reilly" title="Charles Nelson Reilly">Charles Nelson Reilly</ref>.</p>
<p>In the 1987 production, the action diverged from the play in places, such as Robert Joy (as Rick) squawking like a chicken when the guests at Willum's party begin to eat <ref target="/wiki/Deviled_egg" title="Deviled egg">deviled eggs</ref> and, later, spraying Redi-Whip into his mouth.<ref target="#cite_note-Rich-4">[4]</ref></p>

<h2>Characters[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Nerd&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Willum Cubbert: Willum is an architect, currently designing a hotel for Mr. Waldgrave, and a pushover. He's kind and intelligent, but Tansy says he "could use a little gumption." He lacks the backbone to stand up for himself. Originally played by <ref target="/wiki/Mark_Hamill" title="Mark Hamill">Mark Hamill</ref> on Broadway, and later replaced by <ref target="/wiki/Gary_Burghoff" title="Gary Burghoff">Gary Burghoff</ref>. He rents two rooms in his house to Tansy and Axel.</p>
<p>Tansy McGinnis: A smart woman who is as attracted to Willum as he is to her, but who has been offered her dream job as a <ref target="/wiki/Weather_forecasting" title="Weather forecasting">television weather forecaster</ref> in Washington, D.C., and feels guilty for leaving Willum behind. Idealistic, perky, and just as kind as Willum. The role was created by Patricia Kalember on Broadway.</p>
<p>Axel Hammond: Willum's best friend. He's a pretentious, often-inebriated drama critic, always ready with a sarcastic comment. Originally played by <ref target="/wiki/Peter_Riegert" title="Peter Riegert">Peter Riegert</ref> on Broadway.</p>
<p>Rick Steadman/Kemp Hall: The titular "nerd." He's oblivious to insult and lacks manners or sensitivity. He tells Willum that he works as an inspector at a chalk factory in Wisconsin. Originally played by <ref target="/wiki/Robert_Joy" title="Robert Joy">Robert Joy</ref> on Broadway.</p>
<p>Warnock Waldgrave: A boisterous, slightly dim businessman, owner of eight hotels, with no creativity and no tact. He never smiles. Originally played by <ref target="/wiki/Wayne_Tippit" title="Wayne Tippit">Wayne Tippit</ref> on Broadway.</p>
<p>Clelia Waldgrave: Mr. Waldgrave's high-strung, put-upon wife. She holds back all of her emotions, and only releases her stress when she can break "something small." Originally played by <ref target="/wiki/Pamela_Blair" title="Pamela Blair">Pamela Blair</ref> on Broadway.</p>
<p>Thor Waldgrave: The Waldgraves' terror of a son. "Poster child for <ref target="/wiki/Planned_Parenthood" title="Planned Parenthood">Planned Parenthood</ref>," as Axel calls him. Spends most of the play hiding in a closet or bedroom. Originally played by Timothy Geissler on Broadway.</p>
<h2>Themes[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Nerd&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Themes">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>This comedy play has some serious themes running throughout.</p>

<h3>Selflessness[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Nerd&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Selflessness">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>When Willum has a surprise birthday party from Axel and Tansy, he tells Tansy and Axel that he owes his life to Rick Steadman, who was himself badly injured when he found Willum injured in Vietnam, and Rick pulled Willum to safety. He even made sure that Willum received medical attention before he himself did. Willum has never met the man, but has corresponded with him over the years out of gratitude. Willum always promised that if Rick needed help of any kind, Willum would be there for him.</p>

<h3>Selfishness[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Nerd&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Selfishness">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Tansy challenges Axel that, because she perceives him as being self-absorbed all the time, she would like to see him do <ref target="/wiki/Pay_it_forward" title="Pay it forward">an anonymous favor</ref> for someone, just one time: "I'd feel easier about leaving here if I could see you once just go crazy and do something for somebody." Axel replies jokingly (the stage directions say "As <ref target="/wiki/Bill_Sikes" title="Bill Sikes">Bill Sykes</ref>"): "Not this bloke. A villain I be, and a villain I'll stay." However, unbeknownst to Tansy and Willum, Axel has already set in motion the sort of demonstration of love that Tansy had a vague idea of: Axel has persuaded Kemp Hall to act as Rick Steadman and to behave unbearably, to force Willum to discover the "gumption" that he must find in himself. In many ways, this play resembles the short story "<ref target='/wiki/Saki#"The_Unrest-Cure"' title="Saki">The Unrest-Cure</ref>" by <ref target="/wiki/Saki" title="Saki">Saki</ref>, in which a young man interferes with a household in order to make the denizens appreciate what they have.</p>

<h2>Critical reception[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Nerd&action=edit&section=7" title="Edit section: Critical reception">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Author <ref target="/wiki/Thomas_M._Disch" title="Thomas M. Disch">Thomas M. Disch</ref> gave a mixed review of a 1987 performance, saying that the play "has whole half-hours that border on the moronic," yet it "racks up more laughs, and louder, than any farce this side of Alan Ayckbourn. Noises Off is an academic exercise by comparison, and The House of Blue Leaves demure." Disch concluded, "At some point disbelief ceases to be suspended, but even then it's possible to enjoy the ride."<ref target="#cite_note-6">[6]</ref></p>
<ref target="/wiki/Frank_Rich" title="Frank Rich">Frank Rich</ref>, who also saw the play with Mark Hamill and Robert Joy, thought that while "Mr. Shue provides some bright one-liners," the play reminded him of "the cartoon world of Lucille Ball and Gale Gordon."<ref target="#cite_note-Rich-4">[4]</ref>
