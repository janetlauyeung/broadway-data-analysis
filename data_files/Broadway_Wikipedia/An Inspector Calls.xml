<head>Synopsis</head>
<p>At the Birlings' home in the industrial town of Brumley, Arthur Birling – a wealthy factory owner and local politician – celebrates his daughter Sheila's engagement to a rival magnate's son, Gerald Croft. Also in attendance are Arthur's wife Sybil and their son Eric (whose drinking problem the family discreetly ignores). Following dinner, Arthur lectures them on the importance of self-reliance and looking after one's own, and talks of the bright future that awaits them (which, he hopes, will include a place for himself on the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Honours_list" title="Honours list">honours list</ref>).</p>
<p>The evening is interrupted by a man calling himself Inspector Goole, who is investigating the suicide of Eva Smith. Her diary, the Inspector explains, named members of the Birling family. Goole produces a photograph of Eva and shows it to Arthur, who acknowledges that she worked in one of his mills. He admits that he dismissed her from Birling and Company some months ago for her involvement in an abortive workers' strike, but denies responsibility for her death.</p>
<p>After prompting from Goole, Sheila admits to recognising Eva too. She had contrived to have her fired from her department store job over an imagined slight. Her real motivation, Sheila confesses, was the jealousy and spite she felt towards the younger, prettier woman.</p>
<p>At the mention of Eva's alias "Daisy Renton", Gerald starts. He admits to having met a woman by that name in the Palace Bar, whom he gave money and arranged to see again. Goole reveals that Gerald had installed Eva as his mistress, becoming "the most important person in her life", before abruptly cutting her off. Arthur and Sybil are horrified, and Sheila returns her engagement ring.</p>
<p>Goole next turns his sight on Sybil, whom he identifies as the head of a women's charity to which Eva, pregnant and destitute, had turned for help. Sybil, however, convinced the committee to deny her application for financial aid. Despite vigorous cross-examination from Goole, Sybil denies any wrongdoing. Goole then plays his final card, making Sybil lay the blame at the feet of the "drunken young man" who got Eva pregnant. Eric then enters, and after brief questioning from Goole, breaks down and admits to being responsible for the pregnancy, having forced himself on Eva after a drinking spree at the Palace Bar. He had taken funds from his father's business in order to support her and the child, but she refused the stolen money. Arthur and Sybil are outraged by Eric's actions, and the evening dissolves into angry recriminations.</p>
<p>Goole's questioning reveals that each member of the family had contributed to Eva's despondency and suicide. He reminds the Birlings that actions have consequences and that all people are intertwined in one society. As Goole leaves he warns that "If men will not learn that lesson, then they will be taught it in fire and blood and anguish" – an allusion to <ref target="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">the impending war</ref>.</p>
<p>Gerald returns, telling the family that there may be no "Inspector Goole" on the police force. Arthur makes a call to the chief constable, who confirms this. Learning from a second call to the infirmary that no recent cases of suicide have been reported, the family surmise that the Inspector was a fraud and his story fictitious. Gerald and the elder Birlings celebrate, but the younger Birlings still realise the error of their ways, and promise to change.</p>
<p>The play ends with a telephone call, taken by Arthur, who reports that a young woman has died (a suspected case of suicide), and that the police are on their way to question them. Goole's true identity is left unexplained, but it is clear that the family's confessions over the course of the evening have all been true, and that public disgrace will soon befall them.</p>

<head>Characters</head>
<head>Inspector Goole</head>
<p>The mysterious "Inspector Goole" claims to have seen Eva Smith's dead body earlier that day, and to have been given "a duty" to investigate her death and the Birlings' involvement in it. He seems to be familiar with every detail of the case already, interrogating the family solely to reveal their guilt rather than to discover unknown information. Both during and after Goole's visit the Birlings question his credentials, and a phone call to the local police station reveals there is no one by his name on the force. Many critics and audiences have interpreted Goole's role as that of an "avenging angel" because of his supernatural omniscience and prophetic final warning, and even because of his name, which is a homophone for the word "<ref class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ghoul" title="wikt:ghoul">ghoul</ref>". It is suggested in the final scene that a quite real investigation will follow Goole's, and his purpose has been to warn the family in advance and encourage them to accept responsibility for their wrongdoing.</p>

<head>Eva Smith/Daisy Renton</head>
<p>Eva, or Daisy, is the unseen working-class woman who Goole claims took her own life in her mid twenties while pregnant with Eric Birling's baby, having been mistreated by each member of the family. She has no family of her own, it is explained, and must work for a living. Her beauty is commented on by all the characters, and attracts both Gerald and Eric's affection, as well as Sheila's jealousy. The female Birlings do not seem to believe Eva knows her place, and Sybil describes her as "impertinent" rather than meek and grateful as she should be towards her social superiors.</p>
<p>The audience is invited to dwell on Eva's suffering at the hands of a cruel and uncaring upper class, which has exploited, abused, and ravaged her, before washing its hands of her. At the end of the play, Gerald suggests that Eva Smith may not have been the same person but rather a <ref target="/wiki/Gestalt_psychology" title="Gestalt psychology">collective personification</ref> of all the different working-class women that the family had exploited, invented by Goole to make the family feel guilty. Yet the final phone call leaves open the possibility that Eva really did exist after all.</p>

<head>Arthur Birling</head>
<p>Arthur Birling is described as "a heavy-looking, rather <ref class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/portentous" title="wikt:portentous">portentous</ref> man in his middle fifties". He represents the capitalist ruling class, repeatedly describing himself with pride as a "hard-headed businessman", and is arguably the main subject of Priestley's social critique. Dominant, arrogant, self-centred, and morally blind, he is insistent throughout about his lack of responsibility for Eva's death; he fired her in order to quell dissent among his workforce and keep labour costs low, which he says is standard business practice. He remains unaffected by the details of the suicide, and his own concerns appear to be avoiding scandal, insisting that Eric account for the company money he stole, and convincing Sheila to reconsider her break with Gerald (so as to secure a promised Croft-Birling merger).</p>

<head>Sybil Birling</head>
<p>Sybil Birling, "a rather cold woman" of about fifty, is Arthur's wife. As the leader of a charitable organisation, she assumes a social and moral superiority over Inspector Goole, whose questioning style she frequently refers to as "impertinent" and "offensive". Like her husband, she refuses to accept responsibility for the death of Eva Smith, and seems more concerned with maintaining the family's reputation, even going so far as to lie and deny that she recognizes the girl's picture. She derides women like Eva as immoral, dishonest, and greedy.</p>

<head>Sheila Birling</head>
<p>Sheila begins as a naive and self-centred young woman, but becomes the most sympathetic member of the Birling family over the course of the play, showing remorse for her part in Eva's downfall and encouraging her family to do the same. By the play's end her social conscience has been awakened and she has a new awareness of her responsibilities to others. She represents the younger generation's break from the selfish behaviour of its forebears.</p>

<head>Eric Birling</head>
<p>Eric is presented as a "Jack-the-Lad" character with a drinking habit, which led to him getting Eva pregnant. He is distanced from the rest of the family and feels he cannot talk to them about his problems. With his sister, he repents of and accepts responsibility for the way he treated Eva.</p>

<head>Gerald Croft</head>
<p>The son of Sir George and Lady Croft of Crofts Limited, a competitor of Birling and Company, he is at the Birling residence to celebrate his recent engagement to Sheila. Gerald's revealed affair with Eva puts an end to the relationship, though Sheila commends him for his truthfulness and for his initial compassion towards the girl. Gerald believes that Goole is not a police inspector, that the family may not all be referring to the same woman, and that there may not be a body. Initially he appears to be correct, and does not think the Birlings have anything to feel ashamed of or worry about. He seems excited at the prospect of unmasking the "false" Inspector and seems almost desperate for others to believe him.</p>

<head>Criticism and interpretation</head>
<p>Highly successful after its first and subsequent London productions, the play is now considered one of Priestley's greatest works, and has been subject to a variety of critical interpretations.</p>
<p>After the new wave of social realist theatre in the 1950s and 1960s, the play fell out of fashion, and was dismissed as an example of outdated <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bourgeois" title="Bourgeois">bourgeois</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Drawing_room_play" title="Drawing room play">"drawing room" dramas</ref>, and became a staple of regional repertory theatre. Following several successful revivals (including <ref target="/wiki/Stephen_Daldry" title="Stephen Daldry">Stephen Daldry</ref>'s 1992 production for the <ref target="/wiki/Royal_National_Theatre" title="Royal National Theatre">National Theatre</ref>), the play was "rediscovered" and hailed as a damning social criticism of capitalism and middle-class hypocrisy in the manner of the social realist dramas of Shaw and Ibsen. It has been read as a parable about the destruction of Victorian social values and the disintegration of pre-World War I English society, and Goole's final speech has been interpreted variously as a quasi-Christian vision of hell and judgement, and as a socialist manifesto.</p>
<p>The struggle between the embattled patriarch Arthur Birling and Inspector Goole has been interpreted by many critics as a symbolic confrontation between capitalism and socialism, and arguably demonstrates Priestley's socialist political criticism of the perceived-selfishness and moral hypocrisy of middle-class capitalist society. While no single member of the Birling family is solely responsible for Eva's death, together they function as a hermetic class system that exploits neglected, vulnerable women, with each example of exploitation leading collectively to Eva's social exclusion, despair and suicide. The play also arguably acts as a critique of Victorian-era notions of middle-class philanthropy towards the poor, which is based on presumptions of the charity-givers' social superiority and severe moral judgement towards the "deserving poor". The romantic idea of gentlemanly chivalry towards "fallen women" is also debunked as being based on male lust and sexual exploitation of the weak by the powerful. In Goole's final speech, Eva Smith is referred to as a representative for millions of other vulnerable working-class people, and can be read as a call to action for English society to take more responsibility for working-class people, prefiguring the development of the post-World War II <ref target="/wiki/Welfare_state" title="Welfare state">welfare state</ref>.</p>

<p>A revival of the play by British director <ref target="/wiki/Stephen_Daldry" title="Stephen Daldry">Stephen Daldry</ref> opened at the <ref target="/wiki/Royal_National_Theatre" title="Royal National Theatre">National Theatre</ref>'s <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lyttelton_Theatre" title="Lyttelton Theatre">Lyttelton Theatre</ref> in September 1992. Daldry's concept was to reference two eras: the 1945 post-war era, when the play was written, and the ostensible historical setting for the work in pre-war 1912; this emphasised the way the character Goole was observing, and deploring, the Birling family's behaviour from Priestley's own cultural viewpoint.<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-lyn-10">[10]</ref> It won the <ref target="/wiki/Drama_Desk_Award_for_Outstanding_Revival" title="Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival">Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Play</ref>, and was widely praised for making the work involving and politically relevant for a modern audience. The production is often credited with single-handedly rediscovering Priestley's works and "rescuing" him from the reputation of being obsolete and class-bound, although the production had some detractors, including <ref target="/wiki/Sheridan_Morley" title="Sheridan Morley">Sheridan Morley</ref><ref target="#cite_note-11">[11]</ref> who regarded it as a gimmicky travesty of the author's patent intentions. The success of the production since 1992 has led to a critical reappraisal of Priestley as a politically engaged playwright who offered a sustained critique of the hypocrisy of English society. A Broadway transfer of the production starring <ref target="/wiki/Philip_Bosco" title="Philip Bosco">Philip Bosco</ref> opened at the Royale Theatre (now the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bernard_Jacobs_Theatre" title="Bernard Jacobs Theatre">Bernard Jacobs Theatre</ref>) on 27 April 1994 and played 454 performances.<ref target="#cite_note-12">[12]</ref> Another production opened on 25 October 1995 at the Garrick Theatre and ran for six years until its transfer to the Playhouse Theatre in 2001. In 2009 it reopened at the Novello Theatre for a year-long run, followed by another transfer to Wyndham's Theatre in December 2009, running for only four months.</p>

<p>Produced by PW Productions, Stephen Daldry's revival of An Inspector Calls first opened at the National Theatre in 1992 and it was a ground-breaking success which has since become the longest running revival of the play, seen by around 3 million theatregoers. It has since returned to the west end in 2016 where it was revived again at the national theatre where the play first began. Daldry's concept was to reference two eras: the 1945 post-war era, when the play was written, and the ostensible historical setting for the work in pre-war 1912; this emphasised the way the character Goole was observing, and deploring, the Birling family's behaviour from Priestley's own cultural viewpoint.</p>
<p>In the original revival in 1992 the set consisted of an Edwardian House on stilts, A painted sky cyclorama, which stretches out across the stage, and a double raked cobbled floor. However, the most evocative element of the set was the rain. It was said to have been “so successful that for a couple of years after the initial production we received calls from designers and production managers from around the world asking how we did it.”</p>
<p>The set and physical production elements are more or less unchanged, proving that they have truly stood the test of time.</p>
