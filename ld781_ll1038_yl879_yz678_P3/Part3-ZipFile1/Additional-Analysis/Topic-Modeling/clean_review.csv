Cats,9,First Nighter: You Better Believe That the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Trevor Nunn-T. S. Eliot “Cats” is Now and Forever,"It's undoubtedly coincidence that Cats arrives on cats' feet just after the national political conventions have concluded. Patrons seeing it this week and in the weeks to come may find themselves reminded of those congregations. Truth to tell, they're more likely to see the Democrat Convention echoed rather than the Republican Convention. The diversity of the former outshines the divisiveness of the latter-the many unison dance routines being a visual metaphor for cohesion and promise. And it may be that when Grizabella, a woman, is selected to rise to new heights, more than a few spectators will flash on the Democrat's 2016 nominee ascending to her next vaunted level.",Huffington Post,David Finkle,07/31/2016
Cats,9,Theater Review: 'Cats',"It's kitschy and fun, sometimes quite touching, and marvelously well done. It'll likely be very nostalgic for anyone who saw the show before, and, I'm guessing, a treat for people who haven't, and don't go expecting a profound theatrical experience. ""Cats"" is a one-of-a-kind entertainment, and I can't imagine a young, budding theater-lover, in particular, not being entranced.",NorthJersey.com,Robert Feldberg,07/31/2016
Cats,8,"Review: Does ‘Cats’ Have Nine Lives on Broadway? Two, Certainly","The overriding spirit of the revival appears to be the familiar motto: Don't mess with success. Once again, the production is directed by Trevor Nunn, with sets and costumes by John Napier. Once again, a Broadway theater has been transformed into a grungy London junkyard, where trash piles up against the walls and spills out into the auditorium - albeit on a somewhat smaller scale. That levitating tire, as famous a set piece as a certain falling chandelier, presides once again at the back of the stage. (Apparently the license plate on the battered car, which reads ""NAP 70,"" is an in-joke indicating how many productions Mr. Napier has designed. Imagine how many leg warmers have been involved.)",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,07/31/2016
Cats,8,‘Cats': now and forever. Again.,"And whatever other misgivings you might have, wading through the thin story of the ascension of Grizabella the Glamour Cat (British vocalist Leona Lewis) to the redemptive Heaviside Layer, the cast assembled for the revival is gangbusters. Andy Blankenbuehler, the Tony-winning choreographer of ""Hamilton,"" has been recruited to tweak the dances of ""Cats's"" original choreographer, Gillian Lynne (another Tony winner). His refinements inject precision and verve and allow several of the performers, in their equitably distributed spotlight moments, to show off grandly. Among the most exciting are Ricky Ubeda as the magician cat, Mistoffelees; Tyler Hanes, playing Rum Tug Tugger, the rock-and-roll cat, and Jess LeProtto and Shonica Gooden as the mischief makers Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer.",Washington Post,Peter Marks,07/31/2016
Cats,8,‘Cats’ Broadway revival: Classic musical is back but not better,"The revival could be better in some respects. The original production provided a more transporting experience because it played on a wider stage, which increased the intimacy, and its theater was more extensively transformed to suit the show's unique physical environment. Musically, the size of the orchestra has been cut in half.",amNY,Matt Windman,07/31/2016

Cats,7,Review: Andrew Lloyd Webber’s ‘Cats’ Returns to Broadway,"Memories could be fatal to this revival of ""Cats"" - specifically, the memory of Betty Buckley as Grizabella, singing ""Memory"" as it's meant to be sung, with heartbreaking beauty and exquisite pain by a great stage performer. Leona Lewis, the British pop star anointed by Andrew Lloyd Webber himself, isn't in her league. Happily, nothing as catty can be said of the rest of this fabulous revival of the 1981 musical phenom that padded its way around the world on little cats' feet.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,07/31/2016
Cats,7,"Theater Review: The Persistence of “Memory,” and the Return of Cats","To be fair, Cats is not quite as bad as cultural elites liked to suggest; there were far worse shows during its 18-year run. But Cats was both pretentious and déclassé, dragging the musical form down from its recent supposed glory just as it dragged Eliot down from Prufrock to Pouncival. This was, after all, the megahit that opened the door for the invasion of European pop operas that all but smothered the native product for two decades. Seeing it 34 years later, in a Broadway environment that has recently produced the likes of Hamilton and Fun Home, is to experience something milder and less dangerous than it once seemed. It's not so much feline as bovine, as if Nunn and Lloyd Webber had spliced in some genetic material from another Eliot poem of the same period: ""Cows.""",Vulture,Jesse Green,07/31/2016
Cats,7,BWW Review: Charming CATS Revival Is Packed With Terrific Performances,"Pop star Leona Lewis has been cast as Grizabella, the cat of tragically faded glamour who sings the musical's dramatic 11 o'clocker, ""Memory.""

Cats,7,'Cats': Theater Review,"Although it remains to be seen whether this revival will live up to the original production's tagline of ""Now and Forever,"" enough time has passed for a new generation of theatergoers to embrace the show, while those who saw the original (and liked it) will probably want to return for a blast of nostalgia. And with the dramatic upturn in tourists to the Big Apple in recent years, there's no reason to think that this Cats won't be purring on Broadway for a very long time.",Hollywood Reporter,Frank Scheck,07/31/2016
Cats,7,‘Cats’ review: Beloved Broadway musical leaps back onstage,"Best of all is the refreshed choreography by Tony winner Andy Blankenbuehler (""Hamilton"") who has replaced Gillian Lynne's compilation of stock moves with variety and invention. Except for a preponderance of butt-waving, the taffy-jointed dancers have some of the angular, sudden, inexplicable moves of catliness. Highlights include balletic Georgina Pazcoguin, all in white, who moves as if she loves being in her skin, and Ricky Ubeda as Mr. Mistoffelees, who unspools turns and leaps with soft-paw landings.",Newsday,Linda Winer,07/31/2016
Cats,6,"Cats review – kitsch, dated … yet strangely adorable","Lewis has a beautiful voice, but when she performed Memory, she was not Grizabella the mangy old cat, but Leona Lewis, pop star and seller of 20m records, just as, a few years ago, when Catherine Zeta Jones played Desiree in A Little Night Music (also directed by Nunn) she busted out of role to sing Send in the Clowns with the zip of the Incredible Hulk busting out of his shirt. Perhaps this doesn't matter. A song sung on these terms can still be highly enjoyable, although in this case I found the performance of Memory rather stressful, particularly the crescendo at the end and the bits when Lewis listed dangerously to one side while doing some Acting. It was a relief when the story moved on.",Guardian,Emma Brockes,07/31/2016
Cats,6,Cats: EW stage review,"I have a bone to pick with Andrew Lloyd Webber about Cats. For the past few days, since I saw the first-ever Broadway revival at the Neil Simon Theatre, that's all I've had running through my head. And I'm not talking about ""Memory,"" the showstopper made famous by Barbra Streisand before Cats even opened on Broadway in 1982. I mean the almost hypnotically repetitive prologue ""Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats""; the jazzy, doo-wop ode to Jennyanydots, ""The Old Gumbie Cat""; and the singsongy ""Magical Mister Mistoffelees"" (""Oh! Well I never! Was there ever a cat so clever...""). Will anything - short of the ""It's a Small World"" theme song - banish these insistent melodies from my brain?",Entertainment Weekly,Melissa Rose Bernardo,07/31/2016
Cats,6,Cats: Leona Lewis brings glitz but no grit to her Broadway debut,"Directed by Trevor Nunn, and choreographed by the great Gillian Lynne, this Cats remains an evening of fluff and nonsense, really, with leg-warmers and cutesy costumes that should be risible to a cynic's eyes. Yet such is the innate confidence and innocent zest of this bizarre, feline spectacle that all cynicism just moults away.",Telegraph,Dominic Cavendish,07/31/2016
Cats,5,‘Cats’ Broadway Review: Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Hit Is Back for a 10th Life,...the production's hopes of updating one of Broadway's more maligned hits - and justifying its popularity - seems to have floated up to the Heaviside Layer that these cats so desperately crave. This revival provokes but one response to the show's onetime tagline: now and whatever.,The Wrap,Jason Clark,07/31/2016
Cats,5,"'Cats,' Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical starring Leona Lewis, didn't need another life on Broadway","The whisker of a plot and lyrics are drawn from T.S. Eliot's ""Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats."" A posse of pusses gather to see which one gets a shot at a new life. Who could it be? The Rum Tum Tugger (Tyler Hanes), who struts like a rock star? Twinkled-toed Jennyanydots (Eloise Kropp)? The frisky and nimble Skimbleshanks (Jeremy Davis)? The amazing often airborne Mistoffelees (Ricky Ubeda)? Or a dozen others? It's not much of a spoiler that it's shunned and bedraggled outcast Grizabella (Leona Lewis). After all, she gets ""Memory."" Too bad she inspires so little sympathy. The show's first tagline was ""now and forever."" More fitting for ""Cats"" 2.0 - now and whatever.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,07/31/2016
Cats,4,Broadway review: Cats at the Neil Simon Theater,"Today, Cats feels experimental only in the sense of writing a show as if Oklahoma! and Company never happened. Lloyd Webber's ability to craft a coherent book musical has always been shaky (School of Rock being a late-career exception to the rule). Cats is an attenuated high-concept revue that grows tedious by its second act. A bunch of cats slink out one night, introduce themselves and, by the end, two of them go to kitty heaven. Now and then you may catch a word not normally heard on Broadway: ""ineffable"" or ""perpendicular.""",TimeOut NY,David Cote,07/31/2016
The Mystery of Edwin Drood,9,Raising the Dickens in All of Us,"In an era when Broadway revivals of beloved musicals can seem dispiritingly skimpy, this handsome production offers a generous feast for the eyes, trimmed in holiday cheer for an added spritz of currency...And the evening’s performers — including a bona fide Broadway grande dame, Chita Rivera; a host of plush-voiced singers; and the jovial imp Jim Norton as the evening’s M.C. — throw themselves into the winking spirit of the show...Despite its varied charms, “The Mystery of Edwin Drood” remains a musical that ultimately adds up to less than the sum of its hard-working parts. The overelaborate finale — which includes not only the choosing of the murderer but also the selection of a detective and a happy couple to be paired off — somewhat taxes our delight in taking part…But then, who has not felt a bit deflated upon completing a page-turning detective story?...The musical “Edwin Drood” at least leaves behind moments of shimmering musical pleasure to savor, long after the miscreant of the night has been booed off the stage.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,11/13/2012

The Mystery of Edwin Drood,9,Finishing Dickens,"""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" ran for 608 performances. Now the Roundabout Theatre Company has brought ""Drood"" back to Broadway in a revival directed with rip-roaring éclat by Scott Ellis, and I'll be surprised if it doesn't run at least as long as the original 1985 production.

The Mystery of Edwin Drood,9,"Broadway review: It's no mystery, 'Drood' cast has an infectious good time","Director Scott Ellis' lively, crowd-pleasing and — given the horrors of the East Coast storms and the abiding comedic quality of the material — very well-timed Broadway revival...all has the feeling of a live version of a star-laden holiday TV special, with many of the same pluses and minuses…As a solve-it-yourself, self-aware musical, ""Drood"" presents some traps, not all of which are here fully avoided. At various points, one has to force oneself to re-engage with the grand questions of the plot, which are not always tracked as adroitly as would be ideal. The best productions of ""Drood"" manage, at least in the final number, to exploit the way the lyrics allow the clutter of the show to fall away — and to help us ponder a few broader matters of life and death, at least in passing. That never happens here. But that was bothering almost no one inside Studio 54. Block, who seems relieved not to carry the entire enterprise, sounds particularly spectacular, as does Betsy Wolfe as the ripe ingenue Rosa Bud. Rivera, as one might imagine, could not be a more delightful presence in any romp in town.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,11/13/2012
The Mystery of Edwin Drood,8,Review: Broadway revival of silly ‘The Mystery of Edwin Drood’ gets huge boost from veterans,"Perhaps the best part is watching the first-rate cast have so much fun — Stephanie J. Block shows real comedic power, Jim Norton is having a ball, Chita Rivera is giggly, Gregg Edelman is just silly and Will Chase is over-acting perfectly...This is a play where overacting can be done to perfection…The jokes are hoary, the songs are ditties (""Off to the Races"" is the best known) and the mystery not so mysterious — ""You might like to add that line to your list of suspicious statements!"" says one character to the audience — but the fun is infectious, even if it seems that the folks on stage might be having more of it than the paying guests…In the wrong hands, it can sit awkwardly in a Broadway house — too zany, too arch.

The Mystery of Edwin Drood,8,The Mystery of Edwin Drood,"The Roundabout's revival of ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" is a diverting and amiable entertainment. Rupert Holmes' unconventional musical -- derived from Dickens' 1870 serial novel, unfinished when he died without a hint as to how he intended to tie up the plot -- was an exuberant romp when Joe Papp's Public Theater first produced it in 1985. The elements, and the highlights, remain the same, even if the ebullience at Studio 54 seems more manufactured than irrepressible in spots.",Variety,Steve Suskin,11/13/2012
The Mystery of Edwin Drood,8,Theater Review: 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood',"""The Mystery of Edwin Drood,"" inspired by an unfinished Charles Dickens novel, is one of the most inventive, inspired and rousing musicals ever devised. And it is a pleasure to report that the Roundabout Theatre Company's revival is thoroughly well-cast and extremely enjoyable…As atmospherically staged by Scott Ellis, with sprightly choreography by Warren Carlyle and excellent music direction by Paul Gemignani, this production is a reminder that well-known musicals do not need to be reconstructed or darkened for their revivals. If the show is strong, have faith in it and all will fall into place.",amNY,Matt Windman,11/13/2012
The Mystery of Edwin Drood,8,Review: 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood',"The show does have some jaunty, quasi-operetta music with beautiful harmonic blends and a ravishing cast -- including Chita Rivera as Princess Puffer, madam of the opium den, and Jessie Mueller as the slinky-to-her-eyebrows Helena Landless, who, with her brother (Andy Karl) brings a bit of Colonial commentary as the exotics from Ceylon. Jim Norton maneuvers around the fast-patter songs with aplomb as the emcee; Stephanie J. Block is authoritative as Drood, the young gentleman who disappears. His beloved (Betsy Wolfe) is coveted by the opium fiend-music teacher (Will Chase)...Instead of trusting the characters and the mystery to build the suspense, however, Holmes aims for the campy, tiresome and childish. To vote, one presumably cares about who does what to whom. Considering Dickens' storytelling genius, the real mystery is why this isn't fun.",Newsday,Linda Winer,11/13/2012
The Mystery of Edwin Drood,8,Helped Choose Edwin Drood's Killer: My Review,"The original Drood was flawless, but this one--directed by Scott Ellis--does quite nicely, with splendid sets, good casting, and solid attention to the score, which is sophisticated and fun, only a couple of the songs making things temporarily turgid. In the cast, Gregg Edelman, Andy Karl, Jessie Mueller, Robert Creighton, and the gang are comically deft in their suspicous roles. Stephanie J. Block as Drood and Betsy Wolfe as his fiance Rosa Bud, handle the high-power singing. And as opium-wielding Princess Puffer, Chita Rivera lends her legendary presence and wit, making for a surprising Cockney matron and pulling it off with sass and class…It was magical. I vote yes.",Village Voice,Michael Musto,11/13/2012
The Mystery of Edwin Drood,7,The Mystery of Edwin Drood: Theater Review,"One of the refrains sung by the Victorian music hall performers in The Mystery of Edwin Drood is, “No good can come from bad.” The case isn’t quite so black and white in this 1985 “musicale with dramatic interludes” by Rupert Holmes, teased out of the unfinished Charles Dickens novel. But regardless of the accomplished cast and sparkling design and direction in Roundabout’s Broadway revival, nothing great can come of mediocre material…Holmes’ show scores points for ingenuity, but it often feels like being stuck for too long in front of an olde-worlde department-store window display. A vehicle running 2½ hours needs more memorable songs than these mostly interchangeable parlor ditties, and more engaging characters than this bunch, which by design, are cardboard cutouts enlivened by melodramatic flourishes. A genuinely intriguing mystery rather than a half-baked whodunit devoid of psychological complexity wouldn’t hurt either.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,11/13/2012
The Mystery of Edwin Drood,7,Theater Review: The Mystery of Edwin Drood,"Drood, ultimately, is not a complete show so much as an expandable playspace, and with performers of this caliber, an evening of yeasty, nudge-nudge-wink-wink British good humor is more or less guaranteed. The show-within-the-show may drone a bit, but the show-around-the-show sparkles.",Vulture,Scott Brown,11/13/2012
The Mystery of Edwin Drood,7,STAGE REVIEW The Mystery of Edwin Drood,"Edwin Drood's chief claim to fame is Holmes' clever script, particularly his ingenious means of handling the fact that Dickens never wrote the material for the final act. So Holmes simply stops the show, mid-song, and throws crucial questions — including the identity of whodunit — to the audience to decide by democratic vote. As a result, the cast must prepare multiple versions of the ending, with different lyrics and lines dusted off depending on the outcome of the polling. And there's visible delight on stage when theatergoers make less conventional, Herman Cain-like choices. But as Rivera and her top-vote-getting love interest struggled to stay in character through their melodic seduction — clearly this was a new pairing for the cast — it struck me that the obvious joy of the performers on stage was not always translating across the proscenium. Suspiciously, I have to wonder if this is one entertainment that is just more fun to perform than to watch. B",Entertainment Weekly,Thom Greier,11/13/2012
The Mystery of Edwin Drood,6,'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' Sings Again at Roundabout,"Director Scott Ellis’ edition is brisker and brighter than Wilford Leach’s original, most notably in the performances of Will Chase and Betsy Wolfe as Jasper and Rosa. Chase opts for energetic mustache-twirling and Wolfe sticks with innocent and virginal, though both sing powerfully. In the pants role of Drood, Stephanie Block cavorts with a winking manliness and employs her spectacular voice authoritatively, though she lacks originator Betty Buckley’s sharp edge. Jessie Mueller and Andy Karl milk Helena and Neville’s cartoon exoticism for big laughs, and Gregg Edelman dithers appropriately as Crisparkle. Best are the elegantly authentic Jim Norton, absolutely the equal of the peerless George Rose as the troupe’s leader and our host, and, as Puffer, the playful Chita Rivera, who knows in her bones how to do a star turn despite the worst cockney accent since Dick Van Dyke. The audience I saw “Drood” with adored it, and I suspect most will, so hooray for Roundabout. Alas, the show still makes my teeth hurt.",Backstage,Erik Haagensen,11/13/2012

Maybe this is the ""Iceman"" that Samuel Beckett saw in his mind's eye that led him to write his own masterpieces, particularly ""Waiting for Godot."" Illusion and reality.

Wolfe brings this one in at just under four without significant detriment or noticeable trims. There's still plenty of time to marvel at the fine cast, a solid group of actors who are the sad denizens of a seedy bar/flophouse on Manhattan's West Side.

Everyone lightens up - a bit too much, actually - in the second act, which shoots for comedy. But everything comes together in the third act, which spells Drama with a capital D. The third act is where Hickey divests himself of his own pipedream, ending the play with a gasp-inducing revelation.

That's not present in Wolfe's production, a series of solos, many of them from the horn section. Cuts have been made to the play - it runs nearly four hours, an hour less than other productions - and maybe this has harmed the cohesion, the lived-in-ness.

The theater gods heard, and the re-mounted show is back for a commercial run in one of Broadway's historic jewels, the newly restored Hudson Theater. Under the direction of Sarna Lapine, the staging is more theatrically structured than it was at City Center, with its stools and lecterns.

(George is not a total prig, however, and Gyllenhaal lets loose with some silly business singing the voices of two dogs in the painting.) By contrast, the pointillist's model and lover, the aptly named Dot, played with an endearing blend of comic sparkle and pathos by Annaleigh Ashford, wants the simple pleasures of going to the Follies and eating cream puffs.

Sunday in the Park with George,9,Theater Review: Jake Gyllenhaal in Sunday in the Park With George,"Sunday in the Park with George, which opens tonight in a bare-bones but beautiful-enough Broadway revival starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Annaleigh Ashford, is both a deconstruction and an example of that duality. A deconstruction because Lapine's book, among the brainiest ever written for a musical, works innumerable trenchant variations on the theme of sacrifice for art. The show is also a demonstration of that theme, because Sondheim's songs are so profound that they feel, even while unspooling in unbroken threads of human longing, as if they had left the realm of lived experience and entered a Keatsian plane of absolute truth-beauty far above our own. The lyrics constantly delight the ear while also dramatizing, in that very delight, the way art both exalts and erases.

Gyllenhaal, while properly self-absorbedly as he perennially tries to ""finish the hat,"" gives George an inner gleam of vulnerability and sensitivity which is sometimes overlooked in the role. (Hidden in the script is the comment that the women ""all wanted him and hated him at the same time."")

The downside, though, of the projection of art as personality-killing necessity is that you don't see a lot of possibility for life lived the other way - you know, the functional one with the love, art and kids - and the diminished potential of the road not traveled has the impact of cutting the tension in the piece and compromising one of its most perpetually engaging qualities.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,02/23/2017

Gyllenhaal plays George Seurat, the artist too obsessed with his work to hold onto love. Annaleigh Ashford is Dot, his adoring model. She's full of comedic verve and is shattered by Dot's disappointments. Gyllenhaal's performance is one of quiet brooding and delicate anguish.

The King and I,10,The King and I,"...in a year of bland nostalgic revivals, this grand and glorious production gives you hope in the nonprofit stewardship of our theatrical heritage...let's be frank: Although Hammerstein's characterization of the King has pain and pathos in addition to comic bluster, he speaks a pidgin English that few actors can pull off today. Luckily, the Japanese Watanabe shows a man struggling with a foreign tongue. (His accent can be thick, but that adds authenticity.) The 55-year-old Watanabe also cuts an older figure than Lou Diamond Phillips did in the 1996 revival, which adds gravitas as well as humor to his outbursts and temper tantrums. O'Hara sounds angelic as ever...her silky, shimmering soprano a treasure -- and the role plays to her strengths: wryness, warmth and quiet dignity. Sher directs her and the rest of an exceptionally good cast...with palpable respect for the material and a care to avoid orientalist humbug.",TimeOut NY,David Cote,04/16/2015

Mr. Sher and his leading players also investigate undercurrents of romance and physical attraction which were not evident in the original production...Sher enhances these undercurrents, and has his actors act on them...That this works so well--and adds an additional color to the tapestry of the show--is due in part to the acting. Ms. O'Hara seems to have been born to play musical theatre heroines like Anna, Nellie Forbush and Julie Jordan; if only people were still writing such roles. Her Anna is young and hot-blooded enough to respond to the emotion, although unable...to act on it.

As he did with the company's transcendent South Pacific seven years ago, director Bartlett Sher banishes even the faintest trace of mid-century quaintness or patronizing exoticism from the material, treating the 1951 Rodgers & Hammerstein classic with unimpeachable dramatic integrity and emotional authenticity that are equaled by this landmark production's exquisite musicianship and vocals. As for the superlative leads, Kelli O'Hara and Ken Watanabe, to say they are outstanding seems almost unfair given the uniform excellence of the massive ensemble.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/16/2015

The coupling of the actor with O'Hara as the English schoolteacher is inspired -- full of aching attraction and the impossible tension of smart, beautiful people from different worlds. O'Hara, with her silvery pinpoint vocal precision and her natural empathy, creates an Anna of fierce, caring intelligence. Watanabe, who shaved his head but is nothing like Brynner, is imposingly tall, masculine yet enormously vulnerable as the ruler of an isolated, male-dominated world and whose doubts about modernization eventually break both their hearts...How good to be getting to know the show all over again.",Newsday,Linda Winer,04/16/2015
The King and I,9,New 'King and I' is something wonderful,"There are moments in Lincoln Center Theater's ravishing new Broadway production of The King and I (***½ out of four) that may leave you grinning so hard your face will hurt. Then suddenly, without warning, you'll be fighting off tears...The one element missing from this new revival is a rock-solid leading man. Making his Broadway debut as the King of Siam, Japanese film star Ken Watanabe doesn't yet hold the stage with complete confidence, or enunciate all of his lines clearly. But his performance is brave, underlining the character's hidden vulnerability, and at times disarmingly playful. Sparring with and teasing Anna, his King can convey an almost childlike sense of mischief, and wonder. O'Hara complements and supports her co-star with a study in effortless poise, singing and acting with gorgeous subtlety. There is nothing forced or strident about this Anna; when she stands up to the King -- defying his attitudes about women, and his apparent need to demean his subjects -- her indignation is made more powerful by her sustained grace.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,04/16/2015

Firm but not priggish, touching but never sentimental, she stands up to Mr. Watanabe like a redwood to a tornado...The supporting cast is sterling, and Mr. Sher's detailed character work repays close study: Every part, right down to the smallest of the children, is endowed with strong and clear individuality...Ted Sperling's 28-piece pit band plays Robert Russell Bennett's original 1951 orchestrations, which glitter and shine.

Her warm, occasionally bemused poise makes her a fine fit for Anna Leonowens...The music is simply divine. The cast appears to be just as transported as we are, their voices ringing with heartfelt emotion. And yet we're one element short of perfection -- and that's the king. Watanabe...cuts an imposing figure but plays the ruler broadly, overemphasizing a comic petulance that leaves little room for stately gravitas...There's not even a hint of a romantic spark with Anna...But so strong is the rest of this show that, even with a relatively weak performance by the king, you're still getting the royal treatment.",NY Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,04/16/2015
The King and I,9,The King and I on Broadway: EW review,"If this production has put the romantic passion of the tale on a bit of simmer, it has boosted the overall theme of intersocietal behavior and respect. ""Getting to Know You"", for example, has never seemed more relevant to the score. In this production, it's not a mere classroom charm-song one-off, but an outward reflection of the uneasy feelings the characters are struggling with in that moment...The gender politics involving Anna, Lady Thiang and Tuptim also feel deeply resonant here. Without hammering away at the point too impulsively, Sher's intents seem to sway the story back to a uniquely feminist state of mind...Watanabe is a charismatic and relatively subdued King, but often very hard to decipher; his big number ""A Puzzlement"" ends up being just that. Strangely though, the latter's surface debit sometimes works to some advantage--after all, the King is a man struggling with the ability to fully connect to others. O'Hara could bring out the romantic swoon in just about any male costar, and Anna is another triumph in her winsome recent gallery of fine portrayals.

Plus, O'Hara's Anna is nearly as headstrong as he...Watanabe doesn't dominate the show like Brynner. He's regal, but he's also far more vulnerable, and as performed here, he wills his own death, almost as if a suicide.

Ken Watanabe...is a captivating actor, blazing-eyed and sharp as he portrays the virile character's single-mindedness, playful side and the childlike temper of one who has never been contradicted...Watanabe's diction could occasionally be clearer, his singing more confident and his bearing imbued with more gravity. For her part, although O'Hara builds a rich, likeable character, she does not sound quite as vocally lush as she did last season in ""The Bridges of Madison County."" Still, as they find their ideals in conflict, they make worthy adversaries, and also find real chemistry.

But also give full marks to the first-rate Ruthie Ann Miles...who, as the King's chief wife, turns ""Something Wonderful"" into an exquisite expression of romantic realism that could be the show's anthem. The person she's singing about with such fond ambivalence...is the King himself, embodied here by Mr. Watanabe with the convincing exasperation of a majesty under siege...his big solos, while attacked with ardor, should become even stronger as his pronunciation improves. But he sure comes across when it really counts...As played by Ms. O'Hara, [Anna's] a smart, scrappy, willful pragmatist who also happens to know that love is often as strange as it is undeniable.

Watanabe...delivers a layered performance despite some difficulties enunciating English...His king is, by turns, mischievous and morose, and generally commanding except for some distractingly childish moments...Watanabe is quite natural in the role, and creates a pleasing chemistry with O'Hara as their characters establish a friendship despite obstacles...If you can accept the king's personality quirks, this production of ""The King and I"" is definitely something wonderful.",Associated Press,Jennifer Farrar,04/16/2015

O'Hara's voice is in prime operatic form throughout, rivaled only by her ability to waltz in Catherine Zuber's lavish, flowing gowns. I had mixed feelings about Watanabe's performance...Watanabe's got the imperiousness down pat, but he's falling back on enough of his Japanese accent that it makes some of his line readings difficult to parse...It's not a fatal flaw, whatever you've read in the chat rooms.

But Anna also gives her the opportunity to dispense with the niceness that has sometimes threatened to flatten her stage persona.

The score, which includes such chart-topping hits of the '60s and '70s as ""My Girl"" and ""Papa Was a Rollin' Stone,"" is terrific, as are the singing and pit band, but Sergio Trujillo's choreography is way too slick-the real-life Temptations moved like street-corner kids from Detroit, not glammed-up 42nd Street gypsies-and the projection-heavy set design is ploddingly dull.

But Des McAnuff and choreographer Sergio Trujillo, who also collaborated on Jersey Boys, keep things speeding along: The conveyer belts and turntables of Robert Brill's set are hardly ever still, and the dancing represents a highly amped-up version of the Temptations' actual moves (sometimes at a slight cost to vocal precision). The songs do their work, and the ensemble casts shines whenever it gets a chance; Rashidra Scott makes an impression as Otis's ex-wife, for example, as does Saint Aubyn as Ruffin's peevish replacement, Dennis Edwards.

Even with source material as glorious as ""My Girl,"" ""Just My Imagination,"" ""Papa Was A Rolling Stone"" and the song that gives this production its title, the result feels less celebratory than ruthlessly efficient, like the treadmill device that's forever moving the ever-changing Temptations line-up on, off and around the Imperial Theatre's stage.",Deadline,Greg Evans,03/21/2019

The ushers who seat you for Ain't Too Proud encourage you to clap, sing along, and respond to the show, and looking around, I could tell that my audience was hungry to do so. This was a house of fans. They wanted a nostalgic blowout concert, and as so many songs peeped in and out without a real finish, you could feel their applause anxiety growing. You can't build a whole musical out of climaxes, but you also don't want a house full of blue balls. And when the big finishes do come around, they don't quite smash through the ceiling. They're pleasing without being rapturous.",Vulture,Sara Holdren,03/21/2019
Aladdin,9,It's genie-us! 'Aladdin' rubs you the right way,"You may recognize the song from the 1992 animated movie on which this new musical, which opened Thursday at the New Amsterdam Theatre, is based. In the film version, Friend is sung by Robin Williams, voicing the role of the genie who comes to our titular hero's aid, at his most breathlessly ebullient. It's an act that would be impossible to reproduce, so Iglehart, abetted by director/choreographer Casey Nicholaw, simply tops it. By the end of the number - which includes a game-show segment, a medley of tunes from other Disney musicals and a succession of winking, twinkling chorus lines - Iglehart's Genie is deliriously huffing and puffing; the audience, which responded at a recent preview with a standing ovation, is just as giddy.

But this latest musical adapted from one of Disney's popular movies, which opened on Thursday night at the New Amsterdam Theater, defied my dour expectations. As directed and choreographed (and choreographed, and choreographed) by Casey Nicholaw, and adapted by the book writer Chad Beguelin, ""Aladdin"" has an infectious and only mildly syrupy spirit.

Aladdin,8,"Review: Disney hits magic again with 'Aladdin' on Broadway, thanks to a new Genie","It's spritely directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw, well sung by a huge 35-person cast wearing an alarming number of harem pants, and hits that sweet spot Disney Theatrical Productions do so well, a saccharine fairy tale for the kids cut by some sly, vinegary quips for their parents...Adam Jacobs stars as a sweet, hunky Aladdin -- or ""Al"" as he's called -- and Courtney Reed is his stunning-looking Jasmine, in a little need of some theatrical seasoning but with grooming seemingly straight off Bravo's ""Shahs of Sunset."" A welcome bit of casting is having Jonathan Freeman return as Jafar, the same role he voiced in the animated film. He is simply delicious, relishing his evilhood. One of the biggest obstacles into turning this property into a stage musical has been the blue elephant in the room, the Genie. How can you possibly have a real actor play the shape-shifting, manic talking spirit that Robin Williams so wonderfully portrayed on film? You apparently hire Iglehart, a cartwheeling, high kicking big man who can sing and goof. His extended scene in a cave prompts some theatergoers to give him a standing ovation -- and the show's not even half over.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,03/20/2014
Aladdin,8,'Aladdin' Proves Its Worth on Broadway,"Billing notwithstanding, the real star of ""Aladdin"" is James Monroe Iglehart, who plays the guy in the lamp, a part that was voiced in the movie by Robin Williams at his most frenetic. Mr. Iglehart is just as energetic, though his approach is different: His Genie is a hopped-up cross between Fats Waller and Cab Calloway. (Not surprisingly, he looks stupendous in an aquamarine zoot suit.) ""Friend Like Me,"" his big first-act number, comes within a cat's whisker of stopping the show. The trouble is that nothing else in the first act can touch it. Adam Jacobs and Courtney Reed, who play Aladdin and his princess, are pretty but bland, and the temperature doesn't start rising again until the magic-carpet ride, which comes after intermission and is the slickest thing to hit Broadway since the flying car in ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."" From then on, ""Aladdin"" becomes fun and stays that way.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,03/20/2014
Aladdin,8,Aisle View: Brass Lamp Turns Gold,"Director/choreographer Nicholaw (of Book of Mormon) is one of Broadway's top musical comedy guys nowadays, as demonstrated by ""Friend Like Me."" The rest of his first act, though, seems restrained and merely atmospheric. The scenery by Bob Crowley is effective, but without the extra-special touch he has brought to various projects in the past (including Mary Poppins and this season's Glass Menagerie). The always-expert Natasha Katz creates magical images with her lighting, while Gregg Barnes (of Follies and Kinky Boots) outdoes himself with costumes that bring new meaning to the word resplendent. The sound, though, is so over-amplified that it obscures what are probably first-rate orchestrations by Danny Troob. Score Aladdin a considerable win for Disney, likely to fill the New Amsterdam with happy crowds for seasons to come. Better than Little Mermaid, Aida and Tarzan, though not exactly a knockout.",Huffington Post,Steven Suskin,03/20/2014
Aladdin,8,'Aladdin' Broadway Review: A Smooth Ride for the Family Crowd,"The cartoonish musical is modelled after snappy 1960s Broadway musical comedies, complete with passing scenes staged ""in-one"" in front of a curtain to cover changes in décor. Sure, that's retro, but it suits the light-hearted material as well as a Disney crowd who probably prefers familiar formats. Casey Nicholaw, an ace director-choreographer, maintains a slightly tongue-in-cheek quality throughout the fast-moving show, especially in his frisky dances that, with their sinuous arm gestures, synchronized moves and general acrobatics, often suggest Bollywood production numbers.

But that shouldn't deter audiences from making this splashy Arabian Nights wish-fulfillment fantasy into a family-friendly hit. Directed and choreographed by musical comedy specialist Casey Nicholaw with loads of retro showmanship, an unapologetic embrace of casbah kitsch and a heavy accent on shtick, this is sweet, silly fun.

Aladdin,7,Review: “Aladdin” Will Leave You Dreaming Of Genie,"Don't be fooled by the title of Disney's latest film-to-stage transfer. ""Aladdin"" may be named after its lead street urchin character, but the musical comedy that just opened at the New Amsterdam Theatre is all about one character: the Genie. That's due to the casting of the energetic James Monroe Iglehart, who all but erases the memory of Robin Williams, the voice of the Genie in the 1992 animated film. It's rare that you see an actor playing a character he was born to play in a career-defining performance. Iglehart, last seen on Broadway in ""Memphis,"" uses his background in improv to create a comedic and charismatic Genie, who's equal parts Fats Waller, Luther Vandross and Oprah Winfrey (""You get a wish! You get a wish!""). Iglehart is so outstanding as Genie that his take on ""Friend Like Me"" stopped the performance I attended with thunderous applause and a standing ovation. It's the number you'll leave the theater talking about.",NBC New York,Dave Quinn,03/20/2014

James Monroe Iglehart is the embodiment here of the role Robin Williams voiced in the 1992 movie, and schtick for schtick and wisecrack for wisecrack, the performance very much keeps to the hyper-caffeinated pace Williams set. If Tonys were given in the category of energy output, they'd award Iglehart three. He is in fact-and no surprise here-the most enjoyable ingredient of director Casey Nicholaw's production, which despite a lot of huffing and puffing and brandishing of scimitars exposes more of the material's rough patches than it does any happier conceits.",Washington Post,Peter Marks,03/20/2014
Aladdin,7,"Theater Review: Disney's Same Old World, Back in Aladdin","For Aladdin, Disney's team builds on the take-no-chances, take-no-prisoners lessons of its six Broadway predecessors to all but guarantee a quality hit: if not a Lion King, at least not a Tarzan. They wrote the book on this sort of thing, and now, Walt be praised, they're going to heave it at you. This is not as unpleasant an experience as it sounds; if you're up for a meaningless fling, it might as well be with a pro... If the whole enterprise is arranged to prevent us from taking anything seriously, why should we respond when we're suddenly asked to care? (Spamalot didn't ask us to.) This also makes the romantic roles mostly unactable, at least by the stiff cuties Disney favors...So here's a new fantastic point of view: What if Disney applied its unparalleled know-how to stories that are not reducible to needlepoint truths at the first act curtain? Aladdin will surely be another of its successes; I hope it is. But what if it put its corporate muscle and smarts behind an artist instead of a franchise? What if they gave us a new West Side Story or Gypsy, instead of just quoting them for anachronistic laughs?",Vulture,Jesse Green,03/20/2014

That would be James Monroe Iglehart, in the role memorably voiced by Robin Williams in the 1992 animated hit. Every time this Genie's on stage, it's as if ""Aladdin"" were mainlining Red Bull. Iglehart works so hard during his big number, you fear for his health - that is, when you're not laughing your head off. And then there's the rest of the show...The whole vibe is like a throwback to those old Bob Hope/Bing Crosby movies: ""The Road to Agrabah.""

Beetlejuice,2,"‘Beetlejuice’ review: Musical is a coke-snorting, F-bombing disaster","Most of the cast overplays (Butler, Kritzer) or underplays (McClure, Dannheisser), but the talented Caruso, with a Cyndi Lauper-like voice, strikes the right balance. This is a challenge for all involved, especially in the second half of Scott Brown and Anthony King's jumbled book. Indeed, if the actors took their scripts, threw them into the air, picked up the pages and performed them in their new order, Act 2 would be about the same.

Betrayal,9,Review: Tom Hiddleston in a Love Triangle Undone by ‘Betrayal’,"Mr. Lloyd's interpretation balances surface elegance with an aching profundity, so that ""Betrayal"" becomes less about the anguish of love than of life itself.

Betrayal,9,BWW Review: Director Jamie Lloyd's Subtle Way With Harold Pinter's BETRAYAL Makes For Riveting Storytelling,"The verbal thrills of Pinter's text arise from the fact that his characters are educated, literary people, well versed in the power of words - and the silences in between them - to attack and humiliate. But what is also revealed by the tightly wound ensemble under Lloyd's guidance is that, despite the play's title, this is also a romantic tragedy, though one played out with carefully restrained emotions. One person's act of Betrayal can be another's act of uncontrolled desire.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,09/05/2019
Betrayal,9,Broadway Review: ‘Betrayal’ With Tom Hiddleston,"Director Jamie Lloyd's impeccable direction - now on Broadway, after a hot-ticket London run - strips Pinter's 1978 play to its bare bones: the excruciating examination of the slow death of a marriage.

In Jamie Lloyd's masterful revival of Harold Pinter's Betrayal - one is tempted to call it a reinvention, so deeply and definitely urgent is his take - three of the ever-shifting betrayers and betrayees occupy the stage at all times, one or another bearing silent witness as the other two enact an affair's all-too-familiar scenes of lies, transgressions, excitement and the love that, at least fleetingly, prompts it all.",Deadline,Greg Evans,09/05/2019
Betrayal,9,'Betrayal': Theater Review,"Reverse chronology has become a familiar narrative device in film, but when Harold Pinter employed it in 1978 in his blisteringly personal drama about an extramarital affair, Betrayal, it was still uncommon enough to become highly influential. It makes the drama start from a place of awkwardness steeped in grief, two years after the illicit liaison has finished, and end at the beginning, with a rapturous sense of secret possibility, marbled by the deep vein of melancholy present from the first scene.

Betrayal,9,Theater Review: A High-Powered New Betrayal,"Despite the real power of Hiddleston's performance, that empathy gap strikes me as a flaw. We can't quite take Emma at her word (we've also heard her lie on other important matters), and so the scales of Lloyd's play end up tipped rather than balanced. It seems to be a play about a victim and two perpetrators - but I think it's a play about three people, all of whom we should empathize with, all of whom we should mistrust, all of whom are capable of great selfishness. Ashton has the hardest job: Emma's got that sense of mystery about her that sometimes happens when men, even very talented men, write women. The scenes between Robert and Jerry, though often tense and terse, feel lived, red-blooded, affectionate. Emma often seems ethereal - her motivations and actual desires somehow far away. (For a real bust-up of that trope, get into Bakewell's essay - there's no mystery woman there; instead there's a super-smart Cambridge grad who was expected to become a housewife and mother at 25.) The character is already the most opaque in the play, and Ashton's performance doesn't do much to elucidate her. Tall and willowy, with bare feet and a dancer's limbs, she tucks her hair behind her ears, tilts her head and half smiles. It's clear she likes Jerry's attention, but it's not clear where her own deep hungers lie. Lloyd has her leaning into the enigmatic aura Pinter gave Emma, and it renders Ashton less visceral and-and this is the real problem-less sympathetic than her male counterparts.",Vulture,Sara Holdren,09/05/2019

Betrayal,8,When Superheroes Take the Stage,"Betrayal is best when played as a teasing, slightly sinister comedy, as it was in a 2000 Broadway production in which then little-known John Slattery played Robert and made the most of it, stealing the show from his co-stars Juliette Binoche and Liev Schreiber. Hiddleston is a fine actor and gets some laughs out of the part as Robert toys with the other two, but he spends much of the play seeming forlorn where Slattery was impish, which is why this staging drags a bit even at an abbreviated 90 minutes. Cox, meanwhile, is more than adequate as the duplicitous friend, but Emma Ashton merely comes across as sweet and slightly passive. She hardly seems worth anyone's trouble, and I'm not sure the play does either.",National Review,Kyle Smith,09/05/2019

Meanwhile, Cox is a guy plenty of audience members would gladly leave their husbands for.",New York Post,Johnny Oleksinski,09/05/2019

In each of the two-person scenes, the absent character lingers onstage like a gloomy ghost, sometimes nursing a drink. Everything seems intended to suggest the very English repression of great passions that the play never actually conveys. At the performance I attended, Hiddleston's icy facade cracked-during the scene in which he discovers his wife's adultery-to release a physical outpouring of fluid so profuse that it seemed like a magic trick, as though the actor had swiftly turned on and off a faucet that was hidden in his face. It was a strange and incongruous moment, and it provided a welcome burst of surprise in a production that is otherwise a chic and dreary affair.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,09/05/2019

It makes a difference, though, when the hustle involves a cast of top-flight artists perfectly mated to their parts and some of the sexiest, most sophisticated dancing seen on Broadway in years. By the time the priceless Bebe Neuwirth, playing a hoofer turned murderer, greets the audience at the beginning of the second act with the salutation 'Hello, suckers!,' it's a label we're all too happy to accept.

The helpers of Come From Away were not in a position to risk their lives on that tragic day, but they were given the opportunity to open their hearts and, as dramatized on the Schoenfeld stage, they gloriously did so....As a theatre critic, I'm often asked by people I meet for recommendations. Before answering, I always ask what kind of plays or musicals they usually like, so I can match them up with something they'd more likely enjoy.

Come From Away,9,Review: How ‘Come From Away’ Makes a Broadway Musical Out of 9/11,"Come From Away is more a rambunctious, musical exhalation rather than a deep and thoughtful examination. It's a snapshot of lives far from New York and D.C. in flux. 9/11 is not the show's focus or even default focus: it is simply the event that has brought these people together. The show now finds itself in New York, site of the most iconic tragedy of that day-and a cheery rock-musical about 9/11 may not be the first theatrical choice for those to whom the city has long been home and who may have their own complex relationship to 9/11. For some, maybe the musical itself strikes a bum note: it is not set here, and it is not directly about the human tragedy of that day. But Come From Away doesn't trivialize the events of 9/11 or seek to facetiously co-opt them. It is as simple in its focus as the acts of goodness and gratitude at its thematic core.",Daily Beast,Tim Teeman,03/12/2017
Come From Away,9,Theater review: A 9/11 tale of epic kindness,"Imagine a musical, based on a true story, that celebrates kindness and charity toward distressed foreigners. At a moment in history when certain politicians are telling us to fear and reject immigrants, we're shown ordinary people who act spontaneously out of a concern for others. Come from Away, which opened Sunday at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, doesn't have an ironic or cynical bone in its body. It's a celebration of the best human instincts, and, particularly coming at this time, doesn't seem at all hokey. It's cheering and refreshing.",The Record,Robert Feldberg,03/12/2017

But even the most stalwart cynics may have trouble staying dry-eyed during this portrait of heroic hospitality under extraordinary pressure...this Canadian-born production, written by Irene Sankoff and David Hein and directed by Christopher Ashley, is as honorable in its intentions as it is forthright in its sentimentality. And it may provide just the catharsis you need in an American moment notorious for dishonorable and divisive behavior...the show - based on interviews with the people who inspired it - covers a vast expanse of sensitive material with a respect for its complexity. It understands that much of what it portrays is guaranteed to stir fraught memories among many of us. And it mostly refrains from overegging what could have been a treacly, tear-salted pudding. Instead, it sustains an air of improvisational urgency, which feels appropriate to a show about making do in crisis, and it doesn't linger on obvious moments of heartbreak and humanity.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,03/12/2017
Come From Away,8,'Come From Away' Proves a Dignified 9/11 Musical,"Colella's melodic solo, ""Me and the Sky,"" is a high point in a show where the songs are consistently interesting...Some of the characters are real; others are recognized to be composite sketches of the people whom writers Irene Sankoff and David Hein met during a 10th anniversary reunion in Newfoundland. Inevitably, many of the portrayals feel like stock characters-the blustery mayor, etc.-but the acting is excellent all around...There was discipline used here. There's no footage of burning towers, crashing planes or falling bodies. ""Come From Away"" manages to find a spiritual angle to a horrific story, depicting the goodness in humanity while still allowing us room for the feelings of loneliness and fear that will always be connected to that time.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,03/12/2017
Come From Away,8,Come From Away: EW stage review,"If you're an out-of-town visitor to New York looking for a feel-good night of theater, then Come From Away is surely recommended. This new musical tells the true story of how the residents of Gander, a Newfoundland island community of some 9000 people, responded with unparalleled Canadian hospitality to 7,000 stranded international passengers whose planes were diverted when the U.S. airspace closed on Sept. 11, 2001.

Come From Away,8,'Come From Away': Theater Review,"The true-life story that inspired the new musical Come From Away would seem like the stuff of a Frank Capra movie. The show relates the tale of how a small Newfoundland town in 2001 found itself unexpectedly hosting 7,000 airline passengers stranded there for days after 9/11. But though the material might have lent itself to sickly sweet sentimentality, creators Irene Sankoff and David Hein have crafted a heartwarming and thoroughly entertaining musical. Especially in these politically fractious times, it should prove a true crowd-pleaser on Broadway following previous hit engagements in San Diego, Washington D.C. and Toronto.",Hollywood Reporter,Frank Scheck,03/12/2017
Come From Away,8,New musical 'Come From Away' has warm Canadian memories for our dark times,"Come From Away will not be remembered for its distinguished score, the rousing exuberance of several of its Celtic-rooted numbers notwithstanding. It will not be remembered for the poetry of its book nor for its sophisticated examination of human behavior in rural communities. Rather, it is determined, with good humor and generous Canadian self-deprecation, to remind us of one of the few happy stories to emerge from that terrible day. There are a few moments of conflict with an Egyptian passenger on a day of much mistrust, but they are resolved with relative ease. The Gander of Come From Away takes a while to learn how to be kind to its visitors, but it sure figures it out. Over donuts at Tim Hortons.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,03/12/2017
Come From Away,8,Broadway review: Come from Away takes off on Broadway,"Although the residual shock of 9/11 gives it a strong current of emotion, Come from Away's multiple narratives mostly have low stakes; it's essentially a show about a bunch of people inconvenienced at once. When it touches on weightier concerns-one passenger is the mother of a missing firefighter-it falters; it is better at celebrating less consequential things, like a rowdy evening of initiation at a local bar, where the visitors are urged to kiss a cod and try a local rum called screech. A band of eight plays the spirited, Celtic-accented score, heavy on fiddle and bodhran and flute. Under Christopher Ashley's fluid direction, the 12 versatile actors form a true ensemble cast, playing dozens of roles as both the Plane People and the plain people who welcome them to their rock...Despite minor stumbles of craft, Come from Away makes a persuasive case for the value of good intentions. For this kind of uplift you don't need planes.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,03/12/2017

While rousing and rich in harmony, the music suffers from sameness and a sound mix that obscures lyrics. Director Christopher Ashley guides the excellent cast and energizing staging.

Come From Away,8,‘Come From Away’ comes in for an exuberant Broadway landing,"The lump that forms in your throat in the opening minutes of ""Come From Away"" - and remains lodged there for 100 buoyant minutes more - is the physiological confirmation that this effervescent musical, enveloped in Canadian good will, is an antidote for what ails the American soul...The alternating stories of the townspeople and the strangers in their midst - all played by a dozen superbly cast actors - are communicated vivaciously by book and songwriters Irene Sankoff and David Hein, in a bracingly kinetic production directed by Christopher Ashley, doing some of the most impressive work of his career. With the arrival of ""Come From Away"" to Broadway's 2016-17 season, joining such accomplished new shows as ""Dear Evan Hansen"" and ""Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812,""the Tony race for best musical of the year just got interesting.",Washington Post,Peter Marks,03/12/2017

Had the theater finally found a way to sing and dance with dignity regarding 9/11, a catastrophe that has, thus far, been the third rail of theatergoers' emotions? Well, ""Come From Away"" may not be Broadway's first feel-good musical about the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, but it is a feel-pretty-nice musical.

Come From Away,8,Review: ‘Come From Away’ Unearths Joy From The Ashes Of 9/11,"Hein and Sarnoff are not Sondheim. The folksy songs in Come From Away are nearly all expository rather than revelatory (a key exception being the coming-of-age number ""Me And The Sky,"" sung with perfect fervor by Jenn Colella as Beverley Bass, the first female captain of a commercial airline). The show, staged with kinetic enthusiasm by Christopher Ashley with Kelly Devine, positively reeks of integrity - positive being the operative word. In the company of 16, nearly all play multiple roles. The standouts, in addition to Colella, are Kendra Kassebaum as a novice reporter, Chad Kimball and Caesar Samayoa as boyfriends named Kevin, Rodney Hicks as a skeptic finally undone by generosity, and Astrid Van Wieren as a voice of reason.

Come From Away,7,Theater Review: Come From Away Makes a Musical Out of Canadian Niceness,"That a story is basically true does not make it more believable onstage...Not helping matters is the ambitious number of stories the show wants to tell. The cast of 12 plays at least 40 roles, both locals and plane people, most of them whizzing past our attention too quickly and indistinguishably (despite Toni-Leslie James's clever quick-change costume elements) to make lasting impressions. Even when they do, the show's pageantlike structure, in which bits of story are connected by setting and theme rather than by action, prevents those impressions from deepening over time the way they must. There's a lot of snow in Gander but no accumulation. To make up for it, the production, tightly directed by Christopher Ashley, with a handsome woodsy set by Beowulf Boritt and fine lighting by Howell Binkley, does its damnedest to knock you into submission. The songs, also by Sankoff and Hein, are pleasant, in a folk-rock-meets-Celtic-revival vein that the show exploits with the mercilessness of a phlebotomist. (Cue the fiddle, bodhran, and uilleann pipes.) There is much spirited if obligatory stomping. (The choreography is by Kelly Devine.)",Vulture,Jesse Green,03/12/2017
Come From Away,7,"Come From Away’ Broadway Review: Stranded in Newfoundland, as Well as the Theater","Sankoff and Hein's book tries to drum up suspense in the show's opening scenes by telling us that few of these visitors to Gander knew about the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, because few people back then owned cell phones. Really? As songwriters, this duo relies on a strong percussive element that's so incessant that their songs take on a militaristic flair. And they're also very, very loud. Gareth Owen's sound design is the most abrasive to grace a Broadway stage since the entry of ""Waitress"" a year ago. Dialogue is shrill and disembodied from the actors, and when the ensemble sings any of the show's foot-stomping anthems, the lyrics are indecipherable. Come from Away is a musical about hope, perseverance and people coming together to help each other in difficult times. The Gander townspeople have much in common with the citizens of Meredith Willson's River City, only they're much more adorable.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,03/12/2017
Dear Evan Hansen,10,Broadway review: Dear Evan Hansen is lit by a dazzling star turn,"What does it look like when a star is born? In the case of Ben Platt, the astonishing young actor who plays the title role in Dear Evan Hansen, it's a bit like an actual birth: beautiful but strange and wet, tinged with confusion and danger. Evan is painfully introverted; he has no friends in high school, and even the thought of talking to a girl he likes, Zoe (the poignantly unaffected Laura Dreyfuss), makes his palms perspire. Platt's performance extends that to his whole body; when he sings, his face often gleams with sweat. Yet the effect is not off-putting; Evan is immensely lovable, even when he makes terrible mistakes. He speaks in rushes of instant regret, as though frantically digging a hole to bury himself in, and his intense awkwardness is filtered through first-rate comic timing, high-wire dramatic acting and a gorgeously expressive tenor voice.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,12/04/2016
Dear Evan Hansen,10,"Theater Review: Dear Evan Hansen Moves Uptown, and Gains Something Indefinable","The big problem in writing great musicals is not the difficulty of writing great songs. The big problem is that the songs, great or not, are cannibals, picking the stories clean and leaving a pile of bones. It's a zero-sum system. In musical dramas the problem is even worse, as innumerable failed adaptations of huge 18th-century novels have proved. (They often seem like Cliffs Notes of Cliffs Notes.) But when a musical drama clicks, an amazing fusion event occurs: The songs and the story enlarge each other in the process of becoming inseparable. Think of Sweeney Todd or, more intimately, Fun Home. And now add to the list Dear Evan Hansen, which opened tonight in a production beautifully directed by Michael Greif. I called the Off Broadway production at Second Stage this May ""the feel-anxious musical of the season.""

Well, it doesn't supply what you might expect from some musicals and dramas about teen suicide, our truth-dissembling online worlds, and an extreme case of fabulism.

Ms. Mitchell's songs are beautiful but undramatic-the score runs mainly to slow and medium tempos-which means that the overall narrative pace can feel a bit sluggish, enthralling though it is from moment to moment. Even at its frequent best, ""Hadestown"" plays more like a song cycle than a stage show.

Hadestown,6,‘Hadestown’ Tries Like Hell to Spin a Concept Album on Broadway,"Silver fox André De Shields lends his funky-grandpa vibe to the narration-heavy role of Hermes. Big-voiced Eva Noblezada is pluck personified as a waifish Eurydice. Fitting for the god of the underworld, Patrick Page's basso profundo seems to issue from the lower basement. And, as Persephone, Amber Grey dials her devil-may-care hootchie-mama routine to 11, ensuring her eventual transfiguration as Eartha Kitt on Broadway one day. Less fruitful is Reeve Carney's Orpheus, conceived as a socially awkward art savant. Laying on the Dear Evan Hansen too thick, Carney's neurodiverse Orpheus (lots of gaping, arms hanging limply, fingers twitching) is a misfire. The survivor of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark remains a bit generic, despite sweet looks and a pretty pop falsetto. Hadestown needs a stronger injection of sexually charged romance.",Observer,David Cote,04/17/2019
Hadestown,5,‘Hadestown’ review: Broadway douses the fires of hell with folk music,"Yes, composer Anaïs Mitchell's musical retelling of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, which opened Wednesday on Broadway, sounds pleasant and looks more expensive than it did in 2016 at New York Theatre Workshop. But this classic tale of love - he looks back, she gets trapped in the underworld for all eternity - is still too slick and sterile for us to give a damn about her damnation.",New York Post,Johnny Oleksinski,04/17/2019
Hamilton,10,"Review: ‘Hamilton,’ Young Rebels Changing History and Theater","A show about young rebels grabbing and shaping the future of an unformed country, ""Hamilton"" is making its own resonant history by changing the language of musicals. And it does so by insisting that the forms of song most frequently heard on pop radio stations in recent years -- rap, hip-hop, R&B ballads -- have both the narrative force and the emotional interiority to propel a hefty musical about long-dead white men whose solemn faces glower from the green bills in our wallets...But these guys don't exactly look like the marble statues of the men they're portraying...when they open their mouths, the words that tumble out are a fervid mix of contemporary street talk, wild and florid declarations of ambition and, oh yes, elegant phrases from momentous political documents you studied in school...And you never doubt for a second that these eclectic words don't belong in proximity to one another...Mr. Miranda's Hamilton, a propulsive mix of hubris and insecurity, may be the center of the show. But he is not its star. That would be history itself, that collision of time and character that molds the fates of nations and their inhabitants.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,08/06/2015
Hamilton,10,BWW Reviews: HAMILTON Takes a Shot at Broadway,"The hottest ticket in town at The Public, Hamilton has only grown as a phenomenon with its move to Broadway, with its web site advising customers that good seats will start becoming available in January. And while some have pondered if Hamilton's success signals Broadway's greater acceptance of diverse contemporary music, the musical's major appeal is as old as Rodgers and Hammerstein: good writing. They loved it in the 1700s, and they're loving it now.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,08/06/2015
Hamilton,10,'Hamilton': Theater Review,"The almost entirely sung-through show is remarkably faithful to the historical facts, packing immense amounts of detail into its sprawling narrative. But it does so in such riotously entertaining fashion that it never feels like a history lesson, although it surely delivers one...Largely unaltered from its original production save for one important cast change, the lyrically dense show makes an even greater impact on the large Broadway stage, which provides ample room for its large ensemble. The performers have only gotten better, with Miranda in the title role...delivering a commanding star turn that is as charismatic as it is emotionally affecting. But there's also terrific work from Leslie Odom, Jr. as the scheming Burr, stopping the show with the rousing number ""The Room Where It Happens""...The musical is a triumph...More to the point, it signals its immensely talented creator and star as a game-changing figure in musical theater.",Hollywood Reporter,Frank Scheck,08/06/2015
Hamilton,10,‘Hamilton’ Review: The Revolution Moves Uptown,"""Hamilton"" is the best and most important Broadway musical of the past decade...there is nothing quaint about the deeply thoughtful way in which Mr. Miranda has interwoven the tension between Hamilton's personal ambition and sense of national mission with the parallel capacity of his fellow framers to balance realism with idealism. Check out, for instance, ""The Room Where It Happens,"" the spectacular second-act production number in which Aaron Burr (Leslie Odom Jr., who has star quality galore) schools the audience in how politicians get things done...the vaulting energy of Mr. Miranda's score sweeps all cavils aside, and Thomas Kail, Andy Blankenbuehler and David Korins, the director, choreographer and set designer, have successfully expanded the scale of the original production without making it top-heavy...The cast, led by Mr. Miranda in the title role, makes the same vibrant and youthful impression that it did downtown. Indeed, everybody in the show from the boss to the ushers exudes the confident air of show folk who know they've got themselves a hit.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,08/06/2015
Hamilton,10,Hamilton,"I love Hamilton. I love it like I love New York, or Broadway when it gets it right. And this is so right. A sublime conjunction of radio-ready hip-hop (as well as R&B, Britpop and trad showstoppers), under-dramatized American history and Miranda's uniquely personal focus as a son of immigrants and as an inexhaustible wordsmith, Hamilton hits multilevel culture buttons, hard...Miranda may be composer-lyricist and star, but the world he creates is vibrantly democratic. Hamilton is the center, but Burr is his equally weighted Judas and Javert-and more complexly drawn than either...Phillipa Soo, playing the betrayed but finally forgiving wife, Eliza, has some of the show's most heartbreaking music...As French ally Lafayette in the first act and a foppish, trash-talking Thomas Jefferson in the second, Daveed Diggs blazes with raffish charisma. Jonathan Groff has inherited the role of King George from Brian d'Arcy James, and finds new levels of comic brilliance in his short but convulsively funny appearances...And the lovely, pure-voiced Renée Elise Goldsberry's Angelica Schuyler will make you demand a spinoff musical all her own. Part of the genius of Miranda's writing is this polyphonic, block-party quality, where everyone gets their say.",TimeOut NY,David Cote,08/06/2015
Hamilton,10,'Hamilton' review: Even better on Broadway,"Instead, the show -- which tells early American history in its own time but shot through with multicultural urban sensibility -- is even more nuanced, more cohesive in individual performances and its more focused finale. Most important, Miranda and director Thomas Kail have fine-tuned it without losing a shiver of its audacity and thrill. The musical -- written and composed by its star -- manages to be radical and satirical, yet good-hearted...The jagged, sly poetry and overlapping storytelling barrel through, dense and fast, except when choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler's lusciously visceral dancers shock us in slow motion. Miranda, who plays Hamilton with wit and an exquisitely endearing inelegance, doesn't preach...However, this is anything but a one-man show. Every supporting character is a vivid personality.",Newsday,Linda Winer,08/06/2015
Hamilton,10,'Hamilton' will win hearts and minds,"But there has been nothing on Broadway in the past 20 years to rival the riveting, exhilarating and haunting Hamilton (**** out of four stars), which...opened Thursday at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, its vitality and ingenuity fully intact...As written and played by Miranda, Hamilton...is a man of ferocious intelligence, enormous drive and devastating flaws. He has the outsize passions of an epic musical hero, and the verbal dexterity and bravado of a rap star; and Miranda's pulsing score and dazzling, piercing rhymes accommodate both...Lacamoire's muscular orchestration mines the melodic pull of Miranda's score, whether the performers are rapping or singing. Blankenbuehler keeps the dancers in almost constant motion, sustaining a sense of urgency that heightens our engagement and excitement.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,08/06/2015
Hamilton,10,‘Hamilton’ review: Musical of founding father Alexander Hamilton soars on Broadway,"With ""Hamilton,"" Broadway is officially the coolest place on the planet. And the smartest. And most exhilarating...It's even richer and more eloquent since its run earlier this year at the Public Theater...Hip hop is one flavor of the score. It's as if the speechmaking Founding Fathers are in the next room. And it's a deft way to depict the often-fractious relationships between these competitive 18th-century power players...But to call this a ""hip hop musical"" is simplistic: rhythm and blues, jazz and Broadway are also part of a work that nods to Rodgers and Hammerstein, Gilbert and Sullivan and beyond. Since the Off-Broadway run, performances have all deepened, including Miranda's. He better conveys Hamilton's cockiness, contrition and all-too-human flaws. The charismatic Daveed Diggs aces his roles and lends laughs as Thomas Jefferson and the French general Lafayette. Jonathan Groff (HBO's ""Looking"") is the picture of pouty petulance as King George III, who appears now and again to warble a Brit-pop tune of vengeance, venom and venality...The breathtaking Renee Elise Goldsberry brings grit and grace as the indomitable Angelica, Hamilton's confidante. As Eliza, the lovely Phillipa Soo captivates with her pure, sweet singing as Hamilton's devoted-despite-everything wife...If only every history lesson -- and Broadway musical -- dazzled so completely.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,08/06/2015
Hamilton,10,Our theater critic comes around to the smash hit 'Hamilton',"I must confess that I gave one of the less enthusiastic reviews of ""Hamilton"" back in February, finding the plot to be too dense (it is, after all, a biography) and the hip-hop sound to be monotonous. On second viewing, I was determined to accept the show on its own terms, and I ended up being absolutely entranced by Miranda's inventive writing, Thomas Kail's masterful direction and Andy Blankenbuehler's nonstop movement. I may be the last critic to join the ""Hamilton"" fan club, but better late than never. Miranda tackles Hamilton's life, as well as the chaos and culture of the Revolutionary War and early years of the Republic, with genuine historical analysis, humor, tenderness and an eye for contemporary relevance.",amNY,Matt Windman,08/06/2015
Hamilton,10,"‘Hamilton’ Opens On Broadway, Bigger And Better Than Ever – Review","Lin-Manuel Miranda's electrifying adaptation of Ron Chernow's celebrated biography of the least-known U.S. Founding Father is not, to use that cliché, a game-changer. It is, in truth, the quintessence of a Broadway musical destined for the record books: Of-the-moment in its rolling, roiling waves of rap used to tell its tale yet timeless in its unembarrassed detours into the sentimental ballads and roof-levitating choral numbers that are Broadway's stock-in-trade...Hamilton is accessible without pandering and inspirational in sneaky ways that permeate a skeptic's shell. Miranda has used well the interregnum between downtown and up, sharpening lyrics, shifting some of the relationships to achieve greater balance and, happily, ignoring suggestions that he trim the show (it clocks in at about two-and-three-quarters hours yet never feels long)...The casting could not be better and the company now wears a multiplicity of roles like second skins. The standout besides Miranda as his own leading man, is Odom, every bit his match as the complex Burr.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,08/06/2015
Hamilton,10,Theater Review: Is Hamilton Even Better Than It Was?,"A second look...suggests that something even more significant is going on. The breakthrough isn't so much the incorporation of those contemporary genres; after all, Miranda already did that, throwing in Latin music to boot, in the charming In the Heights. But Hamilton not only incorporates newish-to-Broadway song forms; it requires and advances them, in the process opening up new territory for exploitation. It's the musical theater, not just American history, that gets refurbished. And perhaps popular music, too...I noticed only a few textual changes since it opened downtown, all smart. The role of the villain, Aaron Burr, has been carefully streamlined...The paradoxical result is that Leslie Odom Jr.'s already excellent performance is even more thrilling...I still wonder, too, if the manic staging by director Thomas Kail and choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler, fun as it is, may sometimes get in the way of the action instead of enhancing it.",Vulture,Jesse Green,08/06/2015
Hamilton,10,'Hamilton': Hip-hop and Founding Fathers in dazzling Broadway musical,"For the Founding Father never had a friend so loyal and true as Lin-Manuel Miranda, whose audaciously ambitious and supremely executed new musical is surely the most entertaining, provocative and moving civics lesson in Broadway history...it's true that the language and nomenclature of ""Hamilton"" feel wildly fresh and distinctive...But what makes Miranda such a uniquely potent Broadway figure is that he also is steeped in the craft and tradition of the American musical and can forge melody and lyrics that hold up to the work of the old masters...Thomas Kail, the immensely skilled director of ""Hamilton,"" not only unleashes all of this excitement with abandon, but he also forges a wholly consistent world, aided by the best work of choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler's career.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,08/06/2015
Hamilton,10,‘Hamilton’ Broadway Review: The Founding Fathers Never Looked or Sounded So Cool,"Yes, ""Hamilton"" is that good, and the still youthful Lin-Manuel Miranda can be mentioned in the same sentence with Sondheim and even Cole Porter.

As for Miranda, I don't recall anyone writing music, lyrics & book and starring in a hit musical since George M. Cohan last gave his regards to Herald Square. Miranda's demonstration of talent, skill and savvy earn him a well-deserved gold star, and a goldmine too.",Huffington Post,Steven Suskin,08/06/2015
Hamilton,9,Review: 'Hamilton' gets even better on its trip to Broadway,"The hip-hop-based musical about Alexander Hamilton, the first treasury secretary of the United States, has gotten even more ""scrappy and hungry"" like its hero...This is a musical often stunning in its audaciousness...Perhaps Act 2 wanders a bit and the ending is a slight let-down. But there's no denying the show's sheer brashness and freshness. It is a revolution: A reclaiming of America's founding story by a multicultural cast using modern music and themes...The standout performances are Leslie Odom Jr. as a wary Aaron Burr, a cautious yin to Hamilton's impulsive yang. Odom throws down a career-defining marker here, graceful and cunning and haunted as both the narrator and the man who will kill Hamilton in 1804. Renee Elise Goldsberry as Hamilton's sister-in-law is glorious as the treasury secretary's secret crush, rapping and singing like a virtuoso, and Phillipa Soo is a tender and swanlike wife to Hamilton...mostly [Miranda} seems to have cut back the historical underbrush that sometimes bogged the show down.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,08/06/2015
Hamilton,9,Broadway Review: ‘Hamilton’,"The wonderful dancing chorus seems to have more room to perform its leaps and bounds, and the individual characters have always been larger than life in the first place. In fact, Leslie Odom Jr. seems even more invested in the difficult character of Aaron Burr, really sinking his teeth into the frustration and yearning that this troubled character reveals...Like any true landmark, ""Hamilton"" stands up to repeated viewings. After six months, the show's initial impact hasn't dulled a bit; in fact, the qualities that made it so extraordinary the first time around are all the more striking...That rapper style, with its interlocking interior rhymes and pounding cadences, perfectly captures Hamilton's feverish intelligence and hyperarticulate manner. But instead of keeping to a single uniform musical style (hip-hop or otherwise), as traditional shows often have, Miranda continues to draw from all available styles and musical sources, from nursery lullaby to rock 'n' roll and operetta, in order to capture the soul of a character and the spirit of the moment. If this sort of thing catches on, the old, reliable Broadway showtune may be a thing of the past.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,08/06/2015
Hamilton,9,Lin-Manuel Miranda Calls the Shots in Majestic 'Hamilton',"""Hamilton"" arrives burnished and proud, though two performances struck me as having evolved considerably from the musical's debut. The first is Leslie Odom Jr.'s Aaron Burr...Odom's Burr is a stop-at-nothing climber obsessed with relevancy, fully exposed when he raps about wanting to be in ""The Room Where It Happens."" Yet somehow, the kinetic Odom makes Burr's admiration for his lifelong rival come through in every scene. Odom is just magnetic here. Enchanting, as well, is Phillipa Soo...as Eliza, Alexander's wife...Daveed Diggs, doing double duty as Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson, is a hyper-caffeinated and charismatic White Rabbit, by way of Willy Wonka. Christopher Jackson's Washington is confident and good-humored. Groff has the crowd on his side and hits all the right notes, even if he appears more of a prince than a king...And of course, there's Miranda...His Hamilton is an astute, painfully flawed free-thinker whose efforts in war and peace inevitably prop up the people in his midst, though his failures are profound on the homefront...Turns out, once you've gotten over the first wow, there's plenty more wow to be uncovered.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,08/06/2015
Hamilton,9,'Hamilton': EW stage review,"Miranda's singular gift for storytelling and wordplay makes even the Federalist Papers sound sexy, but the play's intrigue come mostly from its potent stew of friendship and romance and outsize ambition; it's as if House of Cards were folded into a sort of Days of Our Colonial Lives fever dream, then filtered through the minds of Tupac and Sondheim. It's that strange and that spectacular, and you'd be crazy to miss it. A",Entertainment Weekly,Leah Greenblatt,08/06/2015
Hamilton,8,‘Hamilton’ isn’t quite revolutionary,"But then, there's a lot of love for this energetic telling of the story of Alexander Hamilton...Thomas Kail's direction and Andy Blankenbuehler's choreography is inventive and kinetic, suggesting the story is always in motion on the bilevel wooden set. But ""revolutionary"" the show is not. Truly radical art is divisive, and under its brash exterior, ""Hamilton"" is warmly reassuring -- a love letter to a land of opportunity... ""Hamilton"" shines brightest when it gets into the characters' heads and hearts, especially concerning our hero's personal life -- though those are the scenes in which Miranda's limitations as an actor are obvious. Less effective is the history-with-a-capital-H stuff. Turning political debate into a rap battle is clever, but overall, Hamilton's big-picture importance is diluted...Well, America turned out to have a long, successful run. So, no doubt, will ""Hamilton.""",NY Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,08/06/2015
Mean Girls,8,‘Mean Girls’ review: Tina Fey musical a Broadway crowd-pleaser,"Direction by Casey Nicholaw (""Aladdin,"" ""The Book of Mormon""), who's assembled an excellent cast, shines particularly bright. His staging packs style, invention and Red Bull-force energy that showcases the material to the max. Scenic design that makes smart use of video projections gives the show a seamless cinematic flow. Fey's book is faithful to the film and, naturally, preserves beloved lines - like ""fetch"" and ""On Wednesday we wear pink."" But she's added fresh jokes and updates for the social media age as 16-year-old Cady (an appealing Erika Henningsen) goes from Africa (there's a sly nod to ""The Lion King"") to a Chicago high school.",New York Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,04/08/2018
Mean Girls,8,Mean Girls,"Where Mean Girls glows most is in the spotlight it shines on its cast. Taylor Louderman is sensational as the blackhearted Regina, fearsome leader of the queen-beeyatch trio known as the Plastics. (Richmond gives her brassy, Bond-villain musical themes.) Flanking her are the manically insecure Gretchen (Ashley Park, her confusion infused with real feeling) and the chipper, empty-headed Karen (an extremely funny Kate Rockwell, with a tottering walk and a face like a blank check); on the opposite side of the cafeteria battlefield are the gothy ""art freak"" Janis (Barrett Wilbert Weed, a rich presence and powerhouse vocalist) and the brightly flaming Damian (Grey Henson, whose second-act tap number, ""Stop,"" does exactly that to the show). Mean Girls's gospel of female self-actualization is borne out in the platform it provides for some of the most exciting young performers in musical theater. They bring a lot to the cafeteria table.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,04/08/2018
Mean Girls,8,Theater Review: 'Mean Girls',"Fey's book is very funny and warm. She totally gets the teen culture and all the superficial drama that defines the high-school years. And if the score, by her husband Jeff Richmond with lyricist Nell Benjamin, lacks a big memorable number, the tuneful songs enhance the material quite nicely. Nicholaw, who also choreographed, paces the two-and-a-half hour production with high energy, maneuvering between the silly and serious moments with tremendous finesse. The clever video design with non-stop projections is a huge plus as well.",NY1,Roma Torre,04/08/2018
Mean Girls,8,"Mean Girls is not a regular musical, it's a cool musical: EW review","In setting this ""cautionary tale"" to music, Fey and lyricist Nell Benjamin (Legally Blonde) have more latitude to explore the internal lives of these now-iconic characters. Though Henningsen's Cady is more broadly naive than the one originated by Lindsay Lohan, her earnest vocals bring a quality of sweetness to numbers like ""Stupid In Love"" - in which Cady professes her equal devotion to math and her new crush Aaron Samuels (Kyle Selig). Henningsen finds her character's edge by her fifth number, ""Apex Predator"" - a rocking tribute to Regina's top-of-the-food-chain status, and the reveal of Cady's primal desire to be popular. ""What's Wrong With Me?"" shows poor Gretchen Wieners - played with a perfect mix of comic anxiety and melancholy by Ashley Park - in a rare moment of reflection: ""Where is my mind?

Directed and choreographed by The Book of Mormon's Casey Nicholaw (and produced by, among others, Lorne Michaels, who surveyed this preview performance with the same inscrutable, puckered expression caught occasionally by the cameras of Saturday Night Live) Mean Girls, at the August Wilson Theatre, stays true to the plot (and well-remembered jokes and catchphrases) of the film while smoothly updating the high school mischief-making for the age of social media.",Deadline,Greg Evans,04/08/2018

Mean Girls,7,Review: ‘Mean Girls’ Sets the Perils of Being Popular to Song,"That this ""Mean Girls"" takes place (still at an Illinois high school) 14 years later than the film has proved no obstacle to Ms. Fey. After all, social media only increases opportunities for social climbing and subversion. The disconnect that troubles this musical isn't a matter of adapting to changing times. Scott Pask's set, Gregg Barnes's costumes and Finn Ross and Adam Young's video designs render sociological exactitude with flat comic-strip brightness. No, the trouble lies in the less assured translation of Ms. Fey's sly take on adolescent social angst into crowd-pleasing song and dance. Mr. Richmond and Ms. Benjamin's many (many) musical numbers are passable by middle-of-the-road Broadway standards (though Ms. Benjamin's shoehorned rhymes do not bear close examination).",New York Times,Ben Brantley,04/08/2018

That's also because fresh-faced Henningsen, with her big, bright voice, brings such assurance to Cady's ricochets from guileless adventurer in a strange land to cool conqueror and back to humbled do-gooder, who is able to see the redeeming qualities in everyone. And Henningsen's sweet chemistry with Selig lends spark to their scenes; Aaron's own reawakening from Regina's spell contributes to Cady's growth as he tears down her misguided belief that ""More is Better.""",The Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/08/2018

The angst, joy and fear on display are big in a very hormonal teenager kind of way. ""Mean Girls,"" unlike its first cousin ""Legally Blonde,"" finds the necessary volume to justify breaking into song, whether those songs are about the despair of being an outsider or falling in love with a photo of the Wham!-era George Michael. These are the early traumatic experiences of life that stick in your memory much longer than passing the bar exam or applying for social security. If only Fey's springboard of a book had inspired more memorable, distinctive songs. A few hit the mark: ""I See Stars"" delivers chewable bubblegum and ""What's Wrong With Me?"" is a poignant lament from Gretchen, the most insecure of the Plastics.

As if trying to compensate, the production (staged by Casey Nicholaw, ""The Book of Mormon"") pulsates with high energy and hyperkinetic movement, as seen in everything from the broad-style performances to the shifting digital projections and all-out dance choreography.",amNY,Matt Windman,04/08/2018

Then again, the design here is more obvious: Abe (Gyllenhaal) scrambles stories about the death of his father and the birth of his daughter. Unlike Sturridge, Gyllenhaal segues seamlessly, and sometimes he's talking about Dad before we realize he's finished with the wife and baby. It's an effectively sentimental play, and Payne isn't above throwing in John Lennon's ""Imagine"" to give the heartstrings a good workout. It's also a deeply naive play.

On the other hand, Gyllenhaal gets to have more fun and be far more energetic, at various points even running through the audience and playing bits of John Lennon's ""Imagine"" on a piano. The lean production (directed by Carrie Cracknell, who has extensive London credits) hearkens back to the most basic elements of narrative storytelling and sharing of life experiences.

All of that stands, but seeing it again, this time in the larger Broadway venue, I noticed the many moments of humor that Gyllenhaal and Sturridge pull off so efficiently. Gyllenhaal, in particular, seems to have loosened up a bit in his role, superbly providing quicksilver shifts in tone and mood.

The Height of the Storm,8,'The Height of the Storm': Theater Review,"The merciless forces of dementia, anxiety and depression, respectively, torment the protagonists of Florian Zeller's family trilogy, The Father, The Mother and The Son, intricate dramatic puzzles in which the French playwright deftly drops the audience inside the confusion of his characters' heads. All those states of psychological distress exert their cruel influence in The Height of the Storm. If the author's bag of tricks is becoming familiar and the wispy drama is too fragmented to be fully satisfying, the commanding performances of Jonathan Pryce and Eileen Atkins and the meticulous direction of Jonathan Kent nonetheless make this an affecting elegy.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,09/24/2019

What's to become of Dad and/or Mom? How can we salvage Dad's valuable unpublished work? Who's going to take all these books? These are some of the questions pondered by the couple's two grown children, loving Anne (Amanda Drew) and self-centered Elise (Lisa O'Hare). They are, of course, the eternal questions whenever a parent dies, and these two siblings are no better equipped to deal with them than any of the rest of us.

But this gauziness of tone also keeps the play from feeling intellectually or emotionally filling.

Simply said, Julie Taymor's staging of Disney's ""The Lion King"" is a marvel, a theatrical achievement unrivaled in its beauty, brains and ingenuity. Leaping far beyond its celluloid inspiration, the stage version improves upon nearly every aspect of the hit 1994 animated film, from visual artistry and storytelling to Lebo M's score and the newly African-ized pop songs of Elton John and Tim Rice. With this production, the Walt Disney Co. stages itself as a serious and ambitious contender on the legit scene, all but demanding that its first theatrical foray, 1994's too-literally adapted ""Beauty and the Beast,"" was little more than a warm-up.",Variety,Greg Evans,11/14/1997

The Lion King,8,Cub Comes of Age: A Twice-Told Cosmic Tale,"Where are you, really, anyway? The location is supposed to be a theater on 42d Street, a thoroughfare that has never been thought of as a gateway to Eden. Yet somehow you have fallen into what appears to be a primal paradise. And even the exquisitely restored New Amsterdam Theater, a former Ziegfeld palace, disappears before the spectacle within it. Such is the transporting magic wrought by the opening 10 minutes of 'The Lion King.' Unfortunately, it turns out that these glorious opening moments are only the honeymoon part of this fable of the coming of age of a lion with a father fixation. Throughout the show's 2 hours and 40 minutes (as against the 75-minute movie), there will be plenty of instances of breathtaking beauty and scenic ingenuity, realized through techniques ranging from shadow puppetry to Bunraku. Certainly, nowhere before on Broadway has a stampede of wildebeests or a herd of veldt-skimming gazelles been rendered with such eye-popping conviction. But in many ways, Ms. Taymor's vision, which is largely rooted in ritual forms of theater from Asia and Africa, collides with that of Disney, where visual spectacle is harnessed in the service of heartwarming storytelling. There will inevitably be longueurs for both adults and children who attend this show. But it offers a refreshing and more sophisticated alternative to the standard panoply of special effects that dominate most tourist-oriented shows today. Seen purely as a visual tapestry, there is simply nothing else like it.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,11/14/1997

The Phantom of the Opera,9,A grand 'Opera',"It is a spectacular entertainment, visually the most impressive of the British musicals. Perhaps the most old-fashioned thing about it is it's a love story, something Broadway has not seen for quite a while. To say the score is Lloyd Webber's best is not saying a great deal. His music always has a synthetic, borrowed quality to it. As you listen you find yourself wondering where you've heard it before. In this case you've heard a lot of it in Puccini, in the work of other Broadway composers and even the Beatles. Nevertheless he seems to be borrowing from better sources, and he has much greater sophistication about putting it all together. There are some droll opera parodies, several beautiful songs, an impressive septet and a grand choral number, all richly orchestrated.",New York Daily News,Howard Kissel,01/27/1988

It's good for a Broadway run of several years. Andrew Lloyd Webber has taken the Gaston Leroux potboiler about the love-crazed disfigured genius who lives in the catacombs of the Paris Opera and fashioned it into a thrilling and musically rich mass legit entertainment. The 19th century period spectacle, scenic legerdemain, soaring melodies and exceptional singing are at the service of an involving and piquantly offbeat love story, all of it staged with brilliantly organized flair by Harold Prince, back in top form.",Variety,Richard Hummler,01/27/1988

It would be equally ludicrous, however - and an invitation to severe disappointment - to let the hype kindle the hope that 'Phantom' is a credible heir to the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals that haunt both Andrew Lloyd Webber's creative aspirations and the Majestic Theater as persistently as the evening's title character does. What one finds instead is a characteristic Lloyd Webber project - long on pop professionalism and melody, impoverished of artistic personality and passion - that the director Harold Prince, the designer Maria Bjornson and the mesmerizing actor Michael Crawford have elevated quite literally to the roof.

But do we really want to dedicate our time to his lengthy, self-centered learning process - especially, in Tootsie, when the hero gets to spend so much of that process enjoying the spotlight? Despite its razzle-dazzle, Tootsie feels empty at the center.

Which wouldn't matter if the results were subpar; but they are above-par, considerably so. The key statement is not that Waitress is a musical from a team of women, but that Waitress is a good musical from a creative team who happen to be women.

Waitress,8,Review: Jessie Mueller Serves a Slice of Life (With Pie) in Sara Bareilles’s ‘Waitress’,"Ms. Mueller, who won a Tony for her performance in ""Beautiful: The Carole King Musical,"" possesses a rich, soulful and emotionally translucent voice, and an ability to bring heaping cupfuls of subtext to her acting. But as with the unremarkable jukebox musical that brought her Broadway stardom, Ms. Mueller's talent often outstrips the material she's given here. So, incidentally, do the gifts of her supporting cast, who provide brightly colored, vibrantly sung performances....Much of the score, by the pop singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles, is appealing, drawing on the sounds of country music reflecting the Southern setting, but also containing more traditional Broadway-pop balladry. But the book by Jessie Nelson, based on the movie written and directed by (and co-starring) Adrienne Shelly, tends to flatten most of the characters into comic cartoons. (To be fair, they do not have much more depth in the movie, from which some of the musical's dialogue is borrowed.)",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,04/24/2016

Waitress,8,Waitress,"Based on the 2007 indie film by the late writer-director Adrienne Shelly, Waitress has been whipped (I'll stop now) into an expertly constructed and emotionally satisfying tale of self-liberation in the face of limited options. Jessie Nelson's broadly comic yet brooding book meshes wonderfully with a frisky, bright score by pop star Sara Bareilles, a seasoned songwriter who lets the Beatles and other Britpop influences shine through. Bareilles's custom-built earworms address workplace pluck (""Opening Up""), first-date jitters (""When He Sees Me""), quirky, obsessive love (""Never Ever Getting Rid of Me"") and an eleventh-hour ballad of loss and regret (""She Used to Be Mine""), which will rip your heart out.",TimeOut NY,David Cote,04/24/2016
Waitress,8,'Waitress' is an intimate Broadway musical of the highest order,"Mueller's is a performance stripped of condescension, lived in the moment and rich in musical pleasures; surely there is no singing actress of Mueller's generation better able to play a woman of low power and self-esteem....In this show she immediately moves her lips whenever Jenna is asked a question - signaling to the audience that Jenna's main problem is that she worries so much about pleasing others that she never has learned how to put her own needs first. Jenna eventually grabs such an opportunity with her comely-but-married gynecologist (played by Drew Gehling), and it is here that the show stutters: Gehling's Dr. Pomatter feels like a sitcom doc rather than a serious love interest for a serious young woman, and thus you don't pull for them as you should. I had the same issue with Nick Cordero's Earl (Jenna's husband), played as a standard-issue man-spreader when the show would be better if you saw deeper into his anger and depression - especially since Bareilles has given him ""You Will Still Be Mine,"" one of the most poignant songs in the show.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/24/2016

But the material is anchored at every step by Bareilles' melodious pop score and Mueller's supremely natural performance as Jenna. While the stock characters that surround her may be familiar, they're a winsome bunch played by sterling performers. As her fellow waitresses - feisty, sass-mouthed Becky and mousy, borderline-OCD Dawn - Keala Settle and Kimiko Glenn are treasures, the dynamic among the three of them revealing the material's debt to Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/24/2016

Jenna is a heroine of the moment, taking control of her life and offering no apologies for her choices, even - or especially - the arguable ones. Mueller has a girl-next-door appeal that sublimates into something less earthbound when she sings, her pleasingly throbby mezzo a purring engine in ballads until she lets out the reins and the horsepower kicks in.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,04/24/2016

Some other supporting parts fare far, far better, as with an eccentric suitor for Dawn named Ogie, played to the wonderfully kooky hilt by Christopher Fitzgerald. The number late in Act 1 in which Ogie introduces himself to us, ""Never Ever Getting Rid of Me,"" jump-starts the proceedings with its effervescent spirit (and suggests that it might be fun if Ogie and Dawn got a spinoff musical of their own).",Washington Post,Peter Marks,04/24/2016

As the story rushed toward its multiple conclusions - a typical Broadway problem the creative team was unable to solve - I began to understand that for these characters, life itself is an uncomfortable genre mix. Seeing that and sharing it is the start of their mastering it. Perhaps it really did take an all-female creative team to understand how such a story could be true, and how it could sing.

And so was her loving mother, who appears as a ghost, baking pies when she isn't being beaten up by her own thug of a husband....The result of all this marital and on-the-job abuse is that the men's behavior, past and present, overwhelms the show. The first act is well on its way to breaking out the razor blades when a very supporting character, played by Christopher Fitzgerald, lifts the show and proceeds to steal it....Fitzgerald is one of those great Broadway character actors who also has the acting chops and charisma to carry a show, but rarely gets the opportunity.

Waitress,6,Waitress review – pie-focused musical seems half-baked,"Under Diane Paulus' direction, the show at times seems to struggle to fill the stage. The book, written by Jessie Nelson and based on the film script, is nicely witty. But the choreography, by Lorin Latarro, seems an afterthought, and the songs, by the Grammy-winning artist Sara Bareilles, are tuneful, yet often strangely reticent, as though meant to be sung quietly to oneself rather than loudly before a crowd. Bad Idea, a duet between Jenna and Dr Pomatter, is a nicely rowdy exception, as is Jenna's heartfelt She Used to Be Mine. (One song for Ogie, Never Getting Rid of Me, is a showstopper; the other, I Love You Like a Table, a cheerful muddle.)",Guardian,Alexis Soloski,04/24/2016
Waitress,6,Jessie Mueller's star turn is baked to perfection in 'Waitress',"Director Diane Paulus (""Pippin"") does a fine job guiding actors to lively performances. But her staging is heavy-handed. The pie metaphor is unobtrusive on film, but it's force-fed on stage. Musicals, like dough, get stiff when overworked.

But it's safe to say that this is the most complete, and completely satisfying, new musical I've come across in a long time. The triumph is not Schwartz's alone. Adapted from a Gregory Maguire novel, Wicked offers a post-feminist, socially conscious reinterpretation of the story of Oz's Wicked Witch of the West.

Wicked,5,There's Trouble in Emerald City,"As a parable of fascism and freedom, ""Wicked"" so overplays its hand that it seriously dilutes its power to disturb. Much of the impact of Baum's original novel, like that of so many fantasy stories, came from haunting, symbolic figures that readers interpret on their own terms. Though there have been numerous literary analyses of Baum's ""Oz"" as a coded case for populism and agrarian reform, the book never feels like a tract. ""Wicked,"" on the other hand, wears its political heart as if it were a slogan button. This is true not only of the dialogue, but also of Mr. Schwartz's generically impassioned songs, which have that to-the-barricades sound of the omninously underscored anthems of ""Les Misérables."" Though the talk is festooned with cutely mangled word (""swankified,"" ""thrillified,"" ""gratitution"") that bring to mind the language of Smurfs, there's a rock-hard lecture beneath the preciousness.

Wicked,4,Wicked,"Described as a dense epic fantasy, 'Wicked,"" based on a novel, is an intricate work. It tells the story of Elphaba, the bright but neglected young girl born with green skin who is good and kind. How she turns into the wicked witch is a long, winding road filled with bizarre characters and strange plot twists. The problem with the show's book, by Winnie Holzman, is that it has to cover so much ground in a connect-the-dots fashion that we're deprived of the necessary depth and character development to make us really care about Elphaba or her unlikely friend Galinda, who later becomes Glinda the good witch. Director Joe Mantello handles the intimate scenes well, but he's not quite as successful moving the traffic on Eugene Lee's dark, mechanical set. The ensemble numbers are indistinguishable. The special effects were impressive but a show of this caliber needed more.

Laura Osnes brings a crystalline grace to the role of debutante Hope Harcourt, pressured by her status-conscious mother (hooray for Jessica Walter) to marry into class - and money. Mama's quarry, the audience knows, is Lord Oakleigh, a prime specimen of an upper-class twit, all foppish, repressed postures. What the audience doesn't know is that British theater regular Adam Godley will, by the time he busts loose with Foster in 'The Gypsy in Me,' steal his crucial bit of the show and utterly delight the cheering house with his brilliant comic timing.",Entertainment Weekly,Lisa Schwarzbaum,04/07/2011

In many ways, ""Burn This"" is Anna's play, but any actress would find it hard to compete against the monologues-as-arias that Wilson gives Pale. There are no such showcase moments for Anna, though Russell can be a spellbinder, too, as she tells the story of being in a room filled with pinned butterflies. The metaphor suits Anna all too well. Russell, whose stage credits are slim but who's proven her chops onscreen in ""The Americans,"" creates a vivid, if less flashy, performance.

And Russell? She's just plain beautiful in a star turn filled with the rich, emotional honesty that made her irresistible in TV's ""Felicity."" Her toned legs and exquisite arches make her look like the dancer she plays.

At one point, he gently puts his hand on Russell's breastbone, and it's genuinely unsettling how much of her tiny torso his big human paw covers. He's an unstoppable force and an immovable object. And he's funny as heck. Whether he's steaming over the injustices of the world - ""Half my fuckin' adult life, I swear to Christ, has been spent looking for a place to park!"" - or padding around the room wearing one of Anna's little happi coats, struggling to get his enormous limbs through the weird double armholes, Driver's got a keen sense for comedy of multiple sizes, from the subtle background lazzo to the over-the-top tirade. It's fun to watch him interact with Uranowitz's wonderfully wry Larry - who can't help smiling, as if from behind his hand, at such a splattery, honest display of personality - and with Furr's Burton, who's sympathetic despite his many blind spots, and who really doesn't mean to bust out his aikido training on Pale.

The Scottish Cumming is joined by two of today's finest American stage actors, Linda Emond and Danny Burstein, who lend fresh insights...The real revelation of this Cabaret, though, is its leading lady, the film star Michelle Williams...Williams brings to the role a pained fragility that feels distinctive, and makes Sally's determination to not face either her past or the world crumbling around her especially poignant...It's a star turn that, even in this rich season, is truly unmissable -- as is this Cabaret in general.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,04/24/2014

Waifish and vocally tremulous, Michelle Williams is credibly lost as Sally Bowles, a wanna-be bad girl who sings at the club; Bill Heck is appealing as her unlikely lover, Cliff, a sexually ambiguous writer.

Natasha Richardson had those qualities in spades. Granted, this is not an easy role, but Michelle Williams, whether miscast or just not up to the challenge, is missing some vital ingredients. Sally talks of allure, but Williams' Sally is largely lacking in that department. And because of this, the entire show is thrown off. Suddenly, the people we care most about are Fraulein Schneider and Herr Schultz.

I'm assuming that's more a matter of character interpretation than of personal discomfort, but it does put sort of a damper on the festivities...Leading the Kit Kat girls in nightclub production numbers like ""Don't Tell Mama"" and ""Mein Herr"" with a shiny, metallic vibrato, Ms. Williams comes closer to evoking the musical style of the Depression than any Sally I've seen.

In other words, Cumming is better than ever -- wiser, more dissipated, even more deeply entertaining in the role he stunningly recreated from Joel Grey's iconic original. And that freshness is so infectious it spills over into a landmark production that closed in 2004 but feels, with one uneasy exception, as confident -- and about as dangerous -- as if it has been running ever since.

Would you be as outraged by Spears' sexy schoolgirl look having seen Miley Cyrus swing around naked on a wrecking ball? Just because this ""Cabaret"" doesn't carry the same shock value as it once did doesn't mean we should strip this production of its worth...Cumming's Emcee is mischievous and funny as ever. But age has allowed Cumming to mature his character in ways we haven't seen before. His Emcee is more in command now, and when he peers in on the action from the shallows, it feels less observant and more foreboding. Like he knows the inevitability of what's ahead...And then there's Michelle Williams' stunning and heartbreaking portrayal of nightclub singer Sally Bowles...It took me a bit to notice the nuance and layers the three-time Oscar nominee has built into Sally...Williams' voice is lush, for example, but she adds shaky moments to show us that Sally's internal insecurities.

Alan Cumming won a Tony for the role 16 years ago. Beaming with creepy charisma, the sly Cumming is better than ever conjuring an androgynous bottom feeder whose smile hides something much darker and grimmer... a platinum-blond Williams assumes an English accent and an almost jolly and girlish demeanor flecked with desperation. She comes off so feathery that Sally could fly away -- except for her full-tilt go at the title song. Besides that final scene, Williams comes off paler and wispier than desired.

Despite several returns to the Emcee, Grey always remained a nasty little imp. Cumming, on the other hand, is now giving a self-referential performance that softens the character considerably.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,04/24/2014
Cabaret,8,Theater Review: Michelle Williams and Alan Cumming Come (Back) to the Cabaret,"I'm not sure you could call Cumming, with his rouged nipples and S&M undergear, tame; certainly he's tireless. But as the only holdover cast member, he's also the only one with a need to articulate a deeper understanding of his character. I'm not sure this can be done with a character who is a concept; at any rate, Cumming over-articulates the Emcee, illustrating every word he speaks like a mime instructor. Some of the punch lines get killed by the huge pauses he takes to set them up...The performers who make the most of their material are in fact the two who have the least background in musicals. Michelle Williams's head voice is breathy, with a hummingbird vibrato; her belt is solid if somewhat coarse. But these are not handicaps with Sally, and in any case she acts the hell out of the role...Not even Richardson, superb as she was, brought quite this sense of brimming irrepressibility to the role: irrepressible eagerness and irrepressible sorrow. And, somehow, both together.",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/24/2014
Cabaret,8,Cabaret review – Alan Cumming is saucy and menacing in a sly revival,"The 1998 production was staged in the same venue, Studio 54, and starred Jennifer Jason Leigh as Sally Bowles, which she played with spiky, unpredictable abandon. Michelle Williams is a very different kind of actor, in this instance gauche, touching, unsure of herself in a way that seems as true to the idea of Sally Bowles as more robust approaches...As was the case the first time round, the show is Alan Cumming's and his MC has to be one of the great stage performances of all time. It's so rare to get a second shot at seeing something this good, you should do anything you can to get a ticket. Where Joel Grey, in the movie version, was impish and sinister, Cumming is brutish, jack-booted, playing the part with a yobbish licentiousness that highlights just how close the satirist and the satirised come to looking to each other in the end. It's a hard thing to be saucy and menacing at the same time, but Cumming pulls it off.",Guardian,Emma Brockes,04/24/2014
Cabaret,8,"Michelle Williams in Cabaret, review: 'heart-stopping'","Michelle Williams, an enormously gifted screen actress, is making her Broadway debut with this role. Doll-like in her blonde bob, she's more girlish than fatale, playing it with an unsteady, skittish desperation and a plummy, naughty accent that seems directly modelled on Renee Zellwegger's Bridget Jones. No bad thing, but occasionally it slips and falters and, like the accent, the spoken parts of her performance sometimes feel wobbly. She becomes more and more compelling, however, as the show goes on, singing and dancing with a furious, madcap quality and by the time she delivers the title number she's at the height of her power...Alan Cumming, made up like an Otto Dix painting, is perfect as the delicious and depraved Master of Ceremonies and he sets the tone for a show that's as riotously risqué as it is ultimately ruthless.",Telegraph,Hermione Hoby,04/24/2014
Cabaret,8,Once again in hands of Alan Cumming's Emcee in 'Cabaret',"It is hard to think of a single revival of any musical that has achieved such fusion with the popular perception of the material. That makes this remounting, or reviving, or whatever the Tony Awards committee is calling it, perfectly justifiable in my book. Mendes' ""Cabaret"" was, and is, a brilliantly inventive and revealing conception. Then and now...Cumming now oozes relaxed confidence in his charms, whereas he formerly spilled unctuous ambition. Both work, frankly. Cumming does not kill himself anymore, but there is no demonstrable need. He is, really, the consummate Emcee -- others who take on hosting duties at the Kit Kat Klub invariably copy him -- and his relationship with his delighted audience now arrives with ease...Williams, who makes her Broadway debut as Sally, certainly taps into the fragility of her character...She does not, however, deliver the famous numbers with the force (or tonal quality) of a great Broadway singer, which she is not.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/24/2014
Cabaret,7,NY Review: CABARET,"Scholars tell us that the ancient Greek masks of Comedy and Tragedy were often hung on the same hook. The face underneath those masks might have been Alan Cumming's. His dazzling Emcee is at first comic, leading us on a louche pansexual romp through the decadence of Berlin during the Weimar years. Then his performance grows darker and darker, as the show does, as despair and terror creep in as the Nazis gain power. Cumming is so irresistible that nobody else onstage stands much of a chance...Michelle Williams, lovely as she is, is the weak link in this big strong cast. She seems neither desperate nor outrageous nor self-mocking, as Sally Bowles needs to be, and even in her huge rendition of the show's title song, she seems to be trying too hard, too rehearsed, too controlled, too humorless.",Philadelpia Inquirer,Toby Zinman,04/24/2014
Cabaret,7,It's the Great Sequined Way,"I don't share in the general enthusiasm for Mr. Cumming's overcooked performance, which pales in intensity when compared to the diamond-hard detachment that Joel Grey, who created the role in the original stage production, brought to Bob Fosse's extraordinary 1972 film version, from which Messrs. Mendes and Marshall borrowed a thing or three. But Michelle Williams plays Sally Bowles, the shopworn diva of the Kit Kat Club, with a poignant blend of vulnerability and desperation, while Linda Emond and Danny Burstein are as good as it gets as Fräulein Schneider and Herr Schultz, the couple whose middle-age romance serves as a backdrop to Sally's doomed affair with the bisexual Clifford Bradshaw (played with just the right amount of small-town naiveté by Bill Heck). While I like ""Cabaret"" better when it's done on a smaller scale with shabbier décor, the way that Rhode Island's Trinity Repertory Company did it in 2009, this staging is fabulously good in its fancier way.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,04/24/2014
Cabaret,7,Carbon Copy 'Cabaret',"Anyone who is unfamiliar with ""Cabaret,"" or even just this version of it, should definitely check it out. But as for everyone else, it's really just more of the same. Even a new production that proved to be less innovative would have been more exciting than this rehash. As the Emcee, Alan Cumming retains the sleazy presence that made his performance so entrancing originally. On the other hand, Michelle Williams makes a shaky Broadway debut, coming off as too fragile to portray the sexually aggressive singer Sally Bowles.",amNY,Matt Windman,04/24/2014
Cabaret,6,First Nighter: Sam Mendes's Revived 'Cabaret' Runs on Dimmed Lights,"Let me quickly specify that Cumming, repeating the role that brought him a Tony 16 years ago, is every juicy leer as good now as he was then in his role of the deliciously decadent compere at the Third Reich's Kit Kat Klub in Berlin...Time now unfortunately, for the problems besetting this Cabaret incarnation. The major one is the accomplished movie star Michelle Williams in her Main Stem bow as Sally Bowles...The singing's not the snag. Just about everything else, starting with her English accent, is...The high point and low point of her performance are the same: her rendition of the title song. Technically, she delivers it extremely well and for her efforts receives sustained applause. As an expression of Sally Bowles's state of mind, the way librettist Joe Masteroff and Ebb write, Williams has it all wrong--and so have director Mendes, Marshall and Onrubia, if they're allowing this misconstrued treatment.",Huffington Post,David Finkle,04/24/2014

Schreiber, for his part, isn't reptilian or overly lascivious. His Valmont is idly amused and relaxed - even drunkenly indifferent - until he pounces like a shark, a true seduction machine.

The ferocious Janet McTeer has come over, too, as the scheming Marquise de Merteuil, more than a match for Valmont as they trade the hearts of naive men and women like playing cards. Schreiber's impassive libertine pairs nicely with McTeer's vengeful, wicked widow. Director Josie Rourke opts for a languid pace as these two dance a minuet of wasted love and cruelty, a game in which death is the prize and the winner feels cheated.",TimeOut NY,David Cote,10/30/2016

He is not a preener and, at first, that wig with Vulcan hairline hardly eases him into the elegance of Christopher Hampton's deliciously evil and erotic 1985 adaptation of Choderlos de Laclos' scandalous novel. And yet Schreiber finds another way, an increasingly irresistible way, into a character generally expected to exemplify the exquisite, unrepentant boredom of the pre-Revolution French aristocracy. This Valmont seems more drawn to the mischief of the games he plots with the Marquise that ruin innocent people for sport and revenge. Despite his height and despite the violent moments when rough seductions get cringingly close to what we perceive today as rape, his Valmont is a bit of an imp - bemused, playful, almost touching in his insolent confidence.",Newsday,Linda Winer,10/30/2016

Les Liaisons Dangereuses,6,Liev Schreiber Dons Wig And Accent In ‘Les Liaisons Dangereuses’ Broadway Revival – Review,"So Rourke's production seems so much gilding of the lily, as it were, making the points with as heavy a hand as possible. It's skillfully performed, sometimes visually arresting but mostly just plain crude. This is especially so in the performances Rourke draws from her stars. McTeer, who is tall and regal, seems to pause before each over-emphasized curl of the lip, arch of the eyebrow, pointing of the finger, in a performance that unfolds as if in stop-action until her penultimate scene, when Merteuil explodes in jealous rage at Valmont. Schreiber, who exudes plenty of sexual charisma in other settings, here takes some getting used to in wig, breeches and ruling class accent. Neither the bon mot nor the catty snipe roll trippingly off his tongue, and his protestations of life-changing ardor for Tourvel are cringe-inducingly unconvincing. He's much more believable when he's got one hand over young Cécile's mouth while shoving the other up her sleeping gown.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,10/30/2016

He's less a bodice-ripping villain than the kind of guy who in modern times would be hanging around school playgrounds wearing a trench coat. Schreiber generates little in the way of chemistry with McTeer, and even less with the actresses who play his two conquests, Birgitte Hjort Sørensen (HBO's ""Vinyl""), as the virtuous Madame de Tourvel, and Elena Kampouris (""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2""), as the virginal Cecile.

Les Liaisons Dangereuses,6,Reviews: Les Liaisons Dangereuses and The Harvest,"Classically trained actors are naturally drawn to roles that show off their verbal fluency, but few contemporary plays give them the chance. No wonder Christopher Hampton's Les Liaisons Dangereuses, with its baroque dialogue bordering on camp, has proved so popular with upmarket stars. Lindsay Duncan and Alan Rickman headed the 1985 premiere; Glenn Close and John Malkovich the 1988 film; now Janet McTeer and Liev Schreiber lead the gorgeous but tiresome revival that opens tonight on Broadway. The script is full of lines like ""I wonder if I'm beginning to guess what it is you're intending to propose,"" which despite the heavy ironing required to make them lie flat reward the effort with only a vestigial feeling that something humorous has happened. Indeed, Les Liaisons is a trap: In portraying the moral decadence of the Ancien Régime, it aligns itself with that decadence.

Les Liaisons Dangereuses,6,Les Liaisons Dangereuses review – Janet McTeer brings fire and ice to Broadway,"This production has no doubt that Merteuil will win, though at some cost to herself, and Schreiber seems to sense this. There's a saturnine, slightly defeated air to his alcoholic Valmont. Despite Schreiber's height, swagger and masculine force, his Valmont is no match for Merteuil. He layers some of his eventual rout into the earlier scenes, all but ceding the stage to McTeer. McTeer knows what to do with it. She has set her voice somewhere between purr and growl and arranged her hands and arms into movements that are both perfect expressions of court gestures and precise parodies of them. Her Merteuil is both elegant and vicious, with an air of surface refinement barely concealing the ferocity below. There are claws beneath her manicure, fangs behind her smile. Her extraordinary performance is scorching and chilling. Ice and fire at once.",The Guardian,Alexis Soloski,10/30/2016

There is a listlessness to this performance - which is problematic since the basic equipment required of even the lowest tier of Casanova is great enthusiasm for the task at hand. Schreiber seems to want to expend the minimum amount of energy, nothing really beyond his probing hand and fingers, which works against the operating procedure of a smooth-tongued seducer whose flattering charm is his principal weapon.

Of course, the point of the play is that unpleasant things are going to go down in this Norman Rockwell-esque backyard, but there are also unpleasant things going on in the fabric of Miller's play, and these are being summarily avoided-even added to-as the production reverentially, almost complacently, presents All My Sons as an unquestioned masterpiece.",Vulture,Sara Holdren,04/22/2019

Love Letters,8,The Muted Melancholy Between the Lines,"I had a suspicion that Mr. Gurney's play, first seen in New York in 1989 and trotted out regularly since then at regional and amateur theaters the world over, might by now feel as dated as the means by which its characters trade their thoughts. I also thought I detected a little cynicism in bringing what is essentially a staged reading to Broadway, sprucing it up with big names, and charging roughly $140 for a top-price ticket. But before long, my qualms began to erode under the sweet, sad spell of Mr. Gurney's deceptively simple and quietly moving play. As performed by a sterling Mr. Dennehy, playing the rock-solid, letter-loving Andrew Makepeace Ladd III, and an utterly extraordinary Ms. Farrow, as the flighty, unstable and writing-averse Melissa Gardner, Mr. Gurney's intimate drama gains steadily in power, as life keeps ripping away at the seams of its characters' well-tailored existences. The play's means may be economical, but it etches a deep portrait of life's painful vicissitudes.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,09/18/2014

Gurney's deceptively simple 1988 epistolary two-hander, Love Letters, is that rare work whose emotional richness requires no embellishment in order to become a full-bodied theatrical experience. All that's needed are gifted actors capable of tracing the poignant thread of longing and regret that binds half a century of correspondence between characters whose relationship is thwarted by hesitation. And as the first couple in this production's all-star rotating cast, Brian Dennehy and Mia Farrow deliver with impeccable restraint.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,09/18/2014

Both seasoned actors slide easily into their carefully shaded roles: She affects a pixieish impudence as free-thinking rich girl Melissa Gardner; he maintains a stiff sense of propriety as rules-bound Andrew Makepeace Ladd III...As usual with Gurney, the language is wry, witty and balanced by reflexive sadness, a mixed admiration and horror for Eastern WASP repression and snobbery.

Farrow, still luminous at 69, can be devastatingly coquettish and hilariously self-important as Melissa the girl...but is just as committed to capturing the aging woman's increasing desperation. For Dennehy...Love Letters would seem to present few challenges. But the actor invests the role with a robust, if laid-back energy that never lets us forget Andy's drive to do good, and be good, even when he comes across as conflicted or, occasionally, callous...Gurney's play, even in its mawkish moments, makes a compelling case for a ""dying art.""",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,09/18/2014

But what a range of emotions Farrow portrays as she simply sits reading behind the desk...As Melissa Gardner, Farrow somehow transforms from bright, petulant, rich girl to restless woman and disturbed loner with little more than a squint or a bray or a flick of her long, fuzzy, golden hair.

I felt the agony to my bones when Melissa realizes Andy has abandoned her...Dennehy, with his gruff mannerisms and scowl, is excellent in a role that is, in ways, the more complex. Andy proves partly responsible for Melissa's descent--yet the play can only stay on solid ground if Andy is ultimately likable. He pulls it off with authority.

And Farrow's matched note-for-note by Brian Dennehy...Stage vet Dennehy brings a steady sturdiness as Andy, narrowing his eyes and shifting in his seat to suggest regret and uncertainty under the calm surface.

The real surprise here is Farrow, returning to the Main Stem for the first time in 18 years...She's a real actress, and she uses her considerable tools and her wonderful voice to evoke Melissa's girlish naivete, her teenage petulance, and then her grown-up insecurity...Love Letters reminds us that class can not only us in our place, but thwart any effort to forge real connections outside of ourselves.

Love Letters,8,A Pair of Aces,"One reason why ""Love Letters"" is so frequently produced is that it's written in such a way as to facilitate both come-and-go celebrity casting and bargain-basement staging. Not only is there no set, but the actors sit together at a table and read from scripts instead of memorizing their lines. But the enduring success of ""Love Letters"" is far more than a mere matter of logistical convenience. It's one of Mr. Gurney's best plays, a tender study of thwarted love: Melissa is a scatty upper-class rebel, Andy is a stuffy upper-middle-class striver, and as they read a lifetime's worth of letters out loud, you come to know them so well that their parallel sorrows seem as familiar as your own.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,09/18/2014

Love Letters,7,Theater review: 'Love Letters',"The grip it maintains for much of its 90 minutes is partially due to Gurney's shrewd employment of tried-and-true dramatic elements. The passage of time - people going from youth to late middle age - is always poignant. And so is the notion of two individuals failing to recognize the true love they're meant to share. But the playwright also deserves credit for a crisp, amusing and actor-friendly script.

Granted, Melissa is more colorful - she goes through a greater variety of emotions, and has all the good lines.

Love Letters,6,Review: 'Love Letters' on Broadway with Brian Dennehy and Mia Farrow is a thin missive,"What's the minimum requirement for putting on a play? Is it performers? Sets? Memorization? Surely, at a minimum, it's acting, right? More than a quarter-century after ""Love Letters"" premiered, A.R. Gurney's charming ditty of a play has landed on Broadway with virtually none of the characteristics of what you might expect in a play. While the script is clever, the thinness of the spectacle -- which the author himself insisted upon -- is sadly deflating...You almost feel sorry for Dennehy and Farrow, who are both trapped in a twilight between full-on acting and reading. It's like putting a mighty Rolls-Royce engine into a Fiat 500...Dennehy is great as a young earnest lover and is wonderful years later as a respected man torn in several directions emotionally.

Melissa and Andrew's childhood exchanges are as cute as they are dull...She's born rich, he services the rich. So what's their problem? Unlike Farrow, Dennehy doesn't affect a kid-like sing song voice for his early readings. But this actor could read the phone book and be engaging. Instead, he's performing ""Love Letters,"" so we don't have a choice. Farrow has the far juicier part...Farrow gets to show evidence of alcoholism, substance abuse, artistic failure, and the pressures of being the Other Woman to a well-known politician.

Love Letters,5,Theater Review: How Much Can Mia Farrow and Brian Dennehy Get Out of Love Letters?,"Gurney has an overfondness for structural tricks; another is currently on view in The Wayside Motor Inn at the Signature. But in Love Letters, at least, the artificial restriction brought out something compensatory in him, especially when the letters are allowed to escape their strict my-turn-your-turn alternation. Most moving are the holes, the lacunae left by one character's refusal, in a snit or in trouble, to reply, or to accept the feeble cajolery of the other, sometimes for years. The result, tellingly, is a spongiform record of a relationship. Are not all relationships as much empty space as connective tissue? But the pitfalls of the play's structure are just as evident, and Gurney steps right into them. How, for instance, do you end such a correspondence? Gurney does it, unfortunately, with an explicitly heart-tugging coda that breaks the frame - too little, too late. In a play (or even just an event) clearly meant to be a love letter to writing letters, he settles for a most uncomplimentary close.",Vulture,Jesse Green,09/18/2014

Born Yesterday,7,Born Yesterday,"There are very few shows in which the set earns more applause than its top-billed TV stars, but the breezy Broadway revival of the 1946 comedy Born Yesterday is one of them. John Lee Beatty has designed a radiant art deco gem of a hotel suite with gilded fixtures, glimmering onyx woodwork, ruby-red upholstery, and satiny sapphire walls. Topped off by fat swirls of curlicue chalk-white molding, it is - just as playwright Garson Kanin dictated in his stage directions - 'a masterpiece of offensive good taste.' No wonder it trumps Robert Sean Leonard's entrance. And, a few minutes later, Jim Belushi's entrance. But after Nina Arianda slinks her way down the center staircase, curtsies clumsily, and storms back up the steps, the set doesn't seem quite as glossy. As bubble-headed bottle blonde Billie Dawn - a role that won Judy Holliday an Oscar in 1950 - Arianda is giving a performance that could be called breakout, though breakout somehow seems insufficient.",Entertainment Weekly,Melissa Rose Bernardo,04/27/2011

The celluloid shadow of the wondrous Judy Holliday, who played Billie in the original 1946 Broadway production and the movie directed by George Cukor, inevitably looms large over any revival of ""Born Yesterday."" (Madeline Kahn starred in the only previous Broadway revival, in 1989.)

In director Bartlett Sher's thoughtful but uneven revival of the enduring, endearing musical ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" Danny Burstein - a longtime Broadway veteran stepping at last into a starring role as comfortably as a favorite slipper - brings charm, decency and depth of feeling to the role of a Jewish dairyman living in a shtetl in pre-Revolution Russia with his wife, Golde, and their five daughters. Some may take exception to some of Sher's tinkering with the template of the beloved title, but few will find fault in Burstein's gentle, lovable man of faith, family and community. What's not to like? The personal intimacy of Tevye's casual conversations with God, not to mention the easy rapport Burstein has with the audience, only intensifies the humor and humanity of the classic material, and should prove an attractive draw for both first-timers and returning fans of the show.",Variety,Frank Rizzo,12/20/2015

Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,8,On Broadway: ‘Cat’ lands on its feet,"At least in the new ""Cat,"" the sense of menace activated by Hinds's Big Daddy provides a rationale for the mean-spiritedness spreading through his household like an oil slick. The husky-voiced Johansson, who won a Tony for her performance two years ago as the all-too-desirable dockworker's niece in Arthur Miller's ""A View From the Bridge,"" holds her own here, managing a persuasive account of Maggie's quick wits and pragmatic focus. What's missing, though, is her drawing a bead on the character's insecurities, the desperation that compels Maggie to cling to a lie - and to a man who reviles her.

She's less overtly sexy than other actresses who have played the ironic role, making her Maggie more cerebral, angry and proud.

But although director Laurence Connor has adhered to the basic contours of the original, his grittier approach exposes teeth in the material that I don't recall previously being so sharp.

What's lost in between is humanity or ambiguity, songs to tell us more about the characters' past, their quirks or inner nuances.

Okonedo is quietly forceful -- and ultimately heartbreaking -- as John's wife, accused of witchcraft so Abigail can get her husband, and Hinds is aptly imperious as the pious, self-serving deputy-governor...Although van Hove resists even a hint of cheap contemporary resonance, the village characters in their everyday work clothes connect the dots for us.

That being said, the production is, more often than not, absorbing and blazing with intensity...More importantly, why does one of the young girls levitate in the air at one point? Why does the set fall apart at a climactic moment? Is van Hove suggesting that the girls really do have supernatural abilities? Or, more likely, is this all just striking but overblown and overindulgent imagery?...These are all great actors, but they achieve uneven results in this twisted environment. Whishaw comes across as too weak and lacks chemistry with the fully aggressive Okonedo.

She's naked in her attraction to John Proctor, and the astonishing performance by Ben Whishaw in that role makes her desire entirely understandable. Whishaw delivers a very feral John Proctor, with something of the little-D devil in him...But at the heart of van Hove's direction is what the play is all about: how the perverse convergence of politics, greed, religion, and, yes, sex creates mass hysteria.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,03/31/2016

This Crucible features plenty of his signature flourishes, some more effective than others...Ben Whishaw and Sophie Okonedo, as the Proctors, give wrenching performances, shorn of vanity, as if the play's message of communal guilt had infected them personally...Saoirse Ronan as Abigail suggests no real excuse for her cold manipulations: She just shines with maleficence.",Vulture,Jesse Green,03/31/2016

Arthur Miller's play The Crucible, his raw if hyperbolic reenactment of the deadly Salem Witch Trials, struck a nerve when it first premiered in 1953 as a scorching condemnation of the House Un-American Activities Committee, then in the process of uprooting communists via innuendo, scare-mongering, and intimidation. The play's easy-to-understand themes of mob mentality and mass hysteria have made it Miller's most produced work (especially in high schools and colleges), yet in all honesty, the piece is somewhat flat when considered outside the allegory for McCarthyism.

The ensemble, led by Ben Whishaw, Sophie Okonedo, Ciaran Hinds, and Saoirse Ronan, is superb, and the play sustains its power to shock and thrill. But the directorial concept is baffling. In stripping down the context of ""A View from the Bridge"" earlier this season, van Hove did a brilliant job of isolating and illuminating the internal battle waged by its tormented hero to save his own soul.

Block) and son Jason (Anthony Rosenthal) to move in with his gay lover, Whizzer (Andrew Rannells); it then jumps forward to 1981, the dawn of the AIDS crisis, chronicling how this nontraditional family unit has expanded and then how it gets clobbered by the devastating reality of the time.

It's about time that William Finn and James Lapine's intimate, obstinate, heart-shattering 1992 musical has returned to Broadway, to poke us and amuse us and reduce us again to helpless tears. Few musicals have the range, idiosyncrasy and emotional punch of this profoundly unconventional and personal work. Directed by Lapine, the show's revival is very much about a specific Jewish family in the early 1980s, and while its story of a man who leaves his wife and child for a male lover may be less novel today, its larger truths continue to resonate.

Christian Borle can't resolve that contradiction and thus comes off a bit unsteady, at least until he regains his footing in the second act. The other principals, whose roles are more tightly written, are excellent throughout: Andrew Rannells delivering a super-high-gloss Whizzer without reducing him to a boytoy; Stephanie J.

Spencer Liff's choreography has some spry moments, like a dance that draws on bullfighting and Greco-Roman wrestling, but at other times seems oddly reticent. And while Borle is not precisely miscast, the role only rarely allows him to display his great strengths - his madcap comic verve, his brassy tenor.

Rannells, of ""Girls,"" brings swagger and sweetness to the pragmatic Whizzer. Block is blessed with a couple of the show's best songs - ""I'm Breaking Down"" and ""Holding to the Ground"" - and does them proud. Both are stuck in my head.

Walter almost sheens with success, on the surface; but the actor from the first allows us to see the depths that work beneath.

Ruffalo and Jessica Hecht, as Victor's frustrated wife, do creditable work, but Shalhoub falters; although he is persuasive at first, when Walter floats on silky smarm, his emotional scenes have a tinny ring. The play winds up in the pocket of Danny DeVito, making his Broadway debut as a charming old ganef of a furniture dealer. With so much character and history compressed into his small body, he is a good match for the play.

Ruffalo gives a lived-in, believable performance as the indecisive and unsatisfied cop. But it's a mystery why being a career cop was a fate worse than death. Hecht is persuasive as an acrid, long-suffering spouse who's unafraid to speak her mind. But Shalhoub's mannered performance jars and gums up the works. Judging by his deliberate cadence, he can't quite shake the character he recently played in the musical ""The Band's Visit.""",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,03/16/2017

Cattrall is all poise and perfect timing as Amanda, Elyot's double and opposite-number.",NY Magazine,Scott Brown,11/17/2011
Private Lives,7,An Enduring Marriage of Wit and Lust,"The show mostly steers clear of sourness because of our awareness of a redeeming self-consciousness in Amanda and Elyot.

Private Lives,7,Broadway's 'Private Lives' is 'big romantic stuff',"Director Richard Eyre and the cast succeed in a tricky balancing act for a play written in 1930: Keep the humor, but lose much of the affected, mannered performances - all those ""darlings"" and ""splendids"" and Coward bon mots - that often make his plays seem frothy and insubstantial.

Exquisitely contrived and capriciously sustained, Private Lives is one of his vintage almost-farces, a comedy of marital manners in which the divorced Amanda and Elyot find themselves in adjoining honeymoon suites in the South of France on second marriages. In short order they reunite in shock, feign apathy, fall in love again and adulterously elope, leaving their killjoy spouses (Simon Paisley Day, Anna Madeley) to track them down in Paris.",Time Out NY,David Cote,11/17/2011

They sing in falsettos and are utterly chilling...Rivera is as elegantly regal, funny and sly as always. Her billionaire is haughty and irritable but there's simply no denying her...""The Visit"" is sophisticated and beautiful and yet has that typical glorious chilling view of man that you expect from a Kander and Ebb show.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,04/23/2015

While Rees is a fine, sensitive actor, there's something unsatisfying about the way his role is drawn...Doyle and company access the mordant absurdist humor of Durrenmatt's work, but the chilling social and political critique...is diluted in the streamlined show...The big issue is one of repetitiveness, as McNally treads similar ground from character to character, without much complexity...Even Kander's score, with its lethargic but insistent Kurt Weill-style oom-pah circus rhythms, has a sameness at times...One of the production's rewards is the thrilling choral singing and exquisitely textured harmonies. But unquestionably, the reason to see The Visit, even with its flaws, is the star, whose brittle vocals cut like ice.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/23/2015
The Visit,9,'The Visit' review: Chita Rivera in a stunning show,"""The Visit"" is a haunting, haunted knot of Expressionist storytelling, a masterly 100-minute powerhouse with liltingly gruesome songs that create their own macabre world unlike anything onstage in recent memory. This will not be everyone's idea of a night on the town. But Rivera, an astonishing 82, is riveting as the mysterious, vengeful grand dame...Roger Rees is shattering, brimming with hapless vanity, as the pathetic shopkeeper who broke her heart so many years ago. Under John Doyle's taut, unflinching and strangely enchanting direction...the chamber work has the feel of a dark European fable -- albeit one with timeless theatricality. The music is woozy with disturbing dance rhythms, dripping with music-box sarcasm...Then there is Rivera, with her steely, gravelly voice and the resolve of a character who says, ""I am unkillable."" We dare you to take your eyes off her.",Newsday,Linda Winer,04/23/2015

The greater disappointment, however, is Rees, whose singing is simply painful to endure. His Anton is a small, broken man...Kander's music has never stopped evolving in its beauty, complexity and breadth, and the melodies here get under your skin even if the lyrics are not up to Ebb's best. McNally's compressed book does the job elegantly.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,04/23/2015
The Visit,8,Broadway Review: ‘The Visit’ Starring Chita Rivera,"The show is more literary piece than conventional musical. But it has a dark, sinister beauty -- and who could resist a visit from Chita?...And what a commanding figure she strikes...Like the play, McNally's musical treatment of the central dilemma doesn't add much tension to what seems a foregone conclusion. And, like the play, it begins well and ends well, but sags in the middle. The real problem, it seems, is the inadequacy of Anton's soul-searching about his own guilt. Rees looks very much like someone who's going through hell, and he expresses it well in ""Fear."" But this morally shabby character hasn't got an ethical leg to stand on. Kander just can't help himself. Even in what may well be his darkest work, he writes beautiful romantic melodies.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,04/23/2015
The Visit,8,Chita rises again in 'The Visit',"The excellent Roger Rees gives a nuanced, moving performance as the older Anton, and John Riddle embodies masculine grace playing him as a young man. But as Riddle and Veintimilla watch and shadow the more mature stars -- dancing and sometimes singing -- the mood becomes one of melancholy longing, bordering on melodrama. This seems at odds with the Brechtian vibe established by the severe-looking townsfolk surrounding them...In 100 minutes, Doyle thoughtfully touches on a range of subjects: mortality, bigotry, greed, revenge, regret...Ultimately, the show's most valuable asset is Rivera. Walking with a cane, the 82-year-old powerhouse expertly conveys her character's fragility and acerbic wit. Yet even while playing a woman who has been broken by bitterness, Rivera can't help but be a transcendent force. Her presence alone makes The Visit worth the trip.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,04/23/2015
The Visit,8,‘The Visit’ Review: As Long as the Lady is Paying…,"""The Visit"" is a cynical tragicomedy whose score is as gorgeous as its heart is hard...Kander's soaring, waltz-scented love songs are harmonized in an off-center manner subtly suggestive of dirty work at the crossroads...As for Ms. Rivera, who sounds like a cross between Hermione Gingold and Rex Harrison and is made up to resemble a walking mummy, she's all too terrifyingly believable as Claire...Mr. Rees, by contrast, is rather too ingratiating, and Mr. McNally's jokey book softens the impact of the play...But ""The Visit"" is horrifically potent in every other way...""The Visit"" isn't for everyone.

That's one big takeaway from ""The Visit,"" the thought-provoking and -- there's no other word for the experience -- bizarre musical...Rivera is provocative as Claire. The venerable actress is on stage for most of the production, and gets in a few chorus line kicks here and there...The two-time Tony winner has an entrance, in billowy white fur coat and hat, that's as thrilling as you'd want it to be...Rivera is solid, but it's the melancholy and soulfulness in Rees's performance that holds back ""The Visit"" from any risk of sliding into a parody of itself...Do everything in your powers to avoid having the ending spoiled.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,04/23/2015
The Visit,8,Chita Rivera gets her diva Broadway return in ‘The Visit’,"It's Chita Rivera's world: We just live in it. This works out very well for the Kander and Ebb musical ""The Visit,"" in which the charismatic star plays a billionairess who buys her hometown...It being by John Kander and the late Fred Ebb...delights in uncovering greed, hypocrisy and the perversion of justice. Admittedly, this isn't their strongest score...The ensemble is impeccable, save for Rees, who looked visibly uncomfortable at a recent performance and whose singing is serviceable at best.

The Visit,8,Theater Reviews: Airline Highway and The Visit,"...the version that has now arrived at the Lyceum represents not only a triumph of persistence but a distillation of many years' worth of theatrical savvy. It is as lean and as sere as a skeleton...Doyle is expert at stripping away the surface decoration and audience sops that can detract from the seriousness of the form...With The Visit, this creates a certain tension, though. You have, on one hand, the unimpeachably cold -- almost terrifying -- production design...On the other hand, you have Rivera, whom everyone adores and hopes to see succeed in a challenging role at age 82. This a tension that's useful, at least insofar as it puts the audience in sympathy with the devil...The songs, too, pull in two directions...The better the songs are, the weirder the show gets...Alienation and gregariousness make strange co-stars, but then so did Kander and Ebb.

Which is what gives Rivera's performance such resonance and power: She's cast way against type, and at age 82 she exposes a facet of her stage persona never seen before. Amazing! Rivera is well matched by Rees...Rees's Anton gets it coming and going. Rees doesn't possess a good singing voice...His acting, though, carries the performance.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,04/23/2015
The Visit,8,'The Visit': Chita Rivera stars in Broadway musical about revenge,"Watching Rees and Rivera...On Broadway, it feels far sadder and more plaintive, and perhaps a commentary on Europe's less than stellar record with outsiders. Most of all, though, ""The Visit"" now feels to be about the pain of growing older and, however rich we may or may not have grown, our inability to assuage our past mistakes, or even stop the demons that thud in our chests...It remains a weird musical, of course...Rivera is older now, and thus her Claire's determination for finality, her lack of any fear of anyone's death, makes more sense, especially when surrounded by Rees' cagey sadness (his performance is so complex and credible, it unlocks much previously hidden). Doyle, as one might expect from his past work, eschews literal staging. That works for this piece, aside from a few too many swings of a coffin.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/23/2015
The Visit,7,Review: Chita Rivera Stars in Kander and Ebb’s ‘The Visit’,"...despite a score that at its best has the flavor of darkest chocolate...""The Visit"" only rarely shakes off a stasis that suggests a carefully carved mausoleum frieze. Nor does the show ever quite make peace between its uneasily twinned strands of merciless cynicism and a softer sentimentality...The show's cynical and morbid components are more persuasive, if a tad monotonous...That ""The Visit"" still holds the attention has much to do with Ms. Rivera's command of the stage and her ability to find a concerto of feelings in what might have been a single-note role...Her singing voice, sharp-edged and resonant, is identifiably that of the original Anita in ""West Side Story"" but invested with an authoritative, all-knowing world-weariness.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,04/23/2015
The Visit,7,'The Visit' theater review,"Although it makes for a provocative thriller, the score is weak, dreary and derivative of Kander and Ebb's earlier work. Considering how Rivera and Rees are limited vocally, it may sound better with stronger singers. Doyle's streamlined and ultra-stylized production...is visually striking, but perhaps too ghoulish for its own good -- to the point of being excessively creepy and gloomy. Take, for instance, the two blind eunuchs who follow Clara around, wear clown makeup and speak in falsetto. Rivera, unquestionably a Broadway treasure, has the star quality and grand composure to play the diva-like Claire. By comparison, Rees portrays Anton as a sad, broken man, all too willing to meet his dismal fate.",amNY,Matt Windman,04/23/2015
The Visit,7,Chita Rivera stars in the Kander and Ebb musical 'The Visit' on Broadway,"The work is both recognizable Kander and Ebb style and a departure and is the last they created together...it comes across as something of a morality play or fable. Its book by Terrence McNally relies on symbolism and ideas more than multifaceted characters. Director John Doyle's staging and the music both call to mind a contemporary oratorio, with the company facing front for much of the staging and a score that pulls in dissonance, percussive noise and intricate textures. The form is fascinating, as are the central issues and the strangeness of the piece...But the book and lyrics can be blunt and redundant...As Claire...Rivera...savors her dry punch lines. Still, at this stage in her venerable career, she's mostly speak-singing, even when there's an appealingly eerie chorus of her countertenor eunuchs to back her. Roger Rees telegraphs excitement in his scenes with her, and we feel the weight on him as he considers his possibilities.",Star-Ledger,Ronni Reich,04/23/2015
The Visit,6,The Visit,"The version now on Broadway is the same I caught last summer at Williamstown Theatre Festival, and it remains fascinating and alluring, if finally repetitive and frustrating...studded with Kander & Ebb's Weill-and-vamp song stylings (however sleek and insinuating), it becomes a musical where the numbers retard the forward motion, which is, anyway, linear and predicable: Claire will have her revenge, and corruptible society will help her. Great acting wouldn't turn the mismatch into a great musical, but it also wouldn't hurt: Rivera, of course, is naturally commanding and regal, but a better dramatic actor would squeeze more mileage from Claire's mix of sadism and self-pity. Rees does well playing Schell as a husk of a man, but his Rex Harrison school of speak-singing drains power from the songs.",TimeOut NY,David Cote,04/23/2015
The Visit,6,‘The Visit’ review: Chita Rivera stars in shoulda-been-better Kander and Ebb musical of revenge,"Revenge is a dish served tepid in ""The Visit."" The warmth hobbles this stark musical fable by John Kander, Fred Ebb and Terrence McNally. With this team, the show is certainly worthwhile. But it could really send shivers -- and doesn't. ""The Visit"" pulls its punches...The score echoes earlier rhythms and melodies of Kander and Ebb and provides an evocative backdrop. Rivera's husky voice and high-watt charisma go a long way here. And it would have worked even better if director John Doyle's staging was less polite. Scott Pask's skeletal set and Ann Hould-Ward's raggedy clothes scream decay. But the performances don't go there...Wildcat? No. Claire and ""The Visit"" are too domesticated for their own good.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,04/23/2015
The Visit,6,The Visit review – vengeful Chita Rivera sharpens Kander and Ebb’s dark vision,"The pleasure in her performance and in Rees's and of Jason Danieley in the small role of the schoolmaster eclipse the blurriness of the story The Visit wants to tell. But only for a while. Though the show runs only 100 minutes, there's surely room for more plot and more emotional arc than it provides. And despite the omnipresence of a young Anton and a young Claire, sighing and swaying and occasionally screwing in the background, it can't really sell itself as a swoony weepie, however nice the ballads, particularly as it's in the more macabre numbers - ""Yellow Shoes"", ""I Will Never Leave You"" - that the tone seems most confident. However fine the songs and the set, it may not be visiting Broadway very long.",Guardian,Alexis Soloski,04/23/2015
The Visit,5,Aisle View: The Final Visit,"What remains--from my seat on the aisle, anyway--is non-gripping, non-chilling and non-savage; a toothless shell of the Dürrenmatt, with the bite removed.

But this revival really seems to draw its energy from the women - from Ambrose's damaged and determined Eliza, as well as Diana Rigg (Diana Rigg!) as the dry, wise, seen-it-all queen of common sense, Mrs. Higgins.

Designed as a pastel-colored, art nouveau jewel box, the 1963 show has been directed by Scott Ellis with effortless buoyancy and sophistication. It's also ideally cast, with an ensemble led by Laura Benanti, whose silvery soprano was born to sing this role.

The show itself, a 1963 stage version of ""The Shop Around the Corner,"" Ernst Lubitsch's 1940 romcom about two perfume-store clerks who love each other but don't know it, is the most romantic of all Broadway musicals.

The boutique and its colorful characters are brought to life beautifully...""She Loves Me"" has its dark plot twists, but the star turns are all bright. Benanti...reminds that she can do anything, given her incandescent soprano and comic timing. The show lifts off when she sings ""Vanilla Ice Cream"" and ""Will He Like Me?""

They bicker amusingly throughout the show, before realizing -- zero spoiler alert! -- that they're in love.

She Loves Me,9,Aisle View: Musical Candy Box,"Chief among the pleasures of this revival are the leading players, who take the innately charming material and add their own personal magic. Amalia is a soprano's dream; Barbara Cook created the role, turning the big aria ""Ice Cream"" into something of a standard for hard-singing heroines. (Cook originated not only ""Ice Cream"" but Leonard Bernstein's ""Glitter and Be Gay"" from Candide, two numbers that serve as something of a trial by fire for musical comedy leading ladies.) Here we have Ms. Benanti, who can match just about anyone in the vocal spotlight. What sends her performance over the top is her comedy skills; there is humor in the role, yes, but Benanti makes it downright funny. The bedroom scene, for instance (leading to ""Ice Cream""), plays like high comedy. Let it be added that the book by Joe Masteroff-who later turned his hand to Cabaret-works marvelously well.",Huffington Post,Steven Suskin,03/17/2016

Such is the discovery made by one Amalia Balash in the 1963 musical ""She Loves Me"" -- which has been rapturously revived in a new production by the Roundabout Theater Company -- when she receives a gift of this frozen confection from an unlikely suitor. As Amalia trills her delight in a song that flies toward heaven on ascending high notes, audiences for Scott Ellis's production...are likely to know exactly how she feels. That's partly because ""Vanilla Ice Cream""...is performed by Laura Benanti, an actress whose joyful soprano is a conduit for instant empathy...when embodied by a cast as expertly attuned as this one, which also includes a winning Zachary Levi and a scrumptious Jane Krakowski, it has a lingering and deeply satisfying sweetness usually lacking in brassier shows...The cheerful seamlessness of ""She Loves Me"" defies deconstruction.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,03/17/2016
She Loves Me,8,Review: Revival of ‘She Loves Me’ worth skipping work to see,"An astounding cast, a nifty story and memorable songs turn this revival into a celebration of classic musical construction. It's worth skipping work to see...Benanti charms from the moment she steps onstage but never coasts even though the role is firmly in her wheelhouse. She's genuinely buffeted by emotions that swing from disgust to fondness, and she is vocally in a league of her own, flawlessly knocking back the near-operatic demands of the part. Levi turns out to be no slouch either. The part requires a singer who can act and has comedic chops, and Levi nails it. He has the unenviable task of immediately following Benanti's triumphant, bed-bouncing ""Vanilla Ice Cream"" with the title song and yet he owns the stage as a heel-clicking giddy man suddenly in love. He even does a cartwheel.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,03/17/2016

As quarrelsome clerks in a Budapest perfume store in the heaven-sent She Loves Me, these two cuties irritate each other so much, they're obviously destined for cuddles and kisses...In a classic ""second couple"" subplot, the luscious Jane Krakowski plays a shopgirl having an ill-advised workplace affair with Gavin Creel's dapper cad. The Roundabout gets so much right in a splendid, joy-stuffed production: casting, design and even the reduced orchestra (guided with tremendous grace by Paul Gemignani)...Benanti, besides looking as lovely as ever and earning her laughs, shows off an old-fashioned soprano with affecting vibrato.

That was all Laura Benanti, who, as a lonely salesgirl, cries despairingly into her dessert while singing one of the more delicious confections from the classic rom-com...Benanti...brings an operatic quality to the role, wrenching emotion from songs such as ""Dear Friend."" As with her co-stars, there's a winking and self-conscious quality to her performance. Levi, as the shop's senior employee, has stepped up his game since his nice debut a few seasons back in ""First Date.""

Benanti and Levi are surrounded in the '30s Budapest shop by Jane Krakowski, delightfully adroit as the naughty-and-nice, unapologetically sexual co-worker, Gavin Creel as her dashing cad of a lover and Michael McGrath as the less theatrically assertive but no less essential salesman...And there are plenty of florid operetta demands for Benanti, who wears a role created by Barbara Cook with a lyrical yet sturdy sense of her character's worth and sense of humor.",Newsday,Linda Winer,03/17/2016

It's an unassuming, Old World charmer, testament to craft, witchcraft and romance that echoes the operettas of Romberg and Friml...and I'm thrilled to say that while I have aged, She Loves Me has not, not one bit. The score remains enchanting...This time the unlikely lovers are played by the infinitely appealing Laura Benanti (ABC's Nashville and a Tony winner for Gypsy) and Zachary Levi (NBC's Chuck), delightful as irritated co-workers in Maraczek's Parfumerie by day, swoony epistolary confidants by night...The team of Scott Ellis (director) and Warren Carlyle (choreography) let the show breathe.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,03/17/2016

David Rockwell's magnificent and ever-changing set design takes its cue from the book's pivotal object, a musical cigarette box being sold at a Budapest parfumerie in 1934...Levi and Benanti connect through their characters' mutual underlying loneliness. They're as charming as Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, those ""You've Got Mail"" stars, and they can also sing. Equally important, they never indulge in the usual musical-comedy tricks that attract Tony attention.

Benanti, with her thrilling voice and zany self-deprecation, is perfect casting for Amalia Balash...Their lyrics, by Sheldon Harnick, marry gentle wit to character development with the highest technical polish; his rhymes get laughs not because they're tricky but because they're so apt...These nearly prose observations miraculously sit on music, by Jerry Bock, that maintains their contours while flowering into arias of enormous beauty, especially for Amalia, who has a heavy stack of them to sell. This is where Benanti's gifts become crucial. She is, no surprise, a joy to listen to -- even when, as last night, recovering from bronchitis.

The production has been anticipated for the starring turn of three-time Tony nominee Condola Rashad in the title role.

Yet ""stripped down"" and ""spare"" are the words that come to mind when considering ""Sunset Boulevard,"" the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical that this month returns powerhouse star Glenn Close to Broadway as silent-screen recluse Norma Desmond, a role that earned her a Tony 22 years ago. This revival, directed by Lonny Price and now open at the Palace Theatre, was staged last year in London by the English National Opera. The entire West End cast has made the journey to New York, and be assured: aside from the enormous orchestra-and perhaps a bulbous chandelier that makes the one from ""Phantom"" seem like a toddler's night light-there's little here to distract from Close's mesmerizing Norma, or Lloyd Webber's pop friendly score.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,02/09/2017

This version once again stars Glenn Close in the role that won her a Tony Award 22 years ago, and the veteran actress reprises it magnificently.

At the end of ""Sunset Boulevard,"" Norma Desmond, the former silent screen star who has spent two decades in lonely obscurity, determinedly thrusts herself back into the spotlight, ready for either a close-up or the madhouse.

The director, Lonny Price, and the set designer, James Noone, have to work around all of that, as well as keep the Napier design out of your head, although they do come up with a series of simple but effective platforms that allow Close to appear in the rafters and then descend to her people, thus making two entrances for double applause.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,02/09/2017

The musical is presented here in the familiar Encores! style of semi-staged revivals by the English National Opera, directed by Lonny Price, and, surprisingly, feels less like a hokey entertainment straining for artistic importance than did the original.",Newsday,Linda Winer,02/09/2017

The mad clapping starts up again a few minutes later, when Glenn Close enters the proceedings, revisiting a role that twenty-two years ago won her the Tony. On the night I saw the show, even a single line of Close's dialogue -- the famous, ""I am big, it's the pictures that got small"" zinger -- generated a new round of cheers. This isn't merely the fault of an overeager audience, though. Director Lonny Price and his lead actress seem determined to force you out of the moment, overloading the production with so many ""Major Theatrical Event"" moments and signposts that it all starts to sag beneath the weight of its own self-importance.",NJ.com,Christopher Kelly,02/09/2017

To be sure, she is 69, much older than the 50-year-old character whom she plays, but that doesn't matter in the least. If anything, her greater age makes Norma's plight all the more pitiable, and Ms. Close's performance, by turns adamantine and childishly needy, is as memorable in its own way as was that of Gloria Swanson in the movie. No, the fundamental problem with turning ""Sunset Boulevard"" into a musical is that it is perfect, a fact that is well understood by Don Black and Christopher Hampton, whose book is largely faithful to the Wilder-Charles Brackett script, give or take a sprinkling of superfluous four-letter words (though their lyrics are sing-songy and ill-crafted). The truth is that ""Sunset Boulevard"" doesn't need songs, or anything else that it doesn't already have in abundance.

Her Norma Desmond often resembles Carol Burnett's TV parody of an aging silent film star though the latter had far more resemblance to a human being. Like Burnett, Close gives a bravura performance: funny, over-the-top, ridiculous. The only vulnerability Close brings to the role, however, is her singing voice. The actress was never a great singer, but managed to be adequate by Broadway standards.

Those who go to see Close reprise her celebrated turn in the musical's 1994 Broadway production will not be disappointed. There was a risk of Norma-like pathos in the prospect of the actress, now nearly 70, returning to a role she played more than 20 years ago-draped, no less, in her original Anthony Powell costumes, a fantastical array of capes and turbans and fur cuffs and animal prints.

Its daring mix of film noir and Hollywood satire requires the utmost finesse to carry off, lest it turn into camp, a mere coffin of curiosities. (We are in fact introduced to Norma as she kisses the corpse of her pet chimp.) That it doesn't go rancid - that the film remains beautiful despite its overbite - is attributable to Wilder's worldliness: No extreme of human behavior surprises or discomfits him. It may be impossible to achieve that kind of detachment in theatrical song, which pretty much defies a neutral point of view. Perhaps that's why Kander and Ebb gave up. As for Sondheim, who was writing with Jeanette MacDonald in mind for the lead, he dropped the project after Wilder told him at a cocktail party that the material could only work as an opera.",Vulture,Jesse Green,02/09/2017

Stripped bare of the accoutrements of poverty Williams so carefully articulated in the notes for his 1945 ""memory play,"" Gold (Fun Home) takes more seriously Williams' prefatory caution that ""everyone should know nowadays the unimportance of the photographic in art: that truth, life, or reality is an organic thing which the poetic imagination can represent or suggest, in essence, only through transformation"" free of the ""exhausted theater of realistic conventions...""",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,03/09/2017

The Glass Menagerie,9,The Glass Menagerie: EW stage review,"Field's is an anxiety-ridden, squirm-inducing performance - as her Amanda clings to unrealistic dreams for her children's future, her desperate neediness is at once funny and sad, understandable yet painful to watch. As Tom, Mantello brings the play's often-coded undertones to the forefront, delivering a virtuoso portrayal of a frustrated, closeted man crushed under the weight of his mother's loving expectations. It's no surprise that these veterans would be so successful, but the revelation here is Ferris. As a wheelchair user, she brings an element of realism and independence to a character normally played as helpless - for the first time, she seems strong and capable, though still terribly shy and non-confrontational. The audience seems to hold its collective breath as she maneuvers around the stage, and when her gentleman caller (a boisterous Finn Wittrock, American Horror Story) gets her hopes up only to break her heart, she poignantly runs through the full range of emotion. It's a brilliant bit of casting, even if the age difference between the actors requires some mental gymnastics...Gold takes risks with his nontraditional staging choices, and though his vision might not be for everyone, there's no arguing that it's a bold, creative one. The rare revival that breathes new life into a classic rather than defaulting to convention, this Menagerie is well worth another look.",Entertainment Weekly,Maya Stanton,03/09/2017

The American director's ""Glass Menagerie"" opened Thursday at the Belasco Theatre, and it is pure Gold in every sense of the word. Has there ever been a barer stage on Broadway? The four actors enter from a side door on the orchestra level, with Sally Field pushing newcomer Madison Ferris in a wheelchair. What follows is one of the evening's many silent longueurs as Ferris, a woman with muscular dystrophy, negotiates the small staircase to the stage to take her place there. Occasionally, she walks by pushing her buttocks in the air and taking steps on her feet and hands. But for most of the production, this Laura sits on the floor or in the wheelchair. It's odd to begin a review by concentrating on an actor's physical challenges, but that first long ascent to the stage pretty much establishes Field's tortured Amanda Wingfield and, in essence, Gold's take on ""The Glass Menagerie.""

There is no reason to close your eyes, but you could, and the actors' beautiful enunciation and encapsulation of Williams's words would be as pleasurable as the best radio play...When characters are not in scenes directly they observe them or sit a little away from them. The psychologically astute implication is that they are present in spirit, or will be affected by whatever is unfolding. This is Williams as seen at his most pared-back.

So Gold is performing a tricky balancing act: narrowing the scope of the representation and maintaining his cutting-edge cred while selling the story to an audience of 1,000. One of the casualties of this approach is what Tom calls ""the social background"" of the play. We lose not just the particular St. Louisness of it (the accents are nearly nil) but also the world-on-edge tension that Tom describes at the start: Guernica exploding in Europe, and, in America, ""the fiery braille alphabet of a dissolving economy."" Instead Gold focuses on a novel and largely convincing interpretation of the family's warfare as a symptom of the powerful but constraining love they share, and on the way both things shape Tom's character deep into the future from which he narrates.",Vulture,Jesse Green,03/09/2017
The Glass Menagerie,8,The Glass Menagerie review – Sally Field returns to Broadway in style,"Throughout, the production swirls realistic gestures with more expressionist ones. The theatricality is self-conscious, at times self-congratulatory. It estranges spectators from the characters and the situations - in ways more and less productive - yet still allows much of the language to be heard clearly and anew. (Gold's staging is often at odds with the script, but he only rarely has his actors play against the lines themselves.) As the play continues, it marshals a stealthy emotional force, designed to make Tom's departure that much more wrenching. Field portrays Amanda with sympathy and genteel bluster. In some scenes she and Mantello's sardonic Tom have a teasing rapport. This Laura's real physical impairment deepens and complicates her relationship with Tom, although as Ferris is far younger and less practiced than her castmates, the production asks her body to do too much of the work of the role.",The Guardian,Alexis Soloski,03/09/2017

The jagged, glistening shards of Tennessee Williams's breakthrough play are available for inspection in the revival that opened on Thursday night. Don't expect these pieces to be reassembled into an illuminating portrait of the anguished Wingfield family from this 1944 drama. Mr. Gold and his cast, led by an intrepid Sally Field, have dismantled a venerable classic, but darned if they can figure out how to put it back together again...On occasion, Mr. Gold's interpretation takes on the vicious aspect of a nightmare in which you see your past at its distorted worst. But even that vision is not sustained.

Picnic,7,Picnic: Theater Review,"While the heat between the central couple in director Sam Gold's Broadway revival could have been turned up a notch, the veil of melancholy hanging over the play's characters generates a quiet poignancy...Despite producing four popular and critical successes in the 1950s, Inge's work has proven less durable than that of some of his contemporaries. His plays lack the thematic expansiveness of Arthur Miller, or the sad poetry of Tennessee Williams. But as a snapshot of a time and place that shows the solitude of small-town life for so many people, women especially, Picnic yields gentle rewards.

Picnic,7,Picnic Is Back On Broadway: My Review,"Sam Gold's new production is a mixed-bag stab at the play, pumping up the comedy in the first half, then going for slower, more somber tones in the second...But for this play to work--for it to be an American answer to Chekhov, with Tulsa standing in for Moscow--it's got to have a burning attraction at the center of it. Unfortunately, while Sebastian Stan has the glistening body for Hal...his performance is too posturey...And while Maggie Grace is lovely as Madge, she doesn't carve a distinctive figure, and certainly not one who seems fated to run off with Hal and gamble with the rest of her life. So the play about dashed hopes colliding with awakened desires isn't nearly as electric as it could be, but it's still a vintage trip back to muddled 1950s morality and the poetic hopes that rose up in spite of it.",Village Voice,Michael Musto,01/13/2013

Ms. Grace...embodies Madge's small-town self-consciousness with an appealing ease...But except for in one dance sequence (nicely staged by Chase Brock), when Madge and Hal discover a shared rhythm, there's not much chemistry flowing between these two. Even clawing at each other's clothes, they somehow seem to be lost in their own, isolating thoughts. The same might be said of the cast as a whole.

No Man's Land,8,Review: Ambiguity Abounds in WAITING FOR GODOT & NO MAN'S LAND,"Director Sean Mathias and his talented quartet of actors (they are billed above the title alphabetically as Billy Crudup, Shuler Hensley, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart) do lovely service to both of them. No big bangs and whistles at the Cort Theatre; just a solidly acted pair of straightforward mountings that, despite all the attention paid to the two more famously named stage artists, serve the playwrights very well.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,11/24/2013
No Man's Land,8,Filling the Existential Void,"These productions mostly stay, comfortably and tantalizingly, on the surface. But in doing so, they also bring out the beguiling polish and shimmer in Pinter and Beckett’s language. These shows allow us to appreciate the great paradox in some of the best dialogue ever written, which uses eloquence to plumb the futility of speech.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,11/24/2013
No Man's Land,8,Reviews: Pairing Up Waiting for Godot and No Man’s Land,"This is all quite hilarious, going well beyond the old British trope of mistaken identity into the realm of existential terror. The comedy arises from the contrast between that terror, mostly interior to the two men individually, and the tortuous forms of speech they’ve evolved to keep it that way. No cliché is left unturned. (Of his mother, Spooner says, “I was fortunate to escape with my life.”) And while Hirst may seem at first too decrepit to play with words — in Act One Stewart squeezes great comedy out of merely considering saying something — he emerges in Act Two suddenly hale and lucid. This is extreme but not absurd. Who has not felt the shock of other people’s alteration? Or the slow apprehension of one’s own?",Vulture,Jesse Green,11/24/2013
No Man's Land,8,No Man's Land/Waiting for Godot: Theater Review,"McKellen takes on the choicest of the main roles in the poet Spooner, an obsequious sponge who has met well-heeled man of letters Hirst (Stewart) over drinks in a local pub and accompanied him to his home near Hampstead Heath for a few more. In designer Stephen Brimson Lewis’ austere set, the host’s living room is both a statement of stifling tastefulness and a scary cell in which Spooner, a shabby drunk despite his posturing refinement, is unceremoniously imprisoned for the night by Hirst’s hostile amanuensis Foster (Crudup) and his intimidating butler/bodyguard Briggs. With their air of homoerotic complicity, this domestic duo claim to be Hirst’s protectors, viewing Spooner suspiciously as an intruder who might upset their status quo.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,11/24/2013
No Man's Land,8,Review: Beckett and Pinter revivals on Broadway done real justice by McKellen and Stewart,"McKellen's Spooner is an overly voluble, romantic lush with a moocher's heart, wearing a worn suit and dirty white canvas shoes.

It’s unclear if Hirst and Spooner really know each other from university. Also uncertain: Did Hirst, as he blithely recalls, bed Spooner’s girl? McKellen’s silent slow-burn response speaks volumes. He’s got one of the most expressive faces, voices and command of body language on the planet. Stewart gets Hirst’s imperiousness and vulnerability just right.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,11/24/2013

Watch him, at age 74, get down on his knee to tie one shoe lace, only to perform a nimble bent-knee leap to tie the other. Audiences may find that his verbal and physical dexterity makes for a lighter, more digestible night at the theater, but it also diminishes the desperation that drives Spooner, a down-and-out poet, into the no man’s land of another writer’s well-appointed, servant-infested manse.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,11/24/2013

Pierpont Finch (Daniel Radcliffe) rises by cunning degrees from window washer to chairman of the board. Every nanosecond of this well-cast production is eloquent with craft and wit. But the laurels of the evening go to Radcliffe and the towering John Larroquette, as the boss, J. B. Biggley. Radcliffe’s youthful brightness is a perfect foil for Larroquette’s dopey severity.

On the surface, the British actor - with his squat, compact body and somewhat pasty complexion - seems an unlikely leading man. Though he has a stronger singing voice than Broderick and a limber, go-for-it approach to director Rob Ashford's exhaustingly acrobatic choreography, he's not a natural, effortless triple threat. But like Finch, he seems to be tapping into an almost bottomless reserve of willpower and determination to claim his place in the spotlight of a big-budget Broadway musical.

With Ashford's flair, Radcliffe's dogged discipline and great good humor, and a deep bench of performing talent, How to Succeed-written as a poke at at the gray-flannel innards of a mid-century business behemoth-moves with the fleet feet and bright-eyed buoyancy of a startup.

Needless to say, it's Daniel Radcliffe, better known as Harry Potter, who's filling the seats, but it's Mr. Ashford who deserves most of the credit for the artistic success of this hard-charging, high-flying revival of a show whose gleaming craftsmanship is as self-evident today as when it opened on Broadway a half-century ago.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,03/29/2011

To be blunt, Radcliffe is not a Broadway singer. His voice is nice, but thin and he strains to fill the theater - ""American Idol"" judge Randy Jackson would call it ""pitchy."" Somehow it doesn't matter. He works so hard that we're on his side even if he, like his character, doesn't have the creds. Plus, there's so much here that works: songs by Frank Loesser; a delightfully cynical book about corporate behavior that resonates today; Derek McLane's sets made of massive interlocking cubes; and Catherine Zuber's wickedly clever costumes, not to mention Ashford's cheer-inducing choreography that even takes advantage of Radcliffe's small stature and Larroquette's tall one.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,03/28/2011

Tammy Blanchard also shines as Biggley's dimwitted mistress, bringing sassy swagger and comic panache to the bimbo role. John Larroquette's Biggley is less of an instant hit, showing even more of a tendency to rush through lines than Radcliffe does, though with less obvious character-based incentive. But Larroquette grows funnier and more lovable as the show progresses, and manages an endearing chemistry with the considerably younger (and shorter) leading man.

He doesn't come off as someone trying to act earnest to get ahead but as someone who's just plain earnest. It's weird. But he's perfectly game and is to commended for continually trying to break out of his ascribed teen idol role. Alas, the big number ""I Believe In You"" falters without any sense of unrequited self love to propel it. Ironically, Radcliffe looks terrified!

The beguiling Rose Hemingway imbues Rosemary with a self-assured sexuality and has a very pretty voice, though she and Radcliffe lack that crucial spark. Radcliffe connects slightly more with Larroquette, who is delicious as Biggley and tremendous in his scenes with the superb Tammy Blanchard as his vamp of a paramour, Hedy LaRue. Blanchard’s Hedy is not a dumb bimbo, she’s a cunning Jersey girl, a smarter version of Snooki. Mary Faber has some very nice moments as the sex-starved secretary Smitty, Christopher J.

The answer is a qualified yes. The young actor has clearly worked hard, very hard, and while his singing is merely pleasant at best, he displays a very likeable and charming stage presence as J. Pierrepont Finch, the relentlessly ambitious schemer working his way up the corporate ladder. He lacks the inspired comic impishness of such predecessors as Robert Morse and Matthew Broderick—his too earnest delivery of the classic self-love number “I Believe in You” falls flat, for instance—but his youthful eagerness serves him well here.

How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,6,Daniel Radcliffe doesn't quite succeed,"Making his first foray into musical comedy and stepping into a part made famous by Robert Morse, Radcliffe is a likable but very boyish presence. He shows off a pleasant singing voice as corporate climber J. Pierrepont Finch, but he's waxen and not animated enough to make Finch soar. His take on his character's personal pep talk, ""I Believe in You,"" emerges dispiriting. Still, director-choreographer Rob Ashford's production is bright, cheerful and energetic, that's for sure.

His timing is sharp, his dancing precise, his American accent impeccable; but his singing is shaky, and he doesn’t quite have the demonic spark of self-assurance that made Robert Morse a star in the role.

Every time Finch turns to the spotlight with a conspiratorial acknowledgement that the plan for advancement is working to perfection, the audience roared in hysterics. His voice, pleasantly serviceable but not distinguished, worried me in his first number, ""How to Succeed."" The singing improved as the show went on, but he's no Robert Morse, who originated the role with so much musical theater élan and effortless personality (as the film version wonderfully documents) that comparisons are invidious. But then this revival would very likely never have come into existence without the Harry Potter hordes. Looking into the crystal ball, I see fewer musicals and more dramatic comedies in Radcliffe's future. He'll never match Hugh Jackman's versatility, but there's no shame in being a likable 2 1/4 threat.",Los Angeles Times,Charles McNulty,03/27/2011

Master Class,6,Master Class Looks at Callas Behavior,"Daly, a forceful, convincingly complex presence in the coaching scenes, seems uncertain and unfocussed in the reveries (where Stephen Wadsworth's scattershot staging doesn't help). The four colleagues who play her students and their accompanist do well. It's particularly reassuring to hear Sierra Boggess produce her lustrous upper register without the belting that made her Little Mermaid an earache-causer, proof that well-trained voices can withstand even Disney disasters.",Village Voice,Michael Feingold,07/13/2011
Master Class,5,She's no callous Callas,"Daly achieves a decent approximation of Callas' look thanks to spot-on makeup and a wig. But while she's a terrific actress, her basic earthiness is at odds with the role of the refined woman nicknamed ""La Divina."" Daly nails the catty asides about Callas' peers and can switch from imperious to coyly flirtatious in the blink of an eye. But there are also times when you wonder if Callas is coaching aspiring opera singers or a softball team. And when she drops the soprano's signature ""eh"" at the end of sentences, Daly's lands in the Atlantic somewhere between Italy and Canada.",New York Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,07/07/2011
Master Class,3,Master Class,"Lacking Callas's elegance, the estimable Tyne Daly nonetheless controls the stage and the audience with command, and lends shading to the writing wherever she can; less successful are the three actors playing her students, guided with a heavy hand by Stephen Wadsworth. The pedagogical sequences, at least, have a patina of high culture, unlike the pair of vulgar, melodramatic flashbacks about Callas's doomed affair with Aristotle Onassis that form the climaxes of both acts. ""This is a master class, not a psychiatrist's office,"" she announces early on-to no avail. Stripping La Divina of both mastery and class, McNally shrinks her with a vengeance.",Time Out New York,Adam Feldman,07/07/2011
The Father,8,Review: ‘The Father’ Examines the Lion’s Mind in Winter,"...Frank Langella, one of the most magnetic theater actors of his generation...As you may have gathered, ""The Father"" offers one of the most disorienting experiences in town. Yet, as directed by Doug Hughes, this Manhattan Theater Club production exudes a cool clarity that borders on the clinical...Donald Holder's expert lighting leans more toward institutional uniformity than creeping shadows - though every so often, it shifts in ways that make you wonder if your eyes aren't playing tricks on you...everyone seems rather puny, compared with Mr. Langella's André, which is the intention. Dementia is ugly, but it is also inherently tragic. That's what Shakespeare saw in King Lear (himself a precursor to the absurdist existential hero). Mr. Langella impressively played that role several years ago, but it's here, in a more prosaic context, that he nails the rage, pathos and cruelty behind that titanic part....",New York Times,Ben Brantley,04/14/2016
The Father,8,BWW Review: Frank Langella Gives a Commanding Turn in Florian Zeller's THE FATHER,"Under Doug Hughes' direction, Langella makes fluid transitions from charmingly self-assured to nervously befuddled to positively terrified. The 90-minute piece serves better as an actor's showcase than a satisfying play, and the star subtly and believably builds to a shuddering climax.

The Father, though, is only a might-see play, more of a vehicle than a destination...Langella, who in some plays threatens to devour everyone else onstage, is here well matched by a cast of actors who perform their own seductions and know how to find their light.

Not with ""The Father,"" which is really one long mad scene. Langella's larger-than-life performance becomes the character's way of trying to hang on to life...Zeller has underwritten the supporting characters, and director John Hughes is wise to keep those performances very understated. Especially fine are Kathleen McNenny as the woman and Charles Borland as the man. There's something menacing in how matter of fact they are when interacting with the totally bewildered Andre...",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,04/14/2016
The Father,8,‘The Father’ review: Frank Langella gives powerhouse performance,"..The audience can never be sure what's going on, where we are or who everyone is in ""The Father,"" a jarring and intense French drama by Florian Zeller (translated into English by Christopher Hampton) that is told from the perspective of an 80-year-old man suffering from severe dementia...Doug Hughes' focused production is built around an all-out, highly emotional performance from Langella that brings to mind King Lear's extreme fall from security into chaos...a dramatically effective and culturally important one that forces the audience to see the world through the eyes of someone with dementia and identify with him. It should be mandatory viewing for anyone who knows a person with dementia.",amNY,Matt Windman,04/14/2016
The Father,8,'The Father': Theater Review,"In technical terms, this is an accomplished piece of writing, but there's little heart in it for a play that plumbs such despair, both for the afflicted central character and the family member closest to him. The work will no doubt resonate for audiences with direct experience of a loved one suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's. But a drama that explores such gnawing relatable fears shouldn't have to rely on personal associations for pathos. Zeller's enigmatic construction does skillfully place us inside the woolly head of Andre and make us share in his confusion. But unlike another British import, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, which also gave us direct access to the mindset of a character grappling with perception issues, the stiffness of the writing here leaves relatively little room for empathy.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/14/2016
The Father,8,The Father review – Frank Langella devastates in study of dementia,"Parts of the play can feel somewhat too pat, as though Zeller is amusing himself in finding out how many ways he can alter reality using the familiar mechanisms of the stage - an audience's trust of exposition, the faith in representational setting, the tendency to identify a particular character with a single actor. But he dismisses most of this cleverness in an ending that is both sentimental and searing and will probably devastate anyone who has seen a close friend or relative suffer from dementia. The final scene is a terrible and tragic reversion, in which a man of articulacy and power is reduced to a kind of infantilism, left with with no language but a cry.",Guardian,Alexis Soloski,04/14/2016
The Father,7,Broadway Review: ‘The Father’ Starring Frank Langella,"There's no real drama to the basic structure of the play, just the ruthless forward movement of one man's inevitable fate unfolding.

The Father,7,Frank Langella Brings ‘The Father’ To Broadway; F. Murray Abraham’s ‘Nathan The Wise’ Downtown – Review,"The Father was a hit in Paris and London and is smoothly translated by Christopher Hampton (Les Liaisons Dangereuses)...But Doug Hughes' production...seems slight at 90 intermissionless minutes. The exception, of course, is Langella, giving another master class in felt performance as André regresses - devolves, really - from strong-willed fighter to whimpering babe... It's a performance of surpassing empathy, and sadness.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,04/14/2016
The Father,7,"Theater review: Frank Langella returns to Broadway in ‘The Father,’ a compelling but sometimes slick show","With three Tonys on his shelf, Frank Langella knows his way around a Broadway stage. That includes when he's playing someone lost in the dark clouds of dementia...Written by rising-star French author Florian Zeller and translated by Christopher Hampton (""Les Liaisons Dangereuses""), this 90-minute play comes with 15 scenes and a compelling conceit. You must walk a mile in Andre's slippers to experience what it's like to lose your marbles. And you will...At its best, Zeller's writing is crisp, darkly humorous and emits a hushed Pinteresque chill. On the down side, the play is so sterile it sidesteps the mess that comes with mental deterioration...Doug Hughes' direction in the Manhattan Theatre Club staging also cuts both ways...Fortunately, though, Langella is forever intriguing.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,04/14/2016
The Father,7,Volatile Langella Loses Grip on Reality in MTC's 'The Father',"..Because ""The Father"" is presented from the view of Langella's André, a retired Parisian engineer-or perhaps a tap dancer?-we can't be sure what's actually happening and what's his imagination...The three-time Tony Award winner (currently on FX's ""The Americans"") brings trademark versatility to the role, alternating from aggressive, to lucid and charming, then insecure and infantile. Langella's mercurial performance surely will be relatable to any audience member who has spent time around a person with dementia...Much of ""The Father"" is a delusion, and so we work to form our own conclusions about what's real or not, even as André's shifting reality guides us toward a foreshadowed ending. This is an intricately constructed drama depicting a phenomenon few can identify with-what it must be like to be a capable person slowly losing his mind.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,04/14/2016
The Father,7,Amazing Frank Langella saves another mediocre show,"While the role of an elderly man slowly losing his marbles could have lent itself to some mugging - Florian Zeller did subtitle his play ""a tragic farce"" - Langella is fairly restrained.

In The Father, he adds something new to his well-honed arsenal of actorly skills. After lulling us into thinking, over the first hour of this ninety-minute play, that this is just another one of those excellent failing-old-men performances, the ground slips from under him (and us)-at which point the actor, and his audience, feel an altogether new kind of terror.",Huffington Post,Steven Suskin,04/14/2016

The Father,7,'The Father' on Broadway is a sour look at an aging man,"Once it becomes apparent what Zeller is up to, ""The Father"" has nowhere to go - it merely marks time until André completes his dreary spiral into despair and complete confusion. The ever-amazing Langella keeps this watchable for as long as possible, giving us an André who is alternately charming and irksome, pitiable and pathetic. But by the time this poor man is getting slapped around (or is he?) by a man who may or may not be his son-in-law, ""The Father"" has turned repetitive and sour. What's the point of this hall-of-mirrors, other than to reflect back the ugliness of humanity?",NJ.com,Christopher Kelly,04/14/2016
The Father,7,Arts and Entertainment Frank Langella in the disappointingly prosaic ‘The Father’,"""The Father"" - not of course, to be mistaken for the unnerving August Strindberg play of the same title - lumbers on in this vein for an hour and a half. The turbulent turns in Andre's powers of perception may strike one as unpredictable, but Zeller and Hampton's machinations do not. Langella is a bit too robust for a man so ravaged by mental deterioration. Still, he's in his element here, conveying with Lear-like levels of outrage and hurt Andre's refusal, or inability, to comprehend what is happening to him. As a demonstration of how Alzheimer's runs its course, Hughes's production has some merit: It might be serve as a useful training tool for medical schools. As illness-of-the-week plays go, however, ""The Father"" is mundane. Much finer works, such as Margaret Edson's ""Wit,"" about a professor dying of ovarian cancer, have crossed this company's path in the past.",Washington Post,Peter Marks,04/14/2016
The Heiress,9,Review: Chastain gets ugly in 'The Heiress',"The latest revival of ""The Heiress"" has done the near impossible - it's drained the light from one of the most luminous actresses working today. In a good way. Jessica Chastain, that ravishing redhead with the milky skin who shot a dose of bubbly charm to the film ""The Help,"" turns almost ghoulish in the title role…What's left is a skittish woman with hollow eyes, a simply horrible hostess who, when she speaks, does so in a dull monotone. Even her hair looks mousy. Full credit goes to Chastain, who has buried herself in dullness to play one of theater's more formidable proto-feminist roles. The men in her life - David Strathairn plays her father and Dan Stevens of ""Downton Abbey"" her suitor - aren't too shabby either, each turning in performances that are complex and sympathetic. Neither actor, under the superb, subtle direction of Moises Kaufman, emerges as a straw man.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,11/01/2012
The Heiress,9,STAGE REVIEW The Heiress,"Director Moisés Kaufman's crisp, first-rate production finds an admirable complexity in Ruth and Augustus Goetz' 1947 drama, based on the Henry James novel Washington Square. In her Broadway debut, Chastain conveys social discomfort and awkwardness without veering into caricature. In the second act, as her mouse of a character gradually learns to roar, the uniquely American arc of this tragedy comes into sharper focus.",Entertainment Weekly,Thom Geier,11/01/2012
The Heiress,9,'The Heiress' finds the light in darkness,"In the end, it's up to the leading lady to ensure that we care about Catherine, rather than seeing her as a distressed damsel in a quaint melodrama.

It's a nuanced, compassionate performance that bodes well for the actress' future, on stage and off.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,11/01/2012
The Heiress,9,The Heiress,"If you can overlook the absurdity of casting the ravishing Jessica Chastain as the plain and clumsy heroine of ""The Heiress,"" Ruth and Augustus Goetz's 1947 stage adaptation of ""Washington Square,"" then Moises Kaufman's masterfully helmed production is everything you want from a Class A revival. As is proper for a costume drama, the costumes are mouthwatering. The set is just as scrumptious, and the cast seems entirely comfortable speaking the language and thinking the thoughts of people from a bygone era -- David Strathairn so much so, you'd swear he goes up the staircase to bed each night after the show.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,11/01/2012

And the actor is a savvy casting choice in a part that requires beguiling charm and sufficient sincerity to keep us wondering about his character’s motives. But the good news doesn’t extend to the actress in the title role of this plush Broadway revival. An underpowered Jessica Chastain, hampered by questionable directorial choices, dilutes the emotional impact of this nonetheless compelling melodrama...This is juicy, high-toned melodrama, and for the most part, stylishly executed. It’s possible that, as the run progresses, Chastain might find more secure footing, placing a bolder stamp on the central role to capture the spark that’s currently missing.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,11/01/2012

The Heiress,8,Theater Review: 'The Heiress',"While ""The Heiress"" might fall short of being great dramatic literature, it does make for an entertaining star vehicle filled with elaborate turn-of-the-century costumes, references to high society and plenty of bold dramatic gestures…what really distinguishes [Chastain's] performance, which marks her Broadway debut, is how she convincingly evolves from an insecure, loving young girl into a steely, bitter woman. Stevens, who plays Matthew Crawley on the English television series ""Downton Abbey,"" also makes a fine New York stage debut, hiding his character's unsavory motives behind a sunny, guileless facade. Strathairn maintains a dour disposition to the role of the doctor, while Judith Ivey brings a sweet and lively presence as Catherine's warm aunt Lavinia.",amNY,Matt Windman,11/01/2012

The Heiress,7,Interior Designs Conceal a House’s Dark Corners,"Wearing a mousy brown wig and hunching her shoulders, Ms. Chastain improbably manages to simulate homeliness. And her face registers feelings sharply and legibly. But, curiously for an expert film actress, she is guilty here of oversignaling the thoughts within. She plays Catherine’s spinsterish awkwardness for broad comedy in the early scenes. And her delivery of dialogue sometimes has a flatness that I associate with cold readings of scripts. This is surely a conscious choice, but it has the effect of making Catherine seem even more, uh, mentally challenged than usual. And I never felt the urgency of filial and romantic love festering into vengeful hatred, which should inform any production of “The Heiress.”",New York Times,Ben Brantley,11/01/2012

The Catherine Sloper of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's 1947 play The Heiress (which is merely ""suggested"" by Washington Square) is a bright young thing buried under a bushel of insecurities, crippled by an awkward fashion sense and near-cataleptic social anxiety.

Arcadia,9,Tom Stoppard's thrilling 'Arcadia',"Arcadia, back on Broadway for the first time since 1995, is a heady, aching thrill of a tragicomedy.

Riley could have come right out of a Jane Austen novel; he's witty, dashing, and completely crushable (a very important plot point). Williams is wonderfully prickly and has terrific chemistry with both Crudup and Raúl Esparza, who plays Valentine, the eccentric mathematician descendant of Thomasina. Crudup — who made his Broadway debut as Septimus, then won a 2007 Tony in Stoppard's The Coast of Utopia — appears to be acting in overdrive; perhaps he's just excited to be in a Stoppard play without being stuck in the 19th century.

Arcadia,8,An Exquisite Revival of Arcadia Could Use a Wee Bit More,"Sex hangs over Arcadia like a fine English fog, and personally, I’d have preferred it even thicker. Nothing sets off Stoppard’s crystalline intellect like a nice, rude intrusion of carnality and folly. But Leveaux has directed his cast members to turn inward, and perhaps that’s ultimately the better choice. I admit to being a little flummoxed by Crudup’s Bernard; he’s playing a character more or less alien to American audiences, the flibbertigibbet rake, and he bridges the gap with doses of downcast American irony and tics that sometimes come close to clowning. But his approach won me over by Act Two, when Bernard’s limitations as a person and a character come into fuller view.

Arcadia,7,Arcadia,"Tom Stoppard's eloquent play ""Arcadia"" operates much like the iterated algorithm graphs of which it speaks. Individual dots randomly appear, until gradually a shape (e.g., meaning) is revealed. Further, these dots often appear due to understated moments or quiet subtextual inferences.

Kevin Kline was born to do Noel Coward, and his casting as Garry Essendine, the 1930s stage star and aging playboy at the center of his own eternal melodrama in Present Laughter, yields a performance of unimpeachable skill, made all the more delectable by its lightness of touch. Matching witty verbal jousts with florid gesticulation, and head-to-toe body language that constitutes its own uniquely refined brand of physical comedy, Kline etches a character pulled between conceited selfishness and encroaching melancholy, a coddled man-child helpless without a captive audience.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/05/2017

But not any Moritz will do. Find the one who helmed the equally hilarious but tonally rather different demon-possessed-sock-puppet satire Hand to God.

Present Laughter,8,Present Laughter: EW stage review,"Kline appears to be having the time of his life onstage at the St. James Theatre, where the latest Broadway revival of this 1939 drawing-room comedy opened Wednesday. It's a fast-paced and straightforward production, directed by Moritz von Stuelpnagel, featuring two equally delightful and delighted costars - the goofily irresistible Kristine Nielsen as Essendine's stalwart secretary, Monica, and Kate Burton, steely and wry as his devoted not-quite-ex-wife, Liz - plus a mixed bag of supporting players and a jam-packed Edwardian flat of a set, designed by David Zinn, that gets its own entrance applause.",Entertainment Weekly,Jesse Oxfeld,04/05/2017

In an age of lesser stars, he's a bona fide matinee idol of the ideal age and with the urbane sensibility to do justice to sophisticated scribes like Noel Coward. ""Present Laughter"" is a delicious drawing-room comedy that Coward dashed off in 1942 to amuse himself and his friends, while engaging in a bit of sober self-reflection.

Present Laughter,7,Review: Kevin Kline Serves Ham in Soignée Silk in ‘Present Laughter’,"It's high time we were reminded again of what a great physical comedian Kevin Kline is. Playing an aging matinee idol in the bouncy new revival of Noël Coward's ""Present Laughter,"" Mr. Kline blissfully plies the witty athleticism and derring-do that won him two Tony Awards (""On the 20th Century,"" ""The Pirates of Penzance"") and an Oscar (""A Fish Called Wanda"") in his youth. In the uneven but enjoyable production, which opened on Wednesday at the St. James Theater, directed by Moritz von Stuelpnagel, Mr. Kline makes his entrance in a state of soigné disarray.

Present Laughter,7,‘Present Laughter’ review: Kevin Kline shines bright on stage,"With all due respect to Noel Coward's classic English comedies of the 1920s through 1940s, do they really merit being revived so regularly? Sure, they're witty, classy and charming, but also insubstantial and tame by today's standards, and not especially relevant anymore. I suspect that we run into the plays so often because they contain great roles for actors, like the kooky medium Madame Arcati in ""Blithe Spirit,"" the sparring couple Amanda and Elyot in ""Private Lives"" and the vain stage actor Garry Essendine in ""Present Laughter.""",amNY,Matt Windman,04/05/2017

Present Laughter,7,Kevin Kline Does His Best Noel Coward: Review of ‘Present Laughter’,"Something in the writing of Present Laughter never raises the stakes to the level of gasping hilarity that true farce can elicit. The urbanity, wit, self-possession, and control of Garry, Monica, and Liz mean that we never think the demons they have to ward off will do as much as even graze their knees. There's no real driving plot in Present Laughter, just a battery of Coward's mots at their most bon. And like the best houseguest, just before it outstays its welcome, it takes its leave.",Daily Beast,Tim Teeman,04/05/2017
Present Laughter,7,Theater Review: Noël Coward’s Present Laughter Is Ever-Modern,"His moral comedy is undiminished. The scene in which he finally calls out the sexual subterfuges of his comrades - and definitively rids himself of his own extraneous women - successfully counterweights the play's many trivialities. Most of the rest of the cast, under the direction of Moritz von Stuelpnagel, seems to have got the same memo: Play the problems, not the jokes. I was especially impressed with the women. Cobie Smulders, a star of How I Met Your Mother making her Broadway debut as Joanna, not only looks sensational in gowns by Susan Hilferty but finds a core of valor in a typically odious character. Kate Burton - who played the ingénue Daphne opposite George C. Scott in 1982 - brings exceptional clarity and warmth to Liz, who can sometimes come off as a scold. And Kristine Nielsen is hilarious as the trusty secretary Kristine Nielsen.",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/05/2017
Present Laughter,6,Present Laughter review – Kevin Kline can't find the funny in a classic,"Dressing gown enthusiasts can rejoice at the return of Garry Essendine in the latest Broadway revival of Present Laughter. Not that Garry ever stays offstage very long. Noël Coward's creation, he made his debut in 1942, played by his author, and hasn't strayed far from the boards ever since. Has he aged well? Yes and no, as demonstrated by Kevin Kline's silky turn in the current production, a performance of stupefying charm that reveals some of the wrinkles and sag in the surrounding play.",The Guardian,Alexis Soloski,04/05/2017
Present Laughter,6,"Present Laughter starring Kevin Kline – review at St James Theatre, New York – ‘lugubrious’","The result is that laughter is only intermittently present. It feels lugubrious and weighty rather effortless.

Skylight,9,"Mulligan, Nighy offer searching 'Skylight'","But Hare's play is not a polemic, and the chasm that has grown between Tom and Kyra owes to more than political differences. In this U.K.-based production, directed with compassion and brutal clarity by Stephen Daldry, both emerge as flawed, sympathetic, believable human beings...This Tom, for all his superficial arrogance, is a man overwhelmed with restlessness...We see the flickers of shame and vulnerability behind his imperiousness. Mulligan's Kyra has her own nervous energy, but is more palpably weighed down by repressed passion, and guilt...Sad-eyed and draped in an oversize sweater, Mulligan seems almost physically transformed by her character's premature weariness...Whether Kyra and Tom can reconcile or not, this Skylight assures us, both will endure -- as will the troubled, contradictory world around them.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,04/02/2015
Skylight,9,‘Skylight’ Review: Bill Nighy & Carey Mulligan Spark And Smolder In David Hare Revival,"...Nighy and co-star Carey Mulligan have a brilliant vehicle worthy of their complementary talents. Piloted with exceptional sensitivity by Stephen Daldry and beautifully designed by Bob Crowley and Natasha Katz, this revival is as fine as the original -- while being utterly different in texture, tone and impact...Hare...refuses to stack the deck, giving us full rein to fall under the spell of both Tom and Kyra as they inevitably succumb to the forces that both brought them together and tore them apart...Nighy...exudes a to-the-manor-born elegance that's heightened by the nervous tics of a febrile personality used to getting his way...Mulligan casts a hypnotic spell, playing combativeness and vulnerability in perfect balance. The result is riveting, as absorbing a drama as can be seen anywhere this season, played at the highest level...Skylight is a keeper and this revival is one for the ages.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,04/02/2015
Skylight,9,Bill Nighy and Carey Mulligan Triumph in ‘Skylight’,"I don't know many authors who can so seamlessly blend comedy and sadness the way Hare does. Or perhaps weld is the better word, because there is no pulling apart the joy and sadness in this play, the outcome of which, while most assuredly inevitable, is never predictable...I can't imagine any actors serving Hare better than these actors do. [Mulligan] inhabits her role as though it were written just for her...She completely embodied the role of the earnest schoolteacher Kyra Hollis...Nighy is Nighy, you could say. He has gestures, inflections, rhythms, and body language that follow him from project to project. All true, and yet I don't know any actor who, at a deeper, more profound level, inhabits a character the way he does...Skylight isn't some exhausting O'Neill-like epic, but it is an intense experience. It picks you up and hurls you along for two hours, and then resolves with such dramatic rightness that you walk out completely satisfied and at the same time all shook up.",Daily Beast,Malcolm Jones,04/02/2015
Skylight,9,Theater Review: An Illuminating Skylight,"And yet here they are in David Hare's Skylight, a monkey and a moonbeam, somehow bringing the same story to thrilling life. Nighy, as will be obvious to anyone who saw him in Love Actually or as Davy Jones in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, is the monkey, or perhaps better to call him a Catherine wheel of tics and poses and stutters and quirks. ""Mannered"" is not a strong enough word to describe the way he creates the illusion of character from a million incessant, if apparently spontaneous, affectations. (At several points, he struts across the stage sideways, his long legs pointing into the wings while his face stares down the audience.) Meanwhile, as she did in An Education and in the 2008 Broadway production The Seagull, Mulligan creates the illusion of character with no affectations at all. In fact, she hardly seems to be doing anything - and then suddenly tears will fling themselves from her eyes, or a smile will rise from some depth to the surface and recede again. She is as rivetingly, radically transparent as he is hilariously baroque, but in the end that's only fitting; the play, one of Hare's best, is about the gap between what's reconcilable and what's not.",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/02/2015
Skylight,8,"Review: ‘Skylight,’ With Carey Mulligan and Bill Nighy, Opens on Broadway","They are hardly a well-matched pair, this couple that has been given such transfixing life in two of the most expert stage performances you're likely to see for many seasons. As embodied by Carey Mulligan and Bill Nighy in the heart-piercing revival of David Hare's ""Skylight,"" Kyra Hollis and Tom Sergeant have none of the things in common that usually make for a fine romance...Yet as you watch Ms. Mulligan and Mr. Nighy move magnetically toward and away from each other in Stephen Daldry's exquisitely balanced London-born production...you can't help thinking that on some profound level these two were made to be together...The great achievement of this production from Mr. Daldry...is that it sustains each perspective with crystalline focus...As played by Ms. Mulligan...Kyra is obdurately calm and centered. But Ms. Mulligan achingly conveys just how hard-won this defensive stillness is. She has an uncommon gift for radiating complex layers of feeling by simply inhabiting a space. Mr. Nighy's Tom, in contrast, is a blinding kinetic force, a creature who never stops moving, advancing and retreating in a flurry of knife-edged angles, forever casing out and sizing up his environment.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,04/02/2015
Skylight,8,'Skylight': Theater Review,"...the three-decade age difference adds interesting layers to Kyra's daddy complex, and Nighy projects such unforced charm and wit that it's easy to imagine him seducing a smart, attractive girl in her twenties. The actor has a peerless way with Hare's caustic dialogue; he's magnetic in sardonic mode, when feigning indifference, in sputtering moments of rage, or letting down his guard to show his creeping desperation...Mulligan is more contained but no less commanding. She's watchful, controlled and wary, almost as if Kyra has played out this encounter many times in her head. And yet she's unable to deny a deep affection for Tom that lingers as undiminished as the hurt. If restless physicality and verbal dexterity are the signature traits of Nighy's performance, it's Mulligan's stillness and emotional transparency, battling with pride and anger, that distinguish her fine work, even navigating some of Hare's speechier passages with naturalness. Daldry has drawn three exquisite performances from his cast, and they lock together both in sharp contrast and in melancholy harmony with one another.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/02/2015
Skylight,8,"Broadway Review: ‘Skylight’ with Carey Mulligan, Bill Nighy","The fierce pas de deux of love and loss and anguish executed by Carey Mulligan and Bill Nighy in ""Skylight"" leaves you breathless -- and wondering how they can sustain this level of emotional intensity throughout the show's 13-week Broadway run. David Hare's 1995 drama, which floored West End audiences when director Stephen Daldry staged it last year with the same great cast, registers as a character-flaying study of ex-lovers whose lives and sensibilities have diverged since they parted. But deep down, it's a scathing censure of the Thatcher government's political legacy of social inequality and economic injustice...Whatever the takeaway for audiences hankering for a good political brawl, it's the tragic clash of human emotions that really stings.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,04/02/2015
Skylight,8,Skylight,"Society looms large in the Stephen Daldry's charged revival of David Hare's Skylight­...Bob Crowley's set...never lets you forget the wider world beyond Kyra's drab, barely heated flat. No matter how bitterly personal -- or airily abstract -- things get between these ex-lovers, you cannot ignore the unseen lives going on behind so many strangers' panes...Not to mislead: The piece is very much a nuanced relationship drama...the material is red meat to actors as fearless and deep-diving as Mulligan and Nighy. He's a haughty whirl of sharp elbow and legs scissoring out like a praying mantis; she balances his edgy antics with a convincingly warm, centered performance -- but one that hides great pain. There's an age difference between the characters, and a power imbalance, but the acting is beautifully matched (Matthew Beard is puckishly charming as Tom's concerned son). To invert a truism, strange bedfellows make politics -- and very interesting ones.",TimeOut NY,David Cote,04/02/2015
Skylight,8,"Jaded Lovers Reconnect in David Hare's ""Skylight""","The sharp writing has Kyra both peeling away Tom's many layers, and peeling onions -- the actress cooks spaghetti Bolognese during the first act, and the theater fills with the tangy smell of the sauce. Mulligan slices and dices as she deploys Hare's complex dialogue, accusing her ex-lover of trying to mask his guilt with exorbitant expenditures...Mulligan makes cooking while acting seem easy; it can't be. Nighy, reprising a role he first played in 1997, is excellent at portraying his irritation with his surroundings, eyeing an unappealing morsel of cheese Kyra has asked him to grate as if it were a personal affront...Nighy's performance is full of that nervous energy that makes him so much fun to watch...Bob Crowley's set captures the anonymous feel of the freezing council flat, with a transparent wall that allows the audience to see beyond to the next set of soulless apartments. The design underscores the very different realities that Kyra and Tom, once inseparable, live in now -- ""Skylight"" leaves you with the feeling there's no going back for either of them.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,04/02/2015
Skylight,8,Review: 'Skylight' on Broadway is funny and poignant,"Mulligan, in a crackling revival of David Hare's ""Skylight"" that opened Thursday at the Golden Theater, starts and completes a spaghetti Bolognese during the first act, chopping onions and garlic and boiling water along the way. The whiff of sausage lingers deliciously during intermission. It's a fitting theatrical device because this show, quite simply, cooks. Mulligan, a spectacular Bill Nighy, the marvelous newcomer Matthew Beard and the director Stephen Daldry make alchemy onstage with their own red-hot talent.

Skylight,7,Carey Mulligan and Bill Nighy are a mismatched couple in ‘Skylight’,"Watching a couple duke it out works only if you also understand what drew them to each other in the first place. But in the new Broadway revival of David Hare's ""Skylight,"" the lovers don't share much, either in love or war...The imbalance of power between them is a key part of the play, and much of that is due to their age difference...But in this production, directed by Stephen Daldry (""The Audience""), the gap has turned into a chasm: There's no getting around the fact that Mulligan is 29 to Nighy's 65...The lack of sexual chemistry between them makes you wonder why Kyra bothers to put up with Tom. It doesn't help that Nighy, who first played the role in 1997, turns on the charm so hard that all we see are mannered tics. In contrast, Mulligan is a marvel of quiet strength...she truly comes alive onstage.

Hughie,8,Forest Whitaker successfully tackles Eugene O’Neill’s ‘Hughie’,"In Whitaker's eager-to-please though slightly pushy manner, Erie comes across as one of those fellows whose need to disclose overwhelms your ability to retreat. The intermittent nervous giggle betrays a soul of deeper insecurities than he otherwise cares to expose. And yet Erie can't help but reveal the truth of his situation, the losses and rejections he's racked up.

Hughie,8,"Review: Broadway's Odd 'Hughie' Glows, Thanks to Whitaker","Smoke effects, Adam Cork's ghostly music, which fills a few long pauses, and the rumblings of the busy street outside give this ""Hughie"" a spectral, slightly macabre feel. It has the effect of making these two men more meaningful and of deepening the meaning of the play. Whitaker's confidence grows as his Erie becomes comfortable around the new night clerk. As he gets looser and more animated, the actor also shows the gnawing loneliness of Erie, his disgust and also the respect he shared with Hughie...Whitaker handles the overripe dialogue...without overplaying it, and adds nervous touches...One of the pleasures of reading O'Neill's script is the extended interior thoughts of the night clerk, which somehow Wood must translate onstage beyond a general sullenness...Wood is perfectly clipped and standoffish...Grandage lets it breathe and the actors make it work as a parable about connecting and disconnecting in modern life.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,02/25/2016

This is not to suggest that Mr. Whitaker is low on stage presence. But instead of cranking up the heat and the volume in the way you associate with barnstorming star turns, he gives the impression of someone who always feels the tug of invisibility, of nothingness.

With his sleepy eyes, soulful voice and fluttering hands, Whitaker is a superb actor who can wear sorrow like a baggy overcoat.

You're more likely to remember the gorgeous set: the darkened lobby of a ghostly hotel, dominated by a steep, foreboding staircase. Michael Grandage's direction emphasizes a spooky atmosphere that makes you wonder if the characters -- Frank Wood plays the other, mostly silent, one -- are dead and in some kind of purgatory.",NY Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,02/25/2016
Hughie,6,Forest Whitaker Spins Tall Tales Of Sex And Money In Broadway’s ‘Hughie’ Revival – Review,"Forest Whitaker plays Erie, whose ensuing near-monologue takes up most of Eugene O'Neill's brief one-act drama of a man whose fragile delusions crack and turn to dust under the stolid gaze of an indifferent stranger. It's a brave, if odd, choice for a Broadway debut, this meager work that reads better than it plays...The biggest miscue of Michael Grandage's production (whether the choice is the director's or the star's, it's impossible to know) is that Erie seems to believe his bullshit. He lacks the sense of desperation that O'Neill says will overcome Erie during the course of this dark hour...There is no sense of the growing panic that will lead to Erie's final revelation about his loss of confidence after Hughie's death...The result is a failure to lift this small work into the tragic realm to which it aspires. It remains stubbornly small. That's surely as much O'Neill's fault as Whitaker's. But it's Whitaker we've come to see.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,02/25/2016

This is especially problematic given that this one-act play is essentially a monologue delivered by Whitaker's character...for any of this to work, ""Hughie"" requires a lead actor who can bring to Erie's mythmaking and self-aggrandizement to life; someone who can show us a man who is both pitiful yet also poignantly noble.

Hughie,6,Forest Whitaker makes a powerful Broadway debut in Hughie,"Whitaker must make sure that, unlike Eerie's audience of the lone night clerk (played by Frank Wood, perfecting an eyes-open narcolepsy), we are not bored to stupefaction. Instead, he must be sufficiently magnetic and compelling in his patter that we, the real audience, never want him to shut up...Also, the grandstanding here has to be the opposite kind of Amin's: that of a man who, deep down, knows he holds next to no power. Accordingly, Whitaker imbues Eerie's showboating with impressive understatement...it's curious that Grandage would have chosen to intersperse the play with several heavy-handed interludes in which the lights intensify, the spooky music swells and the clerk's stare becomes even more eerily vacant. Perhaps these moments are simply there for Whitaker to catch his breath.",Telegraph,Hermione Hoby,02/25/2016

Hughie,6,BWW Review: Forest Whitaker Undistinguished in a Handsomely Designed HUGHIE,"The play is essentially a monologue for Erie, as he tries making buddies with the new, disinterested night clerk in an attempt to change his luck...Sadly, Whitaker's performance is far too undistinguished...Under Michael Grandage's direction, he's a rather ordinary, friendly presence, who continually speaks in a repetitive sing-songy rhythm. There's little depth, or even vocal variety in his portrayal and the proceedings get dull quickly. It would be unfair to say that Wood steals the show with his tiny role, but his fine, understated turn is a lovely display of a stage actor's craft.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,02/25/2016
Hughie,6,Hughie,"Yes, the accomplished film star is listed in the program and speaks Erie's lines, but he misses the spirit of the character, leaving an unmistakable void not to be confused with the playwright's poetic nihilism...A lot goes well: Frank Wood provides able support as a new night clerk...Wood's role is tricky, requiring long stretches of deadpan stillness and barely active listening, but he fills it well. The physical production - sleekly directed by Michael Grandage - is grimly gorgeous to a fault...We get it: Erie is a damned soul in torment - but Whitaker portrays him as a low-status, apologetic schlemiel who's already given up. When he should be a big-talking con man and Runyonesque swell, Whitaker tries something possibly more realistic, but ends up blunting O'Neill's punchy lines...as we wait for Whitaker to gain confidence in his character, the night grows long and weary.",TimeOut NY,David Cote,02/25/2016
Hughie,6,Whitaker Rolls the Dice on O'Neill Drama for Broadway Debut,"The likable actor, an Oscar winner for ""The Last King of Scotland,"" is brave to spread his wings to Broadway, but his performance, at least for now, is disappointingly one-note...Whitaker, north of 6-feet-tall, manages to slouch and slink into the role. He plays Erie as consistently content, but such joviality doesn't seem to fit the circumstances...There must be a deep unhappiness and loneliness within him; we just aren't seeing it. Whitaker delivers his dialogue in an oddly staccato style. Maybe he's still trying to find his footing with O'Neill's rhythms. Wood's challenge, as the new clerk, is to react professionally, even though he'd rather not engage in mindless chatter...Wood does a remarkable job radiating detachment.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,02/25/2016
Hughie,5,Aisle View: A Long Night's Journey and a Police Story,"The Academy Award-winning actor Forest Whitaker...is an actor we want to see and who's work we want to see. Unfortunately, he is now at the Booth playing Eugene O'Neill's stemwinding character Erie Smith, a character he hasn't been able to crack...Hughie--as the playwright suspected--is not quite workable as a stage piece. A character study, and a rich one; but not a satisfying play...Whitaker appears to have the thing properly memorized, and has developed something of the swagger of a washed-up small-time gambler. His rendition of Erie Smith, however, never begins to come alive.",Huffington Post,Steven Suskin,02/25/2016
Hughie,5,Theater Reviews: A Miscast Hughie and a Cheesy-Fun Pericles,"Whitaker is a fine film actor who has brought method intensity and authenticity to a variety of highly dramatic characters, from Charlie Parker to Idi Amin. But the method technique isn't a good match for Hughie, even if Al Pacino made a success of Erie on Broadway in 1996. The role requires not just the deep dive into personality that the Method suggests but the huckster tricks and verbal animation of a true stage animal. (The original Broadway Erie, in 1964, was Jason Robards.) Whitaker is so interiorized he seems catatonic, with peculiar diction, a strange accent (""dolls"" is rendered as ""dawls""), and a way of chopping up sentences that suggests he has only a tentative grip on the lines. He moves well, which is to say idiosyncratically, with a rolling gait and a charadeslike intensity of hand movement that might well make the characterization visible if it weren't so inaudible. Even so, you spend a lot of the time looking at Wood, a theatrical creature through and through, doing much more with much less.",Vulture,Jesse Green,02/25/2016
Hughie,2,Theater review: Forest Whitaker makes Broadway debut in Eugene O'Neill's 'Hughie',"This ""Hughie"" is hooey. It's not that Forest Whitaker's acting is bad in this high-profile revival. It's that this likeable Oscar winner is not doing any discernible acting to speak of...Whitaker...is simply reciting his lines rather than embodying Erie Smith...Whitaker offers was no connection or depth. That's a shame, since there's plenty to play as Erie, who's down on his luck and living on illusions...Director Michael Grandage...comes up short with a production that lacks high points...Christopher Oram's scenic design is an unqualified success...If you tire of Whitaker's disconnected talk, gaze at the faded tin ceiling or the broken elevator. They're subtle signs of former glory.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,02/25/2016
A Delicate Balance,9,Review: Edward Albee's 'A Delicate Balance' on Broadway with Glenn Close still a strong brew,"Albee's 1967 Pulitzer Prize-winner, which takes an upper class, suburban WASP family to the breaking point over a weekend, is superbly directed by Pam MacKinnon and so well performed by a trans-Atlantic ensemble that each actor manages to convince you that they are the focus of the show...Albee has clearly found a soul mate in the examination of how life gets compromised and calcified. MacKinnon has an equally blistering cast this time, with Lithgow as a terribly good ineffective peacemaker, trying to avoid verbal land mines, counseling ""let it be,"" and constantly fetching drinks. His story about an old house cat becomes an aria and his eventual collapse into a barking puddle of honesty is gorgeous. Close's Agnes perfectly navigates the role's twin dangers of barking self-righteousness, on the one hand, and nasty bitchiness on the other. She's able to switch from soft and loving to arch and noble to pounce like an alley cat.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,11/20/2014
A Delicate Balance,9,Review: Glenn Close Tips the Scales in “A Delicate Balance”,"""A Delicate Balance"" proves to be the perfect vehicle for Close...On the surface, Agnes seems like an easy role to play -- a cold, emotionless monster who always appears to be in control. But Close paints a much more complex portrait. Her Agnes is a woman carrying layers of sadness and loss under that strength; A woman who allows herself to breathe through humor and love. It's a transfixing performance. Understated, yet the glue that holds everyone together. And Albee's words -- often presented in long, compound, poignant paragraphs -- will sound like pure poetry coming out of Close's mouth...Lithgow never lets us think that Tobias is a fool. He's just walked away from the battlefield. And when Tobias eventually returns to the fight in a pivotal scene in the play's third act, Lithgow leaves him raw, exposed and completely defenseless. MacKinnon, who won a Tony for directing the 2012 revival of Albee's ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,"" guides these greats through the author's lengthy literature wisely, striking her own delicate balance between pacing and performance.",NBC New York,Dave Quinn,11/20/2014
A Delicate Balance,9,Stars juggle stormy emotions in 'Delicate Balance',"There are few things more terrifying than a calm Glenn Close...Agnes, who sees it as her task to maintain order, never entirely loses her cool. But in Close's revelatory performance, she evolves from a woman who seems almost preternaturally composed -- even as she contemplates going mad, in her first lines -- to a more intimidating and sadder creature striving desperately for ""maintenance,"" as she puts it...MacKinnon certainly doesn't shy away from Balance's absurdist leanings...Tobias and Agnes and their decades of baggage are central throughout, of course, and MacKinnon and her actors make it abundantly clear that this marriage is not a loveless one. The tenderness and regret in Lithgow's expression as Tobias looks at his wife, and the barely repressed agony Close brings to some lines, convey something greater than tolerance or co-dependence. These fine actors find the warmth in Albee's stinging message. It's a pleasure to see them in roles that accommodate both their intensity and their flair for nuance.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,11/20/2014
A Delicate Balance,9,"Theater Review: A Delicate Balance, Still Necessary and Brilliant","To begin with, A Delicate Balance is a masterpiece...Albee manages to keep the sadness, the mystery, and the ruthlessness in dynamic equilibrium, tipping this way and that but never crashing...Each fury, and there are many, is perfectly faceted and then rotated to capture different angles of the light...Luckily it is piercingly clear at the center. The question of what Agnes and Tobias should do about their best friends' need for succor grows quickly horrific after its hilarious introduction. This turn is partly the result of very fine work from Bob Balaban, and especially Clare Higgins, as Harry and Edna, who keep, yes, a delicate balance between the absurdity of their blandness and the primal terror of their plight. To watch Higgins flip from pitiful tears to snappish moralizing, both of them genuine, in a few lines of dialogue is to watch real character being built in real time. If neither Martha Plimpton as Julia nor Lindsay Duncan as Claire reaches quite the same extremes of inhabitation, they are both fine in difficult roles...It's enough to be in the presence of these words again. That they indict even as they tickle makes their pleasure more satisfying.",Vulture,Jesse Green,11/20/2014
A Delicate Balance,9,Broadway: Glenn Close and Cast Strike “A Delicate Balance” on Roughest Critics Night Ever,", : I will tell you now that you can't miss these performances -- including British actress Clare Higgins. Albee's play is a masterpiece and this group conveys it very well. There is some shaky direction by Pam McKinnon...Albee's play about family, friendship, love, and loss is devastating. ""Balance"" maintains its own balance as a conventional drawing room comedy of manners that becomes an existential jigsaw puzzle. Close and Lithgow have an amazing rapport, as do Balaban and Higgins. Martha Plimpton gives it all heft as the voice of reason. The amazing Lindsay Duncan is there for upheaval, and for playing the accordion. I wish she did more on Broadway.",Showbiz411,Roger Friedman,11/20/2014
A Delicate Balance,8,Broadway Review: ‘A Delicate Balance’ With Glenn Close and John Lithgow,"""A Delicate Balance"" is no play for sissies...All these years later, it's still very disturbing to look this work in the eye...Close, with her fine bones, imperial manner and elegant wardrobe (by Ann Roth), is positively regal as Agnes...Although Agnes admits to the all-too-human fear of losing her marbles and becoming ""mad as a hatter,"" she'll brook no challenge to her authority from husband Tobias, played in Lithgow's carefully calibrated perf as a worm of a man -- but a worm who will eventually turn and deliver a blistering reckoning of the family's alienation from the living...It takes guts to take on a role famously played by Marian Seldes in the original production and by Elaine Stritch in the 1996 Broadway revival. So hats off to Duncan for the devilish joy she takes in the spiteful humor of that social rebel, a colorful scandal to the whole family, but a real menace to her sister's domination of the household.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,11/20/2014
A Delicate Balance,8,'A Delicate Balance': Theater Review,"What impresses arguably even more than the performances, however, is the structural brilliance of Albee's writing...Close's Agnes is all glacial poise, with articulate language to match. She rarely raises her voice above a genteel coo, even when speculating almost wistfully about the prospect of a retreat into madness...Despite his nominal position as patriarch, Tobias is a weaker specimen than either his wife or sister-in-law, and the key choices of his adult life have been about insulating himself from the truth. His tumble down the treacherous well of self-knowledge makes him the most affecting character, and Lithgow's performance is tremendous as Tobias releases years of pent-up anguish...There are piercing moments of pathos in all the performances...The director's blocking is impeccable, firmly delineating both the reaffirmations of power and the challenges to it...Both harsh and heartwrenching, this is a needling play that's of its time and yet still surging with post-modern vitality. Its dialogue and characters border on arch but are ineffably human.",The Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,11/20/2014
A Delicate Balance,8,A Delicate Balance,"...if you don't let in this desolating, resonant piece (via brain or heart), it might indeed seem little else than two talky hours...A stony stare at varieties of moral vacancy, the play itself is full to bursting...I never saw the 1996 Lincoln Center revival, which reportedly struck a more realistic tone. But Pam MacKinnon directs this solid revival with a keen ear for the curling, teasing rhythms of Albee's ornate lines, and the performances are top-notch, including the perfectly deadpan Balaban and a sinister Higgins as the unwelcome guests. Martha Plimpton finds sympathetic notes in the difficult, shrill role of Julia, and Close and Lithgow handle their tricky speeches with grace and nuance. If Close is a touch too frosty, she's thawed by Lithgow's warmth.",Time Out NY,David Cote,11/20/2014
A Delicate Balance,8,"‘A Delicate Balance,’ theater review","Albee's title applies to virtually any scenario. But Agnes and Toby are keenly concerned with the delicate balance of keeping reality -- or anything, or anyone, unpleasant -- outside their front door...Agnes is tightly wrapped, in terms of both manner and costume, which smartly underscores the sense of insularity. Close, with her aristocratic take on Agnes, comes within inches of coming off as arch. That approach doesn't hurt the character. But Close's unintentional habit of tripping over Albee's dialogue doesn't help. Lithgow, meantime, is riveting every moment he's on stage -- which is a lot -- even when Tobias is silent. As he takes the character from quiet restraint to explosive urgency, he doesn't miss a beat and never for a second loses his equilibrium. His is a delicate -- and distinctive -- balance.",New York Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,11/20/2014
A Delicate Balance,8,BROADWAY REVIEW: 'A Delicate Balance' at Golden Theatre,"Albee likes his works to be directed by MacKinnon because, I think, she makes no attempt to amplify the angst, but concentrates instead on total veracity in primary colors and on turning her actors -- no small feat here -- into an ensemble of interdependent players...Close, returning to Broadway after many years away, will need more time to fully lubricate her considerable skills in this kind of stage-savvy company, although a note of self-consciousness is hardly inapt for Agnes, and Close is always true. But with Lithgow, everything is always in play. Right now. As Tobias, Lithgow's colors are as ample as his fellow's growing understanding that a drink cart is about all that separates a well-appointed home from an elevator, going down...This is, to say the least, a pleasurable three acts of watching others teeter on the brink, which always helps you last another day on terra firma yourself.

A Delicate Balance,7,An Albee Revival Tries Again,"At its best, it's thought-provoking and sometimes challenging, but it takes a long time to get moving, and I wonder whether modern-day audiences will be willing to wait for it...While the notion that well-to-do WASPs are dead inside is perhaps the least little bit overfamiliar, this is still a fairly promising setup for a theater-of-the-absurd comedy...""A Delicate Balance"" comes across like a dramatically static rewrite of ""Virginia Woolf"" with rather less drinking and much less cursing...Pam MacKinnon, who staged last year's outstanding Broadway revival of ""Virginia Woolf,"" is Mr. Albee's preferred director, so we can assume that this direct, unmannered production is what the author had in mind...Ms. Close's performance is quiet, tasteful and underprojected, not surprising for an actor who has been absent from the stage for so long. Mr. Lithgow, by contrast, is in extraordinary form, by turns tightly inhibited and almost shockingly anguished.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,11/20/2014
A Delicate Balance,7,Theater review: 'A Delicate Balance',": ""A Delicate Balance"" is a long play, and, particularly in Agnes' lengthy speeches, it can slow down, and become gloomy.

A Delicate Balance,7,'Delicate Balance' teeters slightly but always fascinates,": Director Pam MacKinnon...has paid exquisite attention to surface detail in her handsome revival...The work is overextended, not always dramatically convincing and sometimes too knowingly articulated. Yet there's something intriguing about its puzzling mix of realism and absurdism, which are ultimately reconciled in the dazzling display of Albee's fearless theatricality...This is an ensemble effort...The performances are all sharp -- Higgins' Edna is especially crisp -- but they're still coalescing. This is the kind of work that will deepen over time. As Agnes...Close is all patrician glamour and icy control...Her portrayal reveals the heavy burden Agnes has been carrying of keeping her family -- and her own psyche -- intact...Lithgow movingly depicts the panicked struggle of a man who realizes that he's in danger of being buried alive...If this production of ""A Delicate Balance"" teeters unsteadily at moments, it remains always fascinating to behold.

A Delicate Balance,7,Towering John Lithgow Dominates ‘Delicate Balance’ Revival On Broadway,"A storm rages at the center of the Broadway revival of Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance. Though camouflaged in the elegant, comfortable mufti of the affluent upper classes, it's leveling everyone in its wake while leaving the building intact, like a neutron bomb. Its name is John Lithgow...surveying it all, tolerating it all, the affable Tobias of John Lithgow smolders, bursts into flame and slowly grows cold. It's as rich a performance as I've ever seen, the achievement of a lifetime spent commuting brilliantly between New York stages and Hollywood screens of every size...Nothing in Pam MacKinnon's finely calibrated but emotionally uneven and infrequently unnerving staging measures up to the sheer power of either Albee's dramaturgy or Lithgow's inhabitance of Tobias. There is no better interpreter of Albee today; her revival of Virginia Woolf was nothing less than a revelation, in part because its ensemble was perfectly knit. Such unity is absent here in a stellar cast that nevertheless seems mismatched.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,11/20/2014
A Delicate Balance,7,A Delicate Balance review – Close and Lithgow share cocktails and threats,"In A Delicate Balance, an ominous domestic drama of 1966 now revived on Broadway, there's hardly a sentence that isn't meant to scratch or slice or slash...The director, Pam MacKinnon, who superintended the most recent and rather dazzling revival of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, works to ground these seemingly extraordinary events and to temper Albee's penchant for absurdism with a realistic emotional palette...Despite the exertions of director and cast, the play can feel long and talky and the audience was not without its snoozers. Yet nearly half a century on, it hasn't really dated. The sense of menace and threat that underlies the chat - the tenuousness of even the most settled lives - remains immediate and disturbing. Like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (if unlike The Zoo Story), a lot threatens to happen, but not much does....",The Guardian,Alexis Soloski,11/20/2014
A Delicate Balance,6,Pretty Crowded for an Empty Nest,"Hope arrives in the form of dread toward the end of the first act of Edward Albee's ""A Delicate Balance""...Up to that point in this production, directed by Pam MacKinnon, it's been hard to detect much feeling of any kind within the carefully color-coordinated, dust-free, energy-free environs that have been installed onstage. To be sure, the three talented and celebrated people we have been watching up there thus far -- Glenn Close, John Lithgow and Lindsay Duncan -- have been delivering their characters' zingers and stingers with crispness, clarity and, when one feels an important theme coming on, heavy italics. Yet they have the distant, flattened dimensions of specimens under glass...But then -- oh, sweet deliverance -- here come good old, miserable, intrusive Harry and Edna to shake things up...As embodied by Bob Balaban and Clare Higgins, Harry and Edna arrive like a gust of -- well, I was going to say fresh air, but what Harry and Edna bring with them is something noxious and polluted...Their acting is more subtle than anybody else's here, but it is also bone deep...Yet in this version of ""A Delicate Balance,"" there is no underneath. Its stars speak the lines as if they -- I mean, the performers, not the characters -- know exactly what they're saying and why...As you would expect of these highly accomplished, multi-award-winning cast members, none of them are bad.

A Delicate Balance,6,"'A Delicate Balance' review: Great Edward Albee, tepid production","...although the play still dazzles with wit, gorgeous writing and the lurking terror of mortality, we miss the accumulating shock he gave to the characters' lives of cozy self-satisfaction. Director Pam MacKinnon...spells things out here instead of letting Albee toy with us through suggestion and suspense...Albee...challenges actors with tyrannical syntactic demands -- mouthfuls of polysyllabic, unforgiving, grown-up paragraphs that require virtuosos to make them sound like speech. Lithgow is droll and manor-born as the retired Tobias, though we never believe he is as ineffectual as Agnes claims. Oddly, Close, who has three best-actress Tonys, seemed daunted at a recent preview by Agnes' exhilarating but Olympian monologues. Stumbling over the words is a special problem for a silver fox who fancies herself the fulcrum of the family's equilibrium...instead of upsetting the balance of self-satisfied old money, the scene screams ostentation. Nothing, alas, is delicate.",Newsday,Linda Winer,11/20/2014
A Delicate Balance,6,A Delicate Balance (2014),"MacKinnon's feisty if occasionally restless revival...makes intriguing work of Albee's portrait of WASPy retired couple Agnes and Tobias (Close and Lithgow) contemplating family and friendship in the final act of their lives...The production can feel like it's oscillating speeds, but the constant is shimmering character work, and why wouldn't you expect that from such a cast of heavy-hitters? In her first leading Broadway appearance since 1994's Sunset Boulevard, Glenn Close makes a comfy return to the stage as the self-important Agnes, whose self-pity is as dramatic as her pashminas. Close exudes the kind of veteran flair and magnetism you'd presume from such a marquee name. But although this seems to be Close's marquee, it's John Lithgow who runs away with the show. As insular dilemmas pile on for the pensive, settled Tobias, Lithgow offers a tremendous master class in the art of the slow burn, cautiously placing weight on Tobias until he hits his emotional tipping point with touching resonance.

A Delicate Balance,6,‘A Delicate Balance’ Theater Review: Glenn Close Revisits More Than One Diva,"At least Glenn Close is entertaining and fun to watch in the new, blunt revival of Edward Albee's ""A Delicate Balance""...Close has this way of turning her black-button eyes into tiny holes that don't so much see out as burrow their way into her skull...Her performance is also why this ""Delicate Balance,"" directed by Pam Mackinnon, is blunt and unsubtle. And turning Agnes into an uncompromising gargoyle is only part of the monochromatic scheme at work here. Not entertaining and fun are Plimpton's merely loud Julia and Duncan's monotonous Claire, a performance that exposes a serious flaw in Albee's play: Claire, besides being clairvoyant and delivering a few amusing wisecracks, serves no function in act three...Back in the 1960s, Albee was accused of turning his female characters into harridans. Mackinnon's work with these three actresses, unfortunately, makes that case...Lithgow and Balaban give some semblance of playing human beings. Lithgow's delivery of Tobias' famous cat speech is especially multi-faceted.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,11/20/2014
A Delicate Balance,4,Glenn Close and John Lithgow too restrained in ‘Delicate Balance’,"This new ""A Delicate Balance"" is like a Christmas fruitcake that's been left out too long: It's boozy and loaded with goodies -- Glenn Close! John Lithgow! -- but it's also on the dry side. The booze you can almost taste because Edward Albee's characters are constantly liquoring up, probably to make up for their boredom. It's a feeling you too may share during Pam MacKinnon's bloodless production. She did a much better job with ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" two years ago...As the play turns to the absurd, Albee's writing brims with black humor and red-hot loathing. The show, by contrast, is a benign beige. Lithgow is best when Tobias is playing along with the women in his life, but his big letting-it-all-out scene feels forced. And Close's one-note, tight-lipped performance keeps the audience at arms' length, the way Agnes distances herself from family and friends. A delicate balance? By the end of Act 3, it might refer to the one between wakefulness and sleep.",New York Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,11/20/2014
A Delicate Balance,4,‘A Delicate Balance’ falls flat,"When you put a bunch of great actors together...and get them to perform a Pulitzer-winning drama (by no less than Edward Albee), you expect fireworks. But the starry new Broadway revival of Albee's 1966 drama ""A Delicate Balance"" is surprisingly flat and likely to disappoint both those unfamiliar with the three-act play, as well as those who still remember its much acclaimed revival from two decades ago with Elaine Stritch and Rosemary Harris...Despite the witty lines and a handful of exciting moments, the production is a three-hour, very static bore. Pam MacKinnon, who directed the 2012 Broadway revival of Albee's ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", never manages to combine these accomplished performers into a unified ensemble.

A View from the Bridge,7,‘A View From the Bridge’ Review: Troubled Waters of Self-Regard,"The actors walk around barefoot for no apparent reason, accompanied by snippets of the Fauré Requiem that are played on an endless loop, with a drum tapping at maddeningly metronomic intervals to signify...what? Only, it seems, that Mr. Van Hove is so determined to put his personal stamp on ""A View From the Bridge"" that he doesn't seem to care whether any of his over-familiar avant-garde tricks are organically related to the script. Instead, they're poured over it like a rancid sauce. What I find most puzzling about Mr. Van Hove's method is that when you scrape away the sauce of self-regard, what you find underneath...is a staging that gets to the point of Miller's play with near-naturalistic directness. Not only does he move actors around fluidly, but he also knows how to pick them: Mark Strong is simple and forceful as Eddie Carbone...Unfortunately, [Van Hove] neither trusts them nor the play, which is pretentious in its own way...but can be shatteringly effective when done well.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,11/12/2015
A View from the Bridge,7,‘A View From The Bridge’ Brings A Bloodbath To Broadway – Review,"I have to admit I'm of two minds about Van Hove's A View From the Bridge. My 30-year-old critic self probably would have thrilled to the ballsiness of turning a naturalistic melodrama into a Greek tragedy. Doing so adds a layer of meaning the way the cover of Abbey Road added a layer of meaning to the Beatles mythology. But my older-critic self says, ""Leave the damned play alone."" Leave us to draw the connection from Eddie Carbone to Willie Loman (Death Of A Salesman) and Joe Keller (All My Sons) - men whose sense of their own manhood cannot survive the emasculating pressures of making it in America. In the end, Eddie impotently demands his ""respect"" - even though he's committed the ultimate crime of ratting out his countrymen to Immigration. Even sexual congress with Catherine would have been more forgivable than that. Eddie's tragedy, like Willy's and Joe's, is that he is no hero at all, but a victim not only of his own tortured desire (perhaps it's Rodolpho he really wants?) but of his inability to gain entree to that American Dream he's been sold on.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,11/12/2015
A View from the Bridge,7,"Theater Review: Miller Made Minimal by Ivo van Hove, in A View From the Bridge","What makes this slight misfit of play and production finally unimportant is that the actors are so devastatingly good. Their habit of fealty to character as defined by dialogue survives the director's effacements. Mark Strong may be styled to look like a neutral Everyman of the past or future, but, in his bearing and cadence and anguish and bafflement, he is only Red Hook's Eddie Carbone, in full tragic tilt. Phoebe Fox makes Catherine's transition from baby doll to furious womanhood thrillingly transparent, just as Nicola Walker, as Eddie's wife, Beatrice, shows how every hopeful choice she and Eddie have made now closes in on her like a trap. (For once, Beatrice and Catherine actually look like aunt and niece.) The Italian brothers, Marco (Michael Zegen) and Rodolpho (Russell Tovey), are both excellent in difficult roles, and Michael Gould makes of Alfieri the perfectly regretful guide. Some of the credit for the cast's superb work obviously belongs to van Hove; he knew he needed actors who could stand up to his powerful, showy interventions. It's a fair trade; those interventions probably made this revival viable. Still, one looks on them, and on van Hove's upcoming Broadway production of The ­Crucible with, as Alfieri says, ""a certain alarm.""",Vulture,Jesse Green,11/12/2015

There are no props, and curiously the actors wear no shoes. Lending to the strange, anxious atmosphere is an underscore of murmurous music that is heard throughout the show. The result is alternately powerful and a wee bit ridiculous. The power comes mostly courtesy of an astonishing lead performance by British actor Mark Strong (""Sherlock Holmes,"" ""The Imitation Game""), who takes a nearly impossible-to-play character...and transforms him into a viscerally flesh-and-blood, palpably tortured figure...Alas, this ""A View from the Bridge""...doesn't quite cohere...a touch more humor and humility might have gone a very long way.

It is most effective at the play's brutal climax, which also contains a splashy visual feat. Mark Strong conveys Eddie's inner torment with a quiet intensity...For the record, this production received big raves in London, and I'm sure that many people here will be similarly turned on by it.

Maroulis... fully unleashes his powerful pipes in the dual roles of the mild-mannered scientist and his rampaging, id-driven alter-ego.

Moreover, this production has the extra-special disadvantage of starring Constantine Maroulis, lately of ""American Idol"" and ""Rock of Ages."" Mr. Maroulis has absolutely no business playing a romantic lead in a Broadway musical. His singing is whiny and insipid, while his acting recalls what Somerset Maugham is supposed to have said when he visited the set of the 1941 film version of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" and saw Spencer Tracy thrashing through a scene: ""Which one is he now?""

Both actresses are impeccable, funny and affecting...Inevitably, love complicates matters. If you think relationships are hard, try having one with a conjoined twin...Even after all the surgery, ""Side Show"" is far from a great musical. The second act piles on heavy-handed calls for tolerance. The production's also handicapped by the blandness of Silverman and Hydzik, who have matinee-idol good looks but little acting depth. Yet this show also has a strange, slightly demented charm, especially in the vaudeville and carnival scenes.

As played by Erin Davie and Emily Padgett, their charms and clear talents notwithstanding, the twins Violet and Daisy Hilton are too much alike. And thus they're too much of a wash for the show to have the requisite fire...Violet and Daisy must learn to accept their lot, as we all must do, to change what they can and accept what they cannot.

Instead, this show looks too often toward its own ending...Condon's work is atmospheric and, occasionally, has some richness...The freakishness of ""Side Show"" has to be as real as the desires of the human exhibit with two bodies, two personalties, two sets of desires and yet only one vehicle for mutual delivery.

The musical has been extensively rewritten, with many new songs, richer side characters and a clearer let-your-Freaks-flag-fly message. Emily Padgett (as the stardom-eyed Daisy) and Erin Davie (as the shrinking Violet) work marvelously together, achieving both the requisite synchronicity and the trickier discreteness of personality. Ryan Silverman, Matthew Hydzik and the iron-voiced David St. Louis are impressive as their side men, and some scenes are genuinely moving. But while this sincere and stylishly designed production is perhaps the best that Side Show can be, that best, alas, isn't great.

Par for the course, the tale of two long-forgotten curios zips along quickly but feels like a lot is missing -- and what's here is sanitized...We take a journey with these dreamgirls, but there's no truly satisfying payoff -- or a portrait that goes deeper than the skin.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,11/17/2014

Side Show,6,Theater Review: The Dual Nature of Side Show,"Despite what seemed like weeks of buzz about its radical transformations, the revival of Side Show that opened on Broadway tonight is not as meaningfully different from the 1997 original as its current creatives would like to think. Now as then, the cult musical about the conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton is itself conjoined. (There's no avoiding the Siamese imagery; many of the songs, and even the title, play on the theme.) The story of the Hiltons' rise from circus freaks to vaudeville stars in the early 1930s, with all the requisite references to cultural voyeurism and its human costs, is fused to an intimate story of emotional accommodation between sisters as unalike as sisters can be. The problem with Side Show is that these stories can't be separated, and only one can thrive.",Vulture,Jesse Green,11/17/2014

They merely seemed like two women who just happened to be standing very close to each other. I don't know why. Having heard repeatedly about the magical symbiotic performances of Ripley and Skinner, I was eagerly looking forward to what Davie and Padgett would do.

Its cast of accomplished actors scurries on and off the stage in a continuous blur of dramatic inertia and purposelessness, with very little sense of who they are and even less cohesion. What's missing, primarily, is the fundamental element of pathos. When Chekhov cast his gaze over turn of the 20th century Russia and its chilly winds of socio-economic change, he spread his sympathies with admirable even-handedness between the doomed aristocracy, clinging with stubborn blindness to its obsolete status, and the former servant class, grappling with its newfound prospects for wealth and elevation.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,10/16/2016

The problem, even with serious interpretive artists at the helm, is that everyone must be seeking to serve in the same way. Here that does not appear to be the case. The adaptation, by Stephen Karam, is clean and mostly neutral, with an occasional bit of contemporary vernacular (""Get out!"" where fustier translations offer something like ""Think of that!"") deliberately jarring the ear. I say deliberately because the staging by Simon Godwin, an associate director at London's National Theatre now making his New York debut, also underlines the modernity of Chekhov's themes, but does so rather more academically and urgently.",Vulture,Jesse Green,10/16/2016

In its first incarnation “Annie” was an unstoppable sunshine steamroller. This version, which flirts with shadows, moves more shakily…In 1977 Miss Hannigan was portrayed by Dorothy Loudon as a juicy gargoyle, with equal parts Dickensian villainy and showbiz oomph. Ms. Finneran, a two-time Tony winner, takes a more humanizing approach…As Warbucks...Anthony Warlow also ventures into naturalism, inflecting his songs with unexpected emotional variety...The delicate-featured but indefatigable Ms. Crawford, who is possessed of both a golden glow and a voice of brass, is pretty close to perfect in the title role.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,11/08/2012

In fact, she does very little new...If Finneran is big and brassy and broad, Warlow is the opposite.

Both stars play to their strengths in Leonard Foglia's beautifully paced production. Jones makes wonderful use of Weller's superior size and strength to bully and bluster his way through every contested hand, while Tyson's priceless skills in the gentle art of passive aggression make the oh-so-delicate Fonsia a fierce and formidable opponent.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,10/14/2015

Despite being a little hunched with age, Weller remains a fearsome bear of a man in Jones' well-honed characterization, using his thunderous basso voice to stifle any uncomfortable small talk or implied criticism...Tyson is tiny and birdlike, affecting a butter-wouldn't-melt innocence and a vise-like handbag grip...But this sweet, shuffling figure turns out to be quite passive-aggressive, revealing her barely disguised glee each time she humiliates Weller by piercing his masculine pride.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,10/14/2015

Tyson, in fuzzy light brown curls and an omnipresent handbag, has a simplicity that makes everything look easy.

It's not a sunny one-dimensional portrait of codgers in their twilight.

Later, when she may be falling in love with him, their hands accidentally touch and then they dance. Tyson suddenly has the glow and all of the stability of an adolescent...[Jones'] immense build, especially in comparison to the petite Tyson, is again on display in ""The Gin Game,"" but to poignant effect.

Where this ""Gin Game"" stumbles is in its second half, when Coburn's play takes a series of dark turns and the two characters begin mercilessly attacking one another. Except director Leonard Foglia and his actors don't entirely take those turns alongside Coburn, preferring instead to keep the tone broad and semi-jokey...The result feels a little too much like empty calories; a ""Gin Game"" that goes down exceedingly easy, but leaves you hungry for real substance.",NJ.com,Christopher Kelly,10/14/2015

Jones is the ornery, hypercompetitive Weller; Tyson is the prim, shrewd Fonsia...As they chat, flirt and turn on each other, the play asks us to consider how much of their isolation stems from bad hands they've been dealt, and how much from bad judgment...Leonard Foglia's revival lacks that sense of purpose in its shape.

As it is, they stick at least to the outlines of the script. In so doing, they successfully establish the general outlines of their characters, and it's undeniably a nostalgic pleasure, for about one shuffle, to hear Jones boom and bustle and see Tyson offer her aren't-I-cute moue as she lays out her winning hands.

Weller counts out loud when he deals the cards and you can hear the amusement Jones finds in each pedantic number. Tyson, clutching her purse like body armor, alternates primness with fervor.

The Little Foxes,9,'The Little Foxes': Theater Review,"Sullivan's old-school refinement as a director is exactly what's called for in this merciless tale of greed and cunning. The Little Foxes is not a play loaded with subtext that rewards stripped-down surgical re-examination, which would explain why it was among the less illuminating forays into 20th-century American drama for leading experimentalist Ivo van Hove. But served straight, with the right actors, it's a crackling good yarn. The closest thing to a radical touch here is having lead actresses Laura Linney and Cynthia Nixon alternate in the roles of Regina Giddens, the hungriest of the Hubbards and ultimately the snakiest; and Birdie, her alcoholic sister-in-law and the one character legitimately descended from Southern aristocracy.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/19/2017

Properly suited up, she's a formidable opponent who fights to the death - quite literally in her harrowing scenes with husband Horace (superbly played by Thomas), whom she drags home from the hospital to sign away his money. Linney is ferocious when Regina is thwarted, but she never gives up. She flashes her dimples, she flirts, she bullies, she teases, she commands, she seethes with rage.

The Little Foxes,9,Theater Review: The Little Foxes With a Switch-’Em-Up Twist,"What remains powerfully effective, and what Sullivan's handsome production gets right, is Hellman's dissection of (and shocking prescience about) the way a systemic lack of power can turn into manipulative fury. Hellman had seen it before in the toxic capitalism that led to the Depression and did not imagine it would disappear anytime soon from the human repertoire of injustice. After all, she took her title - courtesy of Dorothy Parker - from the Song of Solomon's image of little foxes that ""spoil the vines"" and the tender grapes thereon.",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/19/2017

Her survivor's gift for staying one diabolical step ahead of the men - who would cheat her in a lucrative deal over a cotton mill - makes her more than a cardboard evildoer. That impression is encouraged in the performances of the men, who also include Oscar and Birdie's sniveling son, Leo (Michael Benz, wearing entitlement like a fitted shirt). McKean's Ben is a subtle demon, Goldstein's Oscar a more transparently brutish one.

Mr. Sullivan's confident production doesn't deny melodrama, but it prefers psychological and social detail over Southern gothic fripperies. (Scott Pask's fraying, elegant set and Jane Greenwood's shrewd costumes, with ruffles for Birdie and a sleeker silhouette for Regina, also reflect this emphasis.) It asks both actresses to make the roles more than villain and victim, which the play allows. You might wish that Hellman had written the faithful retainer parts with greater breadth, but Charles Turner and particularly Caroline Stefanie Clay play them with nuance.",New York Times,Alexis Soloski,04/19/2017
The Little Foxes,8,The Little Foxes,"Daniel Sullivan directs Hellman's Alabama tale with a crisp vigor that smooths over its melodramatic bumps. The prime mover is Regina, who plots with brothers Ben and Oscar (malevolently perfect Michael McKean and Darren Goldstein) to close a deal on a cotton mill in order to make them all filthy rich. The cast is uniformly strong, and outstanding work comes from the leading ladies. Linney is fire and ice: regal yet ready to spit venom. And Nixon, in the configuration I saw, is delicately touching as the meek, damaged Birdie. The Little Foxes may not command as high a prospect in the pantheon of American drama as more poetic work by Tennessee Williams or Eugene O'Neill, but it's cunningly built and packs a punch; it's the August: Osage County of the interwar years.",TimeOut NY,David Cote,04/19/2017

But the nonprofit Manhattan Theatre Club has not merely dared to cast Laura Linney and Cynthia Nixon - sublimely intelligent actors, but hardly summer tourist-bait - to play grasping, glamorous Regina and her mousy, quietly alcoholic sister-in-law Birdie Hubbard in the company's Broadway venue.

Birdie's one truly memorable appearance occurs at the start of the third act, with a touching speech about how rarely she's experienced happiness. As they change, so do the supporting characters around them. Richard Thomas delivers a particularly physical performance as Horace, who sees the world with the clarity of a dying man.

She wins a business victory over her brothers but loses much more when she allows her husband to die and drives away her only daughter. Linney, in this iteration, has a much smaller role as the fretful Birdie, but she also reveals her stunning chameleonic abilities, downplaying her natural radiance.

Beowulf Boritt's playful, imaginative scenic and projection design and Jason Lyons' vivid lighting deserve mention as well.

That production could have worked on Broadway, too, but Barrington Stage's version was equally fine, and now that it's here, I urge you to see it as soon as you possibly can.

He enlists the aid of choreographer Joshua Bergasse (NBC's Smash) to channel the expressive athleticism of Robbins' dances. The chief element retained from the director's earlier brush with the show is his winning lead Tony Yazbeck, a dependable Broadway yeoman who arguably has never been more ideally cast than as Gabey. Whether in dramatic scenes, songs or in his rapturous dance numbers, Yazbeck brings just the right balance of masculinity and vulnerability, unworldliness and floating-on-air grace to the openhearted farm boy dreaming of love.

On the Town,8,‘On the Town’ revival wins with Megan Fairchild’s performance,"The bell-bottomed boys traditionally dominate this show, but the brightest star in this new revival isn't one of them: It's Megan Fairchild, a New York City Ballet principal now making her Broadway debut. That she's graceful and strikes breathtakingly beautiful lines was a given. Which is good because Fairchild plays a key role in this dance-heavy musical -- originally choreographed by Jerome Robbins, now by Joshua Bergasse. But it turns out the elfin ballerina's also a nimble, effortlessly funny comedienne. The show explodes with unfettered joy every time she's onstage. When she's not, it's more complicated...Betty Comden and Adolph Green's book and lyrics still crackle and pop after all these decades, and therein lies the rub: The show's already written funny, so director John Rando's frantic oversell can feel a little desperate.",NY Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,10/16/2014

And that's just the broads, as they say in the Navy!...Beowulf Boritt's set and projection designs are sparse yet expansive; they tantalize with the visual suggestion that the vast stage is always about to be filled with dancers, great dancers. The 1,800-seat Lyric Theatre is never kind to comedy; its cavernous space eats up the laughter, but Rando brings the action downstage and into the auditorium as often as possible, and as soon as the chorus breaks into dance the theater bursts with contagious energy. The new Lyric Theatre, something of a white elephant, works for the first time in its short history on 42nd Street...Whenever Comden and Green's book begins to sag, there's another great ballet, not to mention Bernstein's music, just waiting around the corner.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,10/16/2014

Here she displays unexpected comic finesse, especially in her voice-lesson scene with Madame Dilly, one of many cartoon roles mastered by Jackie Hoffman. If Fairchild's acting lacks projection, especially compared to the other two female leads -- Alysha Umphress as Hildy and Elizabeth Stanley as Claire -- she compensates during the dance numbers. The choreography, by Joshua Bergasse, is inspired, though Robbins would have cracked the whip harder on the ensemble during the door-slamming number. All three male leads blend sweetness with virility. Clyde Alves is a swaggering Ozzie, Jay Armstrong Johnson a pratfall-mastering Chip, and Tony Yazbeck a deservedly centre-stage Gabey.",Financial Times,Brendan Lemon,10/16/2014

But although it occasionally pushes too hard, John Rando's production inspires considerable affection. The three able-bodied seamen each get moments to show off their abilities (and their bodies), and their other two main squeezes (Alysha Umpress and Elizabeth Stanley) sing well; the supporting cast of zanies (including Allison Gunn, Stephen DeRosa, Philip Boykin and the always-ripe Jackie Hoffman) give the streets of New York a suitable complement of muggers. I suspect there will be people who love the torch-carrying spirit of this On the Town, and I wish them, and it, the best.

Garfield, in one of the most emotionally naked performances I’ve ever witnessed in the theater, lets us see the crippling weight of Willy’s overblown expectations. This young man becomes the play’s protagonist in a kind of Oedipal stage reversal that is thrilling to behold. ...

But by eschewing any shades of folk or billowy sweetness in favor of an all-consuming need for Jesus' attention, she nails the famous ballads, “I Don't Know How to Love Him” and “Could We Start Again Please?” which is what people want from her the most in the theater and are the two most common questions people ask of Jesus in the world outside.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,03/22/2012

Kushnier meets the difficult requirements of the demanding score while making Judas more than a hissable villain. He makes the decision to betray Jesus understandable if not sympathetic. The reliable Tom Hewitt makes for a formidable Pilate.

The next time it arrived, it won for best play revival. This time it just may sneak away with the trophy for best musical revival. A thoroughly excellent and tuneful version of Tom Stoppard's brilliant play about love and fidelity opened Thursday at the American Airlines Theatre, directed by Sam Gold and featuring a dozen songs, both sung onstage by the actors between scenes or wafting out of record players...Some may grouse that they may be a little too on-point for such a slippery play, but the actors integrate them well...The seven-member cast is first-rate...McGregor rarely lets his mask down, but when he does -- moaning alone or quietly sobbing -- it's heartbreaking. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Annie...with a fierce opaqueness, her face decorated with a clever, knowing smile or a cool standoffishness.

But everyone...is appealing and smart. And this romantic serio-comedy -- Stoppard's most accessible work -- remains a dizzying Chinese box of unpredictable devises that express devastating compassion for that most basic yet elusive human emotion. The problem, and I'm afraid there is one, comes from the look of director Sam Gold's production, which works against immediacy by spreading the action on a set so wide and cool it invites the big theater to swallow up the intimacy.

Gold's work with the actors is perfectly sound; McGregor and Gyllenhaal are naturally charismatic, intelligent performers who deliver Stoppard's brainy badinage with nervy aplomb. It's just the sing-alongs that got on my nerves...But Gold's excavation of this element doesn't add anything, just directorial static...It's a strong ensemble, featuring a brief but memorable turn by Ronan Raftery as one of Annie's ardent admirers.

But director Sam Gold's fussy production blurs the distinction between scenes with a single drab set and cast-sung interludes of '60s pop.

He's almost flighty in his goodwill and quick repartee, and it's soon obvious that he's using his intellect to distance himself from what he really feels. It's an interpretation that's immensely entertainment, but one that might fail if not for Gyllenhaal, who always brings his character's exhilarating, often eccentric, verbal flights back to earth...Meanwhile, the world around them on stage is sometimes a bit off kilter -- and not always in a good way...Gold's directorial flourish isn't lethal, but it gets the play off to a bumpy start...This revival isn't perfect, but McGregor and Gyllenhaal are definitely The Real Thing.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,10/30/2014

One yearns for the over-coiffed McGregor to loosen up: the likeable Scotsman seems a tad stolid playing the so-called ""Henry of Mayfair"", a role to which his lanky, rangy predecessors were suited down to the last hyper-articulate quip. Gyllenhaal has her moments, especially near the start, but she doesn't come naturally by the effortless sensuality needed to play a grown-up minx.

Maggie Gyllenhaal also brings poise and sophistication to the actress who breaks up his marriage and becomes his second wife. But pretty much everything else in Sam Gold's hollow revival is a little off. That goes for a terribly miscast Cynthia Nixon, a too-literal design concept that's hard on the eyes, and sing-along scene changes that are as cloying as they are superfluous, serving mainly to yank us out of the play.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,10/30/2014

This has partly to do with Stoppard's middle-of-the-roadness, and partly with McGregor's refusal to engage with Henry's darker side. Even Gyllenhaal's feline sexiness seems overly laid-back.

The ubiquitous Sam Gold directs, and perhaps it's his crowded schedule that explains what goes wrong with this Real Thing when things do go wrong. The chief problem is that he has the actors present their characters as terribly, teddibly arch. It's an off-putting approach that somehow renders banter of an amusing slant not very amusing at all.

(The costumes, by Kaye Voyce, get more disheveled as the action ramps up.) But while watching them go at it is entertaining, what the play is fighting for isn't as clear. There are themes of sibling rivalry and family strife (their father, unseen but spoken of, is a drunk living alone out in the desert), the idealized lawlessness of the Wild West, the way Hollywood deals are done and just as easily undone.

The expansive American Airlines Theatre isn't intimate enough to provide the necessary air of claustrophobia; the slack pacing of Act I allows boredom to settle in; and Hawke, as good as he is, is a bit too studied in his affect.

He's so recessive for so long that Lee has nothing much to push against. Shepard builds tension between the brothers scene by scene, but here, an Austin who bends, deflates, and dwindles so easily and so consistently starts to make the play feel repetitive rather than cumulative, a drone rather than a gradual ribcage-rattling crescendo. When Dano finally reaches Austin's key aria - in which he quietly tells Lee the grim, pathetic story of their alcoholic father's trip to Juarez to get all his teeth pulled by a backstreet dentist - he's at last in his melancholy element.

This is the sort of piece where direction ought to be invisible, just clearing space for the actors to breathe and fill the air, and Arbus does fine work.

(Among those who have played Merrick on Broadway since Philip Anglim created the role in 1979 are David Bowie, Mark Hamill, and Billy Crudup.) In the new revival, based on the 2012 Williamstown Theatre Festival production, Bradley Cooper more than qualifies: He is extremely handsome, he is seminude (at least part of the time), and not only demonstrates but proves those chops.",Vulture,Jesse Green,12/07/2014

His breathing is labored and full of gurgles and gasps, yet when Merrick speaks, it is a thoughtful, refined tenor.

The dramatic events - a crisis of confidence and conscience for Treves, a scandal involving an uncorseted Mrs Kendal - seem obvious contrivance on the part of the playwright rather than incidents demanded by character and circumstance. And yet what does that matter? Well before opening, the show had set box-office records.

And because the 55-year-old work remains astonishingly relevant today, I can happily say Denzel and company are ""da bomb.""",NY1,Roma Torre,04/03/2014
A Raisin in the Sun,9,No Rest for the Weary,"The spark of rebellion, the kind that makes a man stand up and fight, has almost been extinguished in Walter Lee Younger. As portrayed by Denzel Washington in Kenny Leon's disarmingly relaxed revival of Lorraine Hansberry's ""A Raisin in the Sun"" -- which opened on Thursday night at the Ethel Barrymore Theater -- Walter appears worn down, worn out and about ready to crawl into bed for good. Frankly, he looks a whole lot older than you probably remember him...Mr. Washington's more laid-back approach has a persuasive emotional logic, and it adds a different kind of suspense to ""Raisin."" As the play tells its familiar story of the Youngers' attempts to leave the South Side for the suburbs, with the life insurance money left by Lena's husband, we're less worried that Walter is going to erupt into violence than sink into stasis, dragging his family down with him.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,04/03/2014
A Raisin in the Sun,9,Review: Washington great in 'A Raisin in the Sun',"The show that opened Thursday night at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre is blistering, beautifully acted and superbly touching...Director Kenny Leon gets a second bite of the apple...and offers a throbbing, vibrant production that is a match for this 55-year-old American masterpiece. There's real humor here, too, both physical and scripted. Washington is startlingly good as Walter Lee Younger, the frustrated chauffeur and dreamer. He has the cadences and the trapped physicality in his bones -- warm and loose until he's cold and volatile...The script says Washington is supposed to be 35 -- the actor is 59 -- but all that matters is a brilliant performance, funny and poignant.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,04/03/2014
A Raisin in the Sun,9,Reviews of 'A Raisin in the Sun' and 'If/Then',"Mr. Leon is an inspired craftsman who creates the illusion that he's merely staying out of the way of a good script. What he does, of course, isn't nearly that simple, but you'll never catch yourself noticing this or that clever touch. All that's visible is the finished product, a piece of storytelling as plain and true and beautiful as a well-laid brick wall...Mr. Washington, though he looks good, also looks his years, so much so that the script has been quietly and pointlessly altered to make him say he's 40, not 35. (He doesn't look 40, either.) Why does this matter? Because ""A Raisin in the Sun"" is a naturalistic kitchen-sink drama played out on a you-are-there Chicago tenement set designed by Mark Thompson that's so faded and worn that you can almost see through the wallpaper. It's supposed to look real.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,04/03/2014
A Raisin in the Sun,9,A Raisin in the Sun: Theater Review,"Denzel Washington is the star attraction, but it's the harmonious balance of an impeccably matched ensemble that makes Kenny Leon's lovingly staged revival of A Raisin in the Sun so alive with authentic feeling. The warmth as well as the frictions and frustrations of a real family ripple through this lived-in production, with an accomplished cast that nestles deep into every moment of humor, hope and sadness. Even in its more dated passages, Lorraine Hansberry's groundbreaking 1959 play remains a work of stirring compassion and humanity.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/03/2014
A Raisin in the Sun,9,Broadway Review: ‘A Raisin in the Sun’ with Denzel Washington,"Denzel Washington's rabid fans won't be seeing their idol in this heart-stopping revival of Lorraine Hansberry's ground-breaking 1959 play, ""A Raisin in the Sun."" They'll be seeing Walter Lee Younger, the scion of a hard-working black family who sees his dreams of success slipping away on the post-WWII racial battlefront of Chicago's South Side. The performance is a personal triumph for Washington, who refrains from star-strutting to fold himself into a tight-knit ensemble of committed stage thesps who treat this revival like a labor of love.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,04/03/2014
A Raisin in the Sun,9,"OME > ENTERTAINMENT > THE SCENE Review: Thanks to a Strong Ensemble, Director Kenny Leon's ""Sun"" Shines","Washington has such an easygoing way about him that it seems to transfer by osmosis to the other actors -- we experience this in his first scenes on stage, where he seems to bring his own age down by a half-century, cavorting with son Travis (a very good Bryce Clyde Jenkins, in his Broadway debut) after they one-up Ruth over some small change Travis needs for school. Washington switches just as easily to a man simmering with rage that he can't amply provide for his family. But here's the thing: the actor, 59, plays a character on the cusp of 40 -- that age when we realize we might not accomplish all the things we dreamed of doing in our 20s. From the audience, the discrepancy makes a difference. I spent too much time thinking about how Washington is older than his character, and not enough time enjoying his performance.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,04/03/2014
A Raisin in the Sun,9,'A Raisin in the Sun' review: Magnificent Denzel Washington,"Remember the questions raised about Denzel Washington being too old to play Walter Lee Younger...Forget all that. Forget any and all reservations, except the kind that are so hard to get for director Kenny Leon's shattering revival of Lorraine Hansberry's seminal 1959 drama about a struggling black family in Chicago. Washington, 59, is magnificent -- disaffected, exuberant, heart-shredding -- as the character Sidney Poitier created on Broadway when just 32. Yes, this Walter Lee now says he is 40, not 35, in one of his raw and bruised laments about a life that never really began. But the numbers mean nothing in this devastating portrayal, except to deepen it.",Newsday,Linda Winer,04/03/2014
A Raisin in the Sun,9,"Theater Review: A Raisin in the Sun, With a Star Who Knows What to Do in the Role","Everyone's moaning about Denzel Washington's age...Well, none of that matters. If anything, Washington comes off as no more mature than his character's pre-adolescent son. His Walter has the caught-in-a-trap itchiness of a teenager. He doesn't walk but rolls into a room, his loosey-goosey limbs desperately insinuating a joie de vivre his actual living lacks. (He's a chauffeur.) Washington has always been a very physical actor, locating the essence of a role in his body and in the music of the words, when he could get his mouth around them...Here, in the second Broadway revival of Lorraine Hansberry's classic, he's almost dancing the part, especially in a priceless drunk scene that ends with his burlesquing black minstrelsy and all but singing ""Mammy."" Even without reference to the previous Broadway Walter -- a stuporous Sean Combs -- this is an electric performance; you forget about the actor's age as quickly as you forget, in most plays that are cast color-blind, about race.",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/03/2014
A Raisin in the Sun,9,Denzel Washington in Broadway’s resonant new “A Raisin in the Sun”,"After a lukewarm stab at ""A Raisin in the Sun"" a decade ago, director Kenny Leon has returned to Lorraine Hansberry's definitive story of African-American aspiration with a potent new Broadway revival starring Denzel Washington and Anika Noni Rose that reaffirms its place in the pantheon of great American drama. In his second crack at Hansberry's 1959 masterwork...Leon in concert with his cast finds the driving rhythm of bitterness that suffuses the work and in particular, the character of Walter Lee Younger. Washington is, in fact, older than Younger by a couple of decades. Nevertheless, the actor gives a sterling account of Walter Lee's careless sourness, an aura of self-defeat that renders utterly credible the decision he makes that all but scuttles the family's rise to middle class security.",Washington Post,Peter Marks,04/03/2014
A Raisin in the Sun,9,Washington leads spirited cast in ‘A Raisin in the Sun’ revival,"'A Raisin in the Sun"" endures for good reason. Lorraine Hansberry's 1959 play - the first by a black woman on Broadway - features several meaty roles and enough dramatic momentum to keep audiences on the edge of their seats. No wonder stars are drawn to this classic, even when they aren't necessarily right for it. Ten years ago, Sean Combs (a?k?a Puff Daddy) picked ""Raisin"" for his Broadway debut.",NY Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,04/03/2014

A Raisin in the Sun,8,A Raisin in the Sun,"What happens to a play revived? A Raisin in the Sun, Lorraine Hansberry's powerful 1959 drama, has certainly not dried up: It bursts with intense family conflict, racial politics and social consciousness. Nor, in its new incarnation, does it sag with the heavy load of an underqualified star, as the 2004 Sean Combs revival did. The pivotal role of Walter Lee Younger-a restless Chicago chauffeur and would-be/won't-be entrepreneur-is played by Denzel Washington; though 20 years older than Walter Lee, he is persuasively youthful (with an apt suggestion of seeming old before his time), and brings considerable charm and magnetism to a difficult, often unsympathetic role. Neither, however, does this production quite explode. Directed by Kenny Leon, who also helmed the 2004 version, this is a credible, realistically scaled account of a still-vital classic.",Time Out NY,Adam Feldman,04/03/2014
A Raisin in the Sun,8,STAGE REVIEW A Raisin in the Sun,"Denzel Washington is a powerful presence as restless working-class family man Walter Lee Younger in A Raisin in the Sun...The minute he walks on stage, the Oscar winner receives a roar of audience delight, and his tightly coiled physicality is a pleasure to watch, with one caveat: Washington's characteristic aura of forceful energy, as well as the 59-year-old actor's middle-aged maturity, throws off the emotional balance of this smooth new production, directed by Kenny Leon a decade after he staged a previous Broadway revival of the show. While Washington's charisma is a great boost for ticket sales, his vitality contradicts just how precarious the dreams of Walter, written as a younger, weaker black man, really are.",Entertainment Weekly,Lisa Schwarzbaum,04/03/2014
A Raisin in the Sun,7,"First Nighter: Denzel Washington Good, Not So Good in ""A Raisin in the Sun""","For this version, Walter Lee describes himself as 40, and therein lies the problem. Washington is 59, and can get away (almost) with appearing as a man almost 20 years younger than he is, but something is still wrong. Hansberry intends Walter Lee's playing fast and loose with the much needed incoming funds to be attributed to a young man's impetuosity. His behavior in those circumstances is understandable if not excusable. Washington, on the other hand, looks too much like a man who long should have known better...Having established all that, I should add that the manner in which Washington skews Hansberry's purpose probably won't bother the actor's fans. They'll be thrilled again to see him up close and personal. And it isn't as if--aside from the way he's miscast himself (the revival is, of course, his choice)--he doesn't give a committed performance.",Huffington Post,David Finkle,04/03/2014
A Raisin in the Sun,7,Theater review: 'A Raisin in the Sun',"And Washington, despite his fine work, doesn't reach down to reveal the shattering impact on Walter of his dream's destruction. The one performer who allows us inside is Okonedo, a British actress making a superb New York stage debut. Using all the details of the actor's art - small gestures, slight changes in expression - she somehow reveals Ruth's soul. And that makes her longing to establish the family in its own home the most affecting dream of all.",NorthJersey.com,Robert Feldberg,04/03/2014
A Raisin in the Sun,6,Denzel doesn't fit Younger role in 'Raisin in the Sun',"This age problem is, at minimum, a distraction, an elephant in the room for a play that deserves no such issue in its way. I'd argue it does some damage to the actual play itself, an issue never more apparent than when Lena ""Mama"" Younger (LaTanya Richardson Jackson) turns to her daughter-in-law Ruth (Sophie Okonedo) and marvels at how her immature son, having just kicked out a representative from the white residents' association, played by David Cromer, finally has come into his manhood. One is aware that one just has watched a scene of power and assertion, but the notion of the arrival of some kind of delayed maturity for a young man who has felt like a coiled-up spring is, well, stupid. What was everyone thinking? There is one exceptionally fine performance in this otherwise mostly unremarkable revival, staged on a set by Mark Thompson that feels overly fancy for a Chicago apartment house. Okonedo's world-weary but hopeful Ruth is a beautiful piece of acting, at once determined, kind, hopeful, loving and sad.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/03/2014
A Raisin in the Sun,5,Theater review: 'A Raisin in the Sun' -- 2 stars,"It's too bad Denzel Washington didn't play Walter Lee, the dissatisfied 35-year-old protagonist of Lorraine Hansberry's monumental 1959 African-American family drama ""A Raisin in the Sun,"" 25 years ago. Now at age 59, there is no escaping the reality that Washington is simply too old to convincingly play the role, resulting in a fundamental imbalance and lack of credibility to the new Broadway revival...In addition to the age issue, Washington overplays Walter Lee's moodiness and often adds an inappropriately jocular and hammy tone, encouraging the audience to laugh during some of the play's most heartbreaking moments. Rose, who sparkles in scene after scene, ends up stealing the show. As Walter Lee's wife Ruth, Sophie Okonedo comes off as one-dimensionally plain and stern. Jackson too is disappointing. David Cromer, best known as a director, is out of place as the community representative who tries to bribe the family to not move to a white suburb.",amNY,Matt Windman,04/03/2014
King Lear,10,Glenda Jackson holds court as Broadway's King Lear: EW review,"There are any number of quotes from King Lear that one might employ to kick off a discussion of how fully Glenda Jackson embodies William Shakespeare's disintegrating ruler. ""Every inch a King,"" might do, though it is spoken ironically in Act IV, when things have fallen well apart. Rather, what came to mind not long into a viewing of director Sam Gold's outstanding production of Lear now at New York's Cort Theatre, was the bit of dialogue above, from Terrence McNally's 1994 play Love! Valour! Compassion!. Machismo just begins to graze it. The tragedy of the mad king is a study of masculine power battling its own decline and Jackson, with self-ruinous male ego animating her wiry frame, feasts on the notoriously challenging role.",Entertainment Weekly,Allison Adato,04/04/2019
King Lear,9,Glenda Jackson Earns Crown In Broadway’s ‘King Lear’: Review,"Wilson, her vocal delivery as elastic, youthful and whoop-whooping as Jackson's is throaty and grave, is handed one of Gold's strongest theatrical ideas late in the play, as the Fool prepares to take his leave, Cordelia soon to return (in all-black pseudo-Marxist revolutionary garb, no less). Scholars have long debated on whether the Fool is actually Cordelia in disguise, and judging from a simple, revealing coup de theatre, Gold suggests he has the answer. It isn't the first or last moment of truth in this extraordinary production.",Deadline,Greg Evans,04/04/2019
King Lear,9,Glenda Jackson roars in an amazing 'King Lear’ on Broadway: review,"She looks like no King Lear you've ever seen before - a small, thin woman in a black suit, her silver pageboy combed neatly to the side. Yet when the legendary British actress Glenda Jackson begins to speak - and then to fulminate and rage as only the narcissistic, aggrieved Lear can - she mows down men three times her size. The contrast is thrilling, and a key to the success of Sam Gold's smashing new production of the Shakespeare chestnut, now playing at the Cort Theatre on Broadway. This is a ""King Lear"" that wholly captures the complexities and contradictions of its title character, a still-roaring lion who refuses to accept that winter has dawned.",NJ.com,Christopher Kelly,04/04/2019

King Lear,8,Glenda Jackson in Shakespeare’s ‘King Lear’ on Broadway: Tragedy and a Lot of Trump-Era Sighing,"The joy of watching Glenda Jackson as Lear in Sam Gold's lean and clear production is that she doesn't approach every well-known speech or phrasing at a grandiloquent gallop. Jackson's most noticeable verbal extravagance is an almost comically elongated rolling of her r's, and so ""crawl"" becomes crrrrrrrrrawl.""

King Lear,7,Review: Glenda Jackson battles through a brazenly busy ‘King Lear’ on Broadway,"Much of Jackson's performance takes place on the elocutionary level. She doesn't so much speak her lines as seethe them. Vowels are stretched for whooshing emphasis; consonants are crashed upon with the force of a speeding car against a highway divider. The diction is so pyrotechnical that it may come as a surprise to learn that Jackson's Lear is more personalized this time around, more human. In London, she was a stylized archetype waging war against the gods. Here, she's a declining father whose dictatorial temperament is making for a rough ending. Unfortunately, the production and her performance often seem at loggerheads.",LA Times,Charles McNulty,04/04/2019
King Lear,7,'King Lear': Theater Review,"It's often said that there's no greater grief than a parent's loss of a child, so it follows that there's no more devastating moment in King Lear than when the monarch's pitiless odyssey through familial betrayal, rage and madness, triggered by his own blind vanity, leaves him cradling the dead body of the one daughter whose love for him was pure. That goes double when the title character's tragic arc is explored, in Sam Gold's aggressively modern, gender-blind production, by the magnificent Glenda Jackson. The searing pathos of Lear's abject diminishment seems all the more powerful given the steely authority that precedes it.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/04/2019
King Lear,7,REVIEW: Glenda Jackson is extraordinary as Shakespeare’s mad monarch in uneven production of ‘King Lear’,"Like a lot of intense, progressive, secular work in this time of revolutionary exploration on Broadway, Gold's ""King Lear"" just has a better understanding of what needs to go than what needs to take its place. It wrestles mightily with the play's inherent moralism, religiosity and conservatism, and its demands that we feel our obligations.

King Lear,6,Review: Glenda Jackson Rules a Muddled World in ‘King Lear’,"It should surprise no one that Ms. Jackson is delivering a powerful and deeply perceptive performance as the most royally demented of Shakespeare's monarchs. But much of what surrounds her in this glittery, haphazard production seems to be working overtime to divert attention from that performance. That includes a perfectly lovely string quartet - playing original music by Philip Glass, no less - that under other circumstances I would have enjoyed listening to. Here, though, this intermittent concert seems to be competing with, rather than underscoring, Shakespeare's bleakest tragedy. The same might be said of Miriam Buether's blindingly gold set (lighted to sear the eyes by Jane Cox), which blazes with nouveau riche vulgarity.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,04/04/2019
King Lear,6,King Lear,"Gold's production is full of interesting directorial choices that do not quite cohere into a shared universe for King Lear's characters to inhabit. The subtle Ruth Wilson plays Cordelia with soulful, depressive interiority-in a wise stroke of casting, she doubles as the Fool-while the hyperintense Aisling O'Sullivan, as Regan, looks at every moment like lasers are about to shoot from her eyes. Jayne Houdyshell, John Douglas Thompson and Dion Johnstone offer conventional turns as the play's Lear loyalists; Sean Carvajal flails through the thankless role of Edgar.

It's not the tragedy of a great king gone mad but rather of a great play that's lost its wits and its way.

Jersey Boys,8,Jersey Boys: Welcome to Falsettoland,"Now we have Jersey Boys; an exceedingly fun and electrifyingly staged tale of the rise and fall of The Four Seasons, which smartly uses their hit songs as a sort of background soundtrack to the story of a group of blue-collar guys establishing a distinctive sound during the early years of rock and roll. They sing songs on stages, in clubs, and in recording studios, but, aside from a couple of missteps, never as part of a book scene. And yet director Des McAnuff, by being very stingy with applause breaks until the audience is ready to burst, and bookwriters Marshall Brickman & Rick Elice, by deftly weaving the dialogue in and out of the music, have found a method to use songs to fuel the story without overwhelming it. Fans of The Four Seasons may walk in excited to hear familiar favorites like ""Sherry"", ""Big Girls Don't Cry"", ""Rag Doll"" and ""Walk Like a Man"", but they should leave the theatre impressed with how plot-driven the entire production is without ever short-handing the music.

Fluently scripted by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, this classic rags-to-riches story is narrated in turn by each member of the 4 Seasons, beginning with Belleville wise guy Tommy DeVito, who organized the group between his visits to the slammer in the late 1950s. Energetically weaving story, songs, visuals and exciting performances into a can't-stop-the-music tidal wave, director Des McAnuff stages a compelling rush of events that pauses only occasionally to savor the beauty of certain songs.

Jersey Boys,7,From Blue-Collar Boys to Doo-Wop Sensation: A Band's Rise and Fall,"In a year in which one pop-songbook show after another has thudded and died, ""Jersey Boys,"" a shrink-wrapped musical biography of the pop group the Four Seasons, passes as silver instead of as the chrome-plated jukebox that it is. Unlike the recent Broadway flops, this show has the advantage of featuring singers that actually sound like the singers they are portraying and a technology-enhanced band that approximates the original sound of their music. Scriptwriters Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice provide some likably sassy dialogue as they chart the evolution of their main characters from street kids in the urban wastelands of New Jersey to pop gods enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice have written a clever book, which should become the template for this kind of musical excavation; it sets up the songs with well-judged humor and the elegant strokes of observation that the Four Seasons repertoire lacks. At one point, during Valli's first date with Mary (Jennifer Naimo), the baleboste who becomes his first wife, she asks why he spells his invented Italian surname with a 'y' and not an 'i.' - 'Y' is such a bullshit letter,' she says. 'It doesn?t know what it is. Is it a vowel' Is it a consonant?' 'Jersey Boys' knows exactly what it is: a money tree.

The director has no illusions about what drives this sort of show. Jersey Boys may aim only to be a shallow, big-budget, crowd-pleasing jukebox musical, but it's a model of the genre. Admire first the deftness of the storytelling by librettists Marshall Brickman (who co-wrote Annie Hall) and Rick Elice. From the hardscrabble early scenes, which mostly involve band members- rotating in and out of jail ('the Rahway Academy of the Arts,' as the scholar-in-residence DeVito puts it), the script uses a Scorsese trick to race the action along: The boys' narration propels the story by layering exposition right over the songs. Sugar and medicine are calibrated so finely that, almost before you realize it, the boys have traded their horrible clashing pink shirts for the true badge of early-sixties pop success, matching maroon blazers.

The Color Purple,10,"Review: ‘The Color Purple’ on Broadway, Stripped to Its Essence","Give thanks this morning, children of Broadway, and throw in a hearty hallelujah. ""The Color Purple"" has been born again, and its conversion is a glory to behold...The current version is a slim, fleet-footed beauty, simply attired and beguilingly modest. Don't be deceived, though, by its air of humility. There's a deep wealth of power within its restraint...it allows audiences to zero in on a show's musical and emotional essence, while seeming to place narrative control directly in the hands of the performers...Ms. Hudson radiates a lush, supple stage presence that is echoed by her velvet voice...But the greatest joy of all, at least for longtime believers in theater mythology, is the ascendancy of Ms. Erivo...Celie undergoes a drastic metamorphosis from battered, invisible wife to determined, self-reliant businesswoman. Ms. Erivo escorts us through these transformations with a subtle but tensile performance that parallels her character's evolution. Like the rest of the show, she never oversells herself; she asks us politely but compellingly to listen...",New York Times,Ben Brantley,12/10/2015
The Color Purple,10,http://www.timeout.com/newyork/theater/the-color-purple,"In the glorious Broadway revival of The Color Purple (* * * * out of four stars)...leading lady Cynthia Erivo -- remember the name, because you'll be hearing more of it -- speaks mostly in a low, wry voice. ""Speaks"" would be the operative word here, because when Erivo raises that voice in song, it soars with a force that seems almost supernatural, but is also distinctly, piercingly human...In Purple, the director confronted a less cohesive score...with lyrics that, like Marsha Norman's book, can flirt with platitudes. Those words and music remain, but under Doyle's guidance...they seem reborn. Melodies float and swing in more R&B-savvy arrangements, providing showcases for the extravagantly gifted singer/actors featured here...The Color Purple is ultimately a story of redemption, and Doyle and his cast do a miraculous job of capturing that essence, down to its spiritual core, without getting preachy or mawkish.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,12/10/2015
The Color Purple,10,Theater Review: The Color Purple Is One of the Greatest Revivals Ever,"For once, the word ""revival"" is apt: Doyle's intervention amounts to a kind of theatrical CPR, restarting the heart of a show that, in its original production, seemed to die before your eyes...Of course it takes actors who have the subtlety to work at this level...The paradoxical result is a far greater range; the show is not constantly hitting the ceiling. Erivo...proves especially masterful at calibrating the gradations of Celie's emergence, from a kind of dull curiosity when she meets Shug Avery, to the suppressed rage of her nascent rebellion against Mister, to the exquisite shy smile that breaks across her face when she allows herself to believe she is beautiful, to the full sunburst of pleasure that success (as a seamstress) finally affords her.

The Color Purple,9,'The Color Purple': Theater Review,"Wow, what a difference a more-focused production makes. When the musical adaptation of Alice Walker's searing story of abuse and deliverance, The Color Purple, premiered on Broadway in 2005, its rewards were compromised by the messy and emphatic qualities of the overblown production. Ten years later, director John Doyle and an electric cast assembled around transcendent British newcomer Cynthia Erivo as Celie have given the show a deep -- and deeply satisfying -- rethink. This revelatory overhaul is characterized by its grace, restraint and soaring spirituality, peeling back the clutter to expose the life-affirming material's molten emotional core.

In a feat of reverse magic, Doyle's minimalist production maximizes the strength and beauty of Marsha Norman's book...Both the beauty and the brains of the score are evident in the fact that each character's signature song belongs only to that character.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,12/10/2015

The Color Purple,9,Jennifer Hudson & Cynthia Erivo Are Red Hot In Dazzling ‘Color Purple’ Revival – Review,"Propelled by a pair of knockout performances from Jennifer Hudson and Cynthia Erivo, both making their Broadway debuts, this transfer from London's Menier Chocolate Factory takes a minimalist visual approach to a story that sprawls across decades and continents, training the focus firmly on the twists and turns of Alice Walker's highly populated, Brontë-worthy tale...Marsha Norman's book cunningly trims the story to essentials, and the songs by Brenda Russell, Allee Willis and Stephen Bray get the job done...What sets the production so strikingly apart from the original is director John Doyle's spartan approach to the physical setting, which he also designed...I'm not always a fan of Doyle's approach but here...he shows a mastery of character revealed. And so in the best show-biz sense, The Color Purple is more than the sum of its considerable parts.

But on the whole, it is far more dramatically charged and focused than the elaborate but undistinguished original production. This feels less like a revival than a revitalization, or a new musical altogether. Erivo credibly conveys Celie's 180-degree transformation in personality. The big-voiced Brooks burns with ferocity while slipping into moments of good humor. Hudson is fully authoritative and altogether fantastic in the diva role.

The new ""Color Purple"" never loses sight of its Celie, and Doyle keeps the show revolving around the stunning performance of Cynthia Erivo in the role. She isn't better than LaChanze, Erivo is just different -- very grounded, less impish and adorable. Her more naturalistic approach roots the show, and that's needed because Doyle's minimalism here is very fanciful...Erivo dominates, as she must. But it's a real contest between her and Danielle Brooks' big-voiced, full-bodied Sofie...Jennifer Hudson, in her Broadway debut, brings star presence to the role of Celie's fickle lover, Shug Avery...Here is another big, rich voice, and it is entirely apt that Hudson should be showy with her overuse of melisma.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,12/10/2015

It's the strength, collective and individual, of the 17 extraordinary vocal performances of ""The Color Purple"" -- doubtless the best version of this 2005 musical you are ever going to hear...What remains of ""The Color Purple""...is a sleek, fast-paced treatment -- virtually a concert version -- of the journey of Erivo's heart-melting Celie...The setting seems a reflection of unvarnished Celie, who only wants out of life the simple, comforting joys of loving family and fulfilling work...There's more than enough combustibility on that stage, though, to compensate for any occasional energy deficits.

This ""Color Purple"" instead belongs to the virtually unknown British actress Cynthia Erivo, who as Celie gives one of those galvanizing, star-is-born performances of which Broadway dreams are made. She beautifully captures Celie's 40-year progression, from abused and meek daughter and wife to confident single woman and mother; and she turns musical numbers that might easily be overly cutesy (""Miss Celie's Pants"") or schmaltzy (""I'm Here"") into punch-in-the-gut anthems of self-discovery.

For those of us who watched Hudson in concert early in her career, this performance, which is vocally exquisite, shows the remarkable growth as an actress...But Hudson is not the performer who brings down the house...That work belongs to Cynthia Erivo, the British actress playing -- actually, inhabiting is the better word -- the role of Celie and who, better than the several other actresses I have seen play this role, captures not just the fullness of her pain but the stature of her resilience.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,12/10/2015

Jennifer Hudson, who plays Shug Avery, has been brought in for the Broadway production for box office mojo. But luscious as her singing and stage presence are, she's not the star here. Front and center is the London-trained Cynthia Erivo as Celie...Relatively unheralded, she brings stark humanity -- and an astonishing voice -- to the role of the abused young woman dismissed as ugly and worthless who somehow manages to persevere long enough to have her radiant light recognized.

There are times you forget Jennifer Hudson also is onstage...Doyle's pacing in the first act is so swift that there's little time to breathe as misery seems to visit Celie without release...Things loosen up in a more airy second act...Hudson as the hedonistic Shug Avery rushes her lines a tad but no one will care when she opens her mouth to deliver the title song...There is purity and astounding horse power in her voice.

The musical blossoms into a classic...Celie's journey has a clearer sense of direction than before, but she doesn't have to travel it alone. Erivo is supported by a mighty sisterhood of performers: Jennifer Hudson as Shug, Mister's mistress and Celie's lover; Danielle Brooks as the seemingly indomitable Sofia; Patrice Covington as the exuberant Squeak; Carrie Compere, Bre Jackson and Rema Webb as a trio of gossipy church ladies.

It happened at a recent preview of ""The Color Purple"" and, chances are, it's happening every night. Edging toward the finale of the show, Cynthia Erivo, a British actress in her thrilling Broadway debut, lays into a song...full of defiant realization for her character Celie after a lifetime of insult, drudgery and self-sacrifice...Director John Doyle's passionate, scaled-down, streamlined, low-frills revival of the 2005 musical adaptation of Alice Walker's 1982 Pulitzer-winning novel is not priming us for big musical-theater gestures.

Cynthia Erivo, a Brit who's unknown in New York, is spectacular as the beleaguered Celie, who loses her innocence, self-esteem and all else thanks to men in her life...she sings with such clear, honest openness that you feel everything she's feeling -- and she feels a lot.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,12/10/2015

Any way you stage it, the musical version of the film version of Alice Walker's novel is an exercise in treacly feel-good sentimentality, but Mr. Doyle's scaled-down, ruthlessly cut version makes the best possible case for ""The Color Purple."" He has turned it into a concert-style let-us-tell-you-a-story show whose only set pieces are wooden chairs and woven baskets, in the process stripping away all the whiz-bang aspects of Gary Griffin's 2005 staging, which now appear in retrospect to have obscured the virtues (such as they are) of ""The Color Purple.""",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,12/10/2015

The shocker is that she can sing -- and when she belts the take-no-guff anthem ""Hell No!"" you want to shout back ""Hell yeah!"" ""The Color Purple: The Musical"" is far from perfect. Marsha Norman's adaptation of Alice Walker's novel takes tons of shortcuts, careening from scene to scene at full speed.

This performance places Shelly firmly and dominatingly at the center of ""Glengarry,"" which needs to be a tight ensemble piece. There's not much the other actors can do to compete with or even balance Mr. Pacino's grandstanding...The production's strange combination of comic shtick and existential weariness makes it feel rather like a long-running sitcom being filmed before a live audience that knows its characters' signature tics and flourishes by heart.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,12/08/2012
Glengarry Glen Ross,6,Theater Review: 'Glengarry Glen Ross',"David Mamet's 1984 Pulitzer Prize winner ""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" about ruthless salesmen, can grab you by the throat and punch you in the gut. It's a powerful play. But the new Broadway production just gives you a nudge. That's better than nothing in this season of mostly meaningless Broadway plays, but you'd expect more from a production that delayed the opening a month. A lot of that has to do with Al Pacino, the star of the show. Pacino is a terrific actor and gave a riveting performance two years ago in ""The Merchant of Venice."" But as Shelly Levene, a dinosaur who can't close a deal, Pacino seems small and insignificant. As much as Pacino resorts to trademark tricks — bugging his eyes, talking in falsetto, sticking out his gut — he's not able to generate much empathy for Shelly, who represents the price of American commerce. As the result, the play simmers when it wants to boil.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,12/08/2012
Glengarry Glen Ross,6,Glengarry Glen Ross: Theater Review,"First seen on Broadway in 1984, Mamet's tight-as-a-drum drama should still retain its bite, but it never quite catches fire in this latest revival. Allowing the play to be twisted from an ensemble piece into a platform for Al Pacino, an actor not averse to showboating, director Daniel Sullivan and his producers have done a disservice to the Pulitzer-winning work....The production packs some heat in the performances of Bobby Cannavale and John C. McGinley, along with assured work from David Harbour, Richard Schiff, Jeremy Shamos and Murphy Guyer. But their collective efforts are not enough to make the somewhat routine staging crackle....Even in an underpowered production, these guys are fascinating specimens to watch as they navigate the vicious fray of office politics. The same goes for Mamet's tautly structured play. With its fusillade exchanges and fat-free set-up, it remains a model of dramatic economy. Too bad its nasty punch is a tad soft here.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,12/08/2012

He will do this, beyond all bounds of common practice, for the next two hours, a choice at once interesting, sweet and weird...An hour or two later, you come to see that the production has its high points, its entertainments, its solid performances and there is nothing herein to kill the appeal of this brilliantly constructed and spectacularly theatrical play...But this production...ultimately does not succeed pretty much for the same reasons that the last Broadway production of Mamet's ""American Buffalo"" did not work out. Although hardly an everyman in whom we can see ourselves, Pacino's Shelly is certainly playful, unpredictable and rhythmically impulsive...Pacino certainly captures Shelly's vulnerability, even if he channels much of that into eccentricity.

The latter, a thrashing cri de couer of a boy considering suicide, should be among the show's most powerful moments, but here falls flat.

In two years of building the show, Schreck has crafted a powerful argument that uses everything at hand: legal analysis, a dive into history, a consuming rage at sexual-assault statistics and her own very personal reasoning. (There's a scary and hilarious audio recording of Supreme Court justices that's worth the price of admission.)

King Kong,4,'King Kong': Theater Review,"To quote the title of an R&B hit by early '70s girl group Honey Cone, ""One Monkey Don't Stop No Show."" Except that in King Kong, it most definitely does. In fact, that monstrous ape, able to cup an aspiring Hollywood starlet in one giant paw, pretty much is the show in this otherwise blundering musical, in which a low-wattage cast gamely trudges through one embarrassing number or cliché-ridden book scene after another. Even if the star puppet might be better suited for an arena spectacle or theme-park attraction, you can't take your eyes off this technological marvel, not least for its incredible facial expressiveness.

King Kong,4,‘King Kong’ Broadway Review: Giant Puppet Upstages the Mere Humans,"The big ape deserves a Tony. He's not only the star of ""King Kong,"" which opened Thursday at the Broadway Theatre. He's also a damned good actor, too - one who shows a wide range of emotion while running through the jungle, fighting off a giant serpent, being gassed by crass capitalists or climbing up the Empire State Building. That he's a puppet only makes his performance all the more riveting. But he/it has an advantage over the human actors on stage.

King Kong looks down on its huckster villain, film director Carl (Eric William Morris, overplaying an unplayable role), for taking an awesome creature and surrounding it with mediocrity for a gawking New York audience-but that's exactly what this production does itself.

King Kong,3,BWW Review: KING KONG: It Was Inept Writing Killed The Musical,"Though loaded with flat, stilted dialogue, the biggest mistake of Thorne's book is to take away the tragic aspects of the film's two main characters, sapping them of empathy. The earnest and honest filmmaker Carl Denham is now a heartless villain who cons people with promises of fame and wealth. Ann Darrow, the role that made Fay Wray a star, is no longer fighting to survive the Depression -- stealing food to keep from fainting from hunger -- and willing to join Denham on his film shoot out of desperation. Now she's a young hopeful coming to New York with dreams of stardom and thinking this gig might be her big break. Unlike Wray, who screamed in terror for half the picture, this Ann reacts to the beast's roars by roaring right back at him and trying to relate on a deeper level.

King Kong,2,King Kong review – Broadway kills the beast in monstrously bad musical,"But it's bountifully clear, from the first forgettable lyrics to the last gratuitous lines that no hominid involved in this glitzy shambles has any idea what to do with him. As a feat of stagecraft and structural engineering, Kong is cool. A creature with the delts of a prize fighter, the potbelly of a toddler, a possible addiction to Crest White Strips and the external genitalia of a Ken doll (the ""he"" is provisional), he is brought to animatronic life by the King's Company, a troupe of 10 black-clad puppeteers who tug his marionette strings in some version of a maypole dance, and four voodoo operators, who control his facial expressions from a booth at the back of the theater. Put it all together and you have a double-decker bus who looks like he's lost badly at beer pong. It's unlikely he'll sign at the stage door.",Guardian,Alexis Soloski,11/08/2018

Its attempt to celebrate the resilience of its ""bad-ass"" star and her half-century career of highs and lows rarely rises above that TV series' taste for cliches, corn and cheese. Despite an icon with attitude, an armful of pop tunes and a can-do cast, the script never quite finds a satisfying style - or a genuine heart - as a winning stage musical.

We are told a dozen times that Cher is ""shy,"" and her mother's advice-""The song makes you strong""-is repeated more than once. But unlike the songs in, say, Beautiful, Cher's actual hits can't support that task: They are likeable but skimpy pop ditties. Rick Elice's script responds to this challenge by skipping past most of them quickly: We hear only snippets before the musical hurries on to some new montage, narration or set change.

The Cher Show,6,The Cher Show review – Broadway musical is a mixed bag of pop excess,"Cher's fandom is assured. The exuberant, occasionally tacky jukebox musical that tells her life story is more faltering. The Cher Show, like last year's Donna Summer musical, requires three actors (and the occasional dancer) to play one jukebox queen. Micaela Diamond is Babe, Teal Wicks is Lady, Stephanie J Block is Star. (That trio sounds cheerier than Maiden, Mother, Crone.) Together they describe the evolution of Cherilyn Sarkisian from southern California ugly duckling to the black swan entertainment queen. This is a straightforward story of female empowerment, though, as crafted by an all-male creative team, it sometimes feels more like a compilation of girl-power pep talks than an individual woman's singular journey.",Guardian,Alexis Soloski,12/03/2018
The Cher Show,6,Theater Review: How Over-the-Top Should The Cher Show Be?,"I'm okay with the real thing, and even with nostalgia in YouTube-size bites - but not as the only fuel in the tank when you're trying to do a play. Put Cher, or even three Chers, on Broadway and not only do you in fact decrease the potential for expected spectacle - you've also got to try to make her into, well, theater. And that requires more than costumes, even costumes by Bob Mackie. It requires more than several good Cher impressions (Diamond, Wicks, and Block are all doing their best Janice-from-the-Electric-Mayhem voices, and Block especially sounds great belting out the brassy, vibrato-heavy hits). It requires more than wigs and wings and sailors and celebrities and tangoing gypsies and hoedown-ing cowboys. The problem isn't that it's all too much.

Sadly that's not the case with ""The Cher Show,"" the maddening mishmash of a new musical that opened on Monday at the Neil Simon Theater.

And the production's embrace of cartoonishness works against the sentimental effects it sometimes reaches for, especially since we have little reason to care about Jeremy one way or the other; Roland, who was terrific as the needling sidekick in Dear Evan Hansen, sings well but doesn't project the sensitivity that might help fill out his role.

The director Matthew Warchus, who directed Carvel as the hideous headmistress in Matilda (for which he won a Tony), affectionately calls him a ""nose-putty actor"" - and it's true that there's something refreshingly broad and tricksterish about his style. Brits in general are more comfortable as character actors, knowingly playing games with their own bodies and voices. Americans tend to want to be serious heroes - we get stuck in our heads and our feels.

With ""The Ferryman,"" Mr. Butterworth is again assessing the chokehold of a nation's past on its present. But now it is Northern Ireland at the height of the politically fraught period known as the Troubles. (We hear radio reports of the of the dying Irish Republican hunger striker in the Maze prison.)

Even though, when I stopped to think about it, at least three different elements of the story's final catastrophic 60 seconds left me wondering, ""Wait, but why?"" In a sense, set and costume designer Rob Howell's rendering of the Carneys' farmhouse, with its barrage of meticulous detail and its absurdly outsize proportions, is the perfect metaphor for the play itself: It's a head-trippy presentation of rich, authentic-seeming texture inside a romanticized, larger-than-life box - a gourmet meal by a very clever chef that somehow gives us the same uneasy satisfaction as Lucky Charms.

Network,9,Broadway Review: ‘Network’ With Bryan Cranston,"Bryan Cranston, who could do no wrong as Walter White in ""Breaking Bad"" (and a Tony winner for ""All the Way""), burrows deep under the skin of Howard Beale here: the furrowed brow, the anxious angularity, the searching eyes all indicate a person in extremis. But it's the voice that really makes us feel - and fear - for Beale. Beneath the mellifluous tones of Cranston's professional ""newsman"" delivery we can hear the agitated rasp and incipient howl of a person who's cracking up.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,12/06/2018
Network,9,‘Network’ starring Bryan Cranston review: A knockout take on the classic movie,"Yet even if this ""Network"" doesn't entirely hang together, it's still a fabulous piece of entertainment, directed and performed with verve and showmanship. Just about every directorial choice here - the clocks that count down to Beale's news broadcasts; the applause signs demanding the audience's interaction; a final scene magic trick straight out of ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" - manages to be audacious without feeling show-offy. If you're going to transfer a movie to the stage, this is exactly how to do it, by respecting both forms and then taking a sledgehammer to them. Let the pieces land thrillingly where they may.",NJ.com,Christopher Kelly,12/06/2018
Network,7,‘Network’ and ‘The Cher Show’ Reviews: Broadway’s Recycling Bin,"In the case of ""Network,"" Lee Hall's stage version of the 1976 Paddy Chayefsky-Sidney Lumet film about a network anchorman (played in the film by Peter Finch and onstage by Bryan Cranston) who cracks up midway through the evening news and starts telling the truth, the frosting has been whipped up by Ivo van Hove, Europe's most pretentious stage director. Working in close collaboration with Jan Versweyveld, the scenic and lighting designer, and Tal Yarden, the video designer, Mr. Van Hove has given us a TV-screens-and-Plexiglas production that looks thoroughly postmodern. The catch is that Mr. Hall's script, set in 1975, is a faithful adaptation of Chayefsky's screenplay, a once-prescient satire of the dumbed-down future of broadcast news. All of Chayefsky's predictions having long since come to pass, ""Network"" is thus a musty period piece: The bomb has already gone off.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,12/06/2018
Network,6,Network,"With its continual sensory overload and its darkly vague intimations about populism and corporate power, this Network certainly looks cool. But it’s beyond cool: It’s icy. We seem intended to nod our heads and think about how prescient it all was—the mob appeal of anger, a mention of Saudi Arabia—but then to think no more. Network isn’t galvanizing, it’s numbing: emptily flashy in its condemnation of empty flash, inhuman in its wan defense of humanity. It has a superb TV star and a killer catch phrase, but behind the sound and fury is only a shadow of significance.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,12/06/2018

That sincerity comes through in ""Kinky Boots""...The leading players here - notably Stark Sands, Billy Porter and Annaleigh Ashford - pick up on the trademark Lauper mix of sentimentality and eccentricity, but each makes it his or her own. Under Mr. Mitchell's precise and affectionate direction, they do what you want performers in musicals to do: they define specific characters by the way they sing and move.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,04/04/2013

True, the second half is almost completely unnecessary, the English accents are laughable and the footwear puns are relentless. But who cares? This is a big ol' sweet love story about sons, the families we make and red patent leather...the real star is Porter, who delivers a touching, sassy, nuanced performance, often in 8-inch heels.

Cyndi Lauper's taken those themes to heart, too, in songs such as ""True Colors,"" so it's no surprise that her first score, ""Kinky Boots,"" finds her at ease on Broadway.

Kinky Boots,8,STAGE REVIEW Kinky Boots,"Whenever Porter is on stage, though, he elevates a musical that might otherwise seem like a club-ready mash-up of La Cage aux Folles, The Full Monty, Billy Elliot, and Cabaret. Porter displays remarkable vocal versatility, making showstoppers out of three very different but equally catchy Lauper tunes: the disco song 'Sex Is in the Heel,' the affecting ballad 'I'm Not My Father's Son,' and the Whitney Houston-like anthem 'Hold Me in Your Heart.'

And that distinguished history, judiciously coupled with a book by the famously droll and direct Fierstein, is riveted into the stiletto heels dancing through industrial Britain in this show - a witty, striking and emotionally centered movie-to-musical transfer about a down-at-heel Northampton shoe factory that reinvents itself by making reinforced footwear for hefty drag queens.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/04/2013

That news -- and it is very good indeed -- is Cyndi Lauper, who makes a smashing Broadway debut as composer and lyricist...Lauper, unlike many recent theatrical pop-crossovers, changes her sounds to illuminate each character without losing her identity...Lauper and Fierstein are never onstage, but their spirits elevate a very conventional show with wit and sweetness.",Newsday,Linda Winer,04/04/2013

Porter brings tough sass, wounded dignity and husky vocal authority to a part he has seemingly been training all his life to play; and as Charlie's lovelorn underling, the sweetly tart Annaleigh Ashford-she of the perfectly timed comic take-adds another stolen show to her rap sheet.

It's never boring; it's never shocking; you are likely to leave entirely entertained and satisfied. Can't argue with that.

A proudly idiosyncratic pop priestess since the early '80s, she's always been way more real than her contemporary, Madonna, let alone such 21st century descendants as Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj. Rocking the thrift-store chic and subjecting her hair to chemical torture, Lauper has made a career out of celebrating her extravagant individuality and everybody else's with the unpretentious chutzpah of a true-blue Queens girl.

Yes, Harvey Fierstein's funny book is a bit too bald, Cyndi Lauper's catchy songs are more lyrically repetitive than they should be, and director-choreographer Jerry Mitchell slights character and story in favor of splashy production numbers.

Some of the themes and machinations may seem off the conveyor belt--a device that's integral to one of the numbers--but when a musical is accessorized with stagecraft like this, one learns acceptance.

Kinky Boots,6,Theater Review: 'Kinky Boots',"At first glance, ""Kinky Boots"" would appear to contain all the ingredients of a hit musical...So why does this musical, which looks and acts like a crowd-pleaser, still feel so unsatisfying? The biggest problem is that Lauper's electric-pop songs are generic. Furthermore, Jerry Mitchell's production resembles a slick but uninspired rehash of all his earlier shows such as ""The Full Monty"" (the working class environment), ""La Cage aux Folles"" (flashy drag queens and Harvey Fierstein's one-liners) and ""Hairspray"" (a spunky spirit). But there is a saving grace to ""Kinky Boots"" and it's Billy Porter, who imbues the role of Lola with fierce diva attitude in a Tony-worthy performance. 2.5 stars",amNY,Matt Windman,04/04/2013
Kinky Boots,6,Review: Cyndi Lauper and Harvey Fierstein Don Their “Kinky Boots”,"If you're going to stage a musical about fathers and sons, expectations and disappointment, you couldn't ask for more promising shepherds than rock icon Cyndi Lauper and four-time Tony winner Harvey Fierstein. Separately, each has created some of the more affirming material in the self-acceptance canon (think ""True Colors,"" and ""La Cage aux Folles""). What the duo has conjured together in ""Kinky Boots,"" which has just opened at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre, is a vibrant, if choppy tale about carving your own identity, with bold, brassy music that delivers on its promise, and a story that, like so much from this genre, is often predictable.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,04/04/2013
Kinky Boots,6,Kinky Boots – review,"We can credit costume designer Gregg Barnes with the boots - they really are luscious. But similar originality evades most of the songs, which, though tuneful enough, fade from the mind as soon as the last note has sounded. A few exceptions are The History of Wrong Guys, a clever girl/dumb choices number milked gleefully by Annaleigh Ashford, and I'm Not My Father's Son, a duet for Sands and Porter. Most of the others, even those that promise well, ultimately come across as generic, accomplishing little in terms of revealing character or driving plot. Certainly there's nothing to rival the poignancy of Time After Time, or even the daffy joy of She Bop.

The integration of David Cromer's intimate and sensitive direction; David Yazbek's Middle-Eastern flavored score, much of which is performed onstage by cast members; and Itamar Moses' book, which hews closely to the original screenplay, is so seamless that it is virtually impossible to pick apart.

Some of these humans who have lost things and who are lost themselves happen to be Arab, and some happen to be Israeli.

Now Anastasia has reappeared on Broadway, the centerpiece of a new musical that works quite delightfully when the star is center stage, and struggles mightily when she is off in the wings, where the charming Christy Altomare spends far too long.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/24/2017
Anastasia,7,‘Anastasia’ review,"It could be observed in terms of the physical production that nothing succeeds like excess. The drop dead gorgeous costumes are by Linda Cho. It is a good thing that the Russian court ensemble featured in the opening of the musical are brought back multiple times in ghostly re-enactments because we needed more than one look at them. This excellent ensemble variously deployed as members of the Ballet Russe, White Russian society and revolutionary thugs execute choreography by Peggy Hickey that is always mood and period appropriate. Alexander Dodge's set creates a multi-purpose gracious framing for extensive projections by Aaron Rhyne. But here once again neither a subtle nor consistent aesthetic applies. Some of the visuals are alluringly abstract while others are hyper realistic. Acres of saturated red backdrop places us in the revolution, in case we had any doubt. Snow falls and stars twinkle and flowers bloom in the eventual spring so copiously it is as though we have detoured to Oz. In aural complement, it often feels as though the show is scored like a film, such as when a chorus helpfully underpins a tense moment with a drawn gun.",Broadway News,Elizabeth Bradley,04/24/2017
Anastasia,7,‘Anastasia’ review: A vapid journey to the past on Broadway,"Now ""Anastasia,"" inspired by the 1956 Ingrid Bergman film but mostly the 1997 animation, does have plenty of snow - lovely fat snowflakes that flit like fireflies behind the semicircle of graceful windows (designed by Alexander Dodge) that twirl and reveal scenes from St. Petersburg to Paris. This one also has a score by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, who wrote the music for the cartoon that catapulted the song, ""Journey to the Past,"" to pop stardom. For the Broadway version, they have teamed up with playwright Terrence McNally, their collaborator for the far superior ""Ragtime."" More power ballads have been added to the pretty but dispiritingly predictable story of Anastasia, the princess who, as rumor once had it, may have escaped the revolution's firing squad as a child in 1918.",Newsday,Linda Winer,04/24/2017
Anastasia,6,"Review: ‘Anastasia,’ a Russian Princess With an Identity Crisis","Those mid-20th-century musicals that must've sounded like a good idea at the time, but tend to be remembered today only by hard-core aficionados of the genre. They were frothy but earnest shows, set in distant times and foreign lands, with titles like ""Mata Hari"" and ""Pleasures and Palaces."" Such shows had a hard time squeezing their epic-size selves into the corsets of book-musical conventions, and they usually died young. I don't foresee a similar fate for ""Anastasia,"" which originated at Hartford Stage in Connecticut and is directed by Darko Tresnjak (a Tony winner for his ingenious staging of ""A Gentleman's Guide to Love & Murder""), with choreography both stately and antic by Peggy Hickey. The cartoon version from 1997 is very fondly remembered by people who saw it as tweens, especially girls. Its Ahrens-Flaherty score included the breakout hit ""Journey to the Past,"" which is repurposed here and sung ardently by Ms. Altomare. So ""Anastasia"" may well tap into the dewy-eyed demographic that made ""Wicked"" such an indestructible favorite of female adolescents. Those without such nostalgic insulation are likely to find this ""Anastasia"" a chore.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,04/24/2017

Anastasia,6,"Theater Review: Anastasia, Staged in Vain","It bewilders me that in making stage musicals from animated or otherwise fantastical movies, adaptors seem to think they can remain outside history. Perhaps the creative team of Anastasia held meetings whose agenda items included such items as Finessing the Romanovs. (There is exactly one reference to their possible contribution to Russia's problems.) You see why this must have seemed necessary; otherwise, Anastasia's self-discovery could not be the climax of her hero's journey, and her beautiful tiara might seem a tad undeserved, even to the Fanastasias. All her sorrowful warbling about the past - well sung, if little else, by Christy Altomare - would be sickening instead of heart-catching.

But then why does this Russian girl know so much about the Romanovs' pet cat and why is there a diamond the size of the Ritz sewn into her rag of an overcoat? Also unexplained is where Anya/Anastasia learned to jump from trains a la Tom Cruise and defend herself (and her boyfriend) by kicking men in the nuts. No Disney princess ever did that before!

Choir Boy,8,Review: Raising a Joyful New Voice in Tarell Alvin McCraney’s ‘Choir Boy’,"This is the first of many plot points that feel both obvious and false, like pieces of the wrong puzzle ham-hammered into place. Too frequently, information that if delivered sooner would have forestalled the plot completely is delivered hastily later, as if to sweep it under a dorm bed. In any case, Trip Cullman's tonally blurry staging for the Manhattan Theater Club does not help you understand what to make of such logical inconsistencies, though it is at least swift enough to keep you from dwelling on them. But a similar problem eats away at the credibility of most of the characters as written. Two of the choir boys, Junior (Nicholas L. Ashe of ""Queen Sugar"") and David (Caleb Eberhardt), get approximately one trait each. Junior is pleasantly dim; David is tortured by something you'll see coming a mile away.",New York Times,Jesse Green,01/08/2019

And the issues that arise in the piece do have a touch of familiarity. What isn't familiar, though, is placing a young gay man of color - one who feels he has nothing to hide - at the center of it all, considerably raising the significance of placing a play like Choir Boy in front of Broadway audiences.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,01/08/2019
Choir Boy,8,Choir Boy,"The ending has been revised since Manhattan Theatre Club first presented it Off Broadway in 2013 with much of the same cast-Pope, Ashe, and the excellent Chuck Cooper and Austin Pendleton as adults at the school-but many of the changes are not improvements; the denouement is somehow more explanatory yet less clear. (A pivotal scene of violence is a misstep in Trip Cullman's mostly sure-footed staging.)

Choir Boy,8,'Choir Boy': Theater Review,"Many of the characters are cut from familiar molds - the effeminate gay kid torn between self-affirmation and self-protection; the privileged bully with his own burdens; the closeted loner crippled by anxieties; the sensitive jock. And the microcosm of an exclusive boarding school has often served in theater and film as a prism through which to examine traits prevalent in society at large. But the specificity of a black middle-class milieu, plus the writer's sharp ear for dialogue and his observations on class, race and sexuality, give McCraney's play distinctive qualities that outweigh its more conventional aspects.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,01/08/2019
Choir Boy,8,Choir Boy review – Tarell Alvin McCraney hits high notes on Broadway,"There are other tensions operating here, too. McCraney typically layers his stories with myth and archetype. But here he's abandoned most of his poetic and thematic flourishes (barring an on-the-nose speech in which Pharus discusses the beauty of spirituals), working instead in a more naturalistic style that while friendly to Broadway can sometimes feel a little pat. The short scenes tumble on speedily, but it's really only in the clefts between scenes, when the young men step forward, not necessarily in character, and deliver forceful, emotive versions of Rockin' in Jerusalem or Rainbow Round My Shoulder, that the play takes on a real intensity. In these moments Choir Boy ascends and its choirboys achieve, as long as the notes hold, what feels like freedom.",Guardian,Alexis Soloski,01/08/2019

Demos-Brown, a Florida trial attorney, writes what he knows but breaks no new ground and offers no solutions.

The two ex-spouses fight as proxies for their identities: Scott argues Kendra has encouraged the kid to be ""too black""; Kendra says the kid was mad at having been abandoned by his rich, white dad. The African-American cop is caught in the middle. The piece wrestles with crucial issues, and it's performed with enough intensity by Pasquale and Washington under Kenny Leon's theme-based direction that they effectively collide with your own prejudices, whoever you might be.

American Son,6,American Son,"We don't get many ancient Greek tragedies on Broadway. Tastes have changed, and what we think of as dramatic has shifted into different patterns. So Christopher Demos-Brown's American Son seems like a play from another time. It basically consists of two-person arguments, interspersed with messenger speeches: Something has happened offstage, and we wait with the characters to find out what it is. The rhetoric is heavy-handed, the grief and fear are unremitting, the brushstrokes are asphalt-thick, and there's no subtlety in either the characterizations or the narrative structure. In other words, Demos-Brown hasn't written a particularly skillful modern drama. But when the fate of a nation was at stake, Euripides wrote plays like this too.",TimeOut NY,Helen Shaw,11/04/2018

American Son,2,Theater Review: The Good Intentions of American Son,"American Son has power behind it: Shonda Rhimes, Jada Pinkett Smith, Dwayne Wade, and the show's star, Kerry Washington, are on its long, glittery list of producers. It has its serious sights set on a subject of indisputable tragic weight: the unjustifiable killing of unarmed black men in America by unaccountable police officers. It also has a contrived, TV-ish script peopled by one-note characters and peppered with amateurish flourishes. Its playwright, Christopher Demos-Brown, a writer and lawyer who runs a practice in Miami, seems to be positioning himself as a kind of John Grisham for the stage, and its director, Kenny Leon, can't push the material past its inherent paperback flatness. Derek McLane's bulky, photo-real Miami police-station set, with real rain falling outside the upstage windows, tells us all we need to know about tone: There's nothing remotely theatrical about this play, no reason for it to be a play at all - save that we retain a kind of anxious cultural cachet about drama. Putting something on stage seems to aggrandize it, make it more serious-minded and more luxurious, closer to opera than Netflix. But the truth is that contemporary plays like American Son are simply imitations of the shows on Netflix-or, in this case, NBC-and pale ones at that, because unlike our age's spate of fascinating television, these plays want to be something they're not.

That's not to say that this saucy, boisterous musical doesn't have a brainy side, starting with its ambitious crossbreeding of four time periods: It grafts a 2010s queer sensibility onto songs from the 1980s-by the all-girl pop-punk quintet the Go-Go's (plus two hits from lead singer Belinda Carlisle's solo career)-and fits them into a 16th-century story that is set in ancient Greece. The dialogue, in iambic pentameter liberally sprinkled with thou and thee, contrasts amusingly with the unornamented lyrics of such go-to Go-Go's bops as ""Vacation,"" ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" and ""We Got the Beat.""",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,07/26/2018

""Under my supervision,"" says Gynecia to her chastened husband, ""I predict a gentler man will over time evolve."" She's not just talking about Basilius: In Head Over Heels, the future isn't female per se, but it's definitely not male either. Where gender, love, and governance are concerned, the future is free - free of the old definitions, the old order, the old beat.

Everyone else in the cast takes care of business, and if you really, really like the Go-Go's, you might possibly find the results tolerable.

Springsteen On Broadway,8,Review: Bruce Springsteen's Broadway Show Is an Intimate Triumph,"It's clear from the beginning that this is nothing like a typical latter-day Springsteen concert, where set lists can vary wildly from night to night and Bruce often has little to say between songs. There's no room for his usual athleticism here - Springsteen just shuffles a few feet between a piano on stage left and a microphone at center stage. The intensity is, instead, emotional, as Springsteen digs hard into the bedrock of his life story, and ours: childhood, religion, work, death. The performance is hard to categorize. It's not a concert; not a typical one-man-show; certainly not a Broadway musical. But it is one of the most compelling and profound shows by a rock musician in recent memory.",Rolling Stone,Andy Greene,10/12/2017
Springsteen On Broadway,8,Review: Bruce Springsteen Comes to Broadway,"On Broadway isn't haunted by its ghosts. It's an act of penitent commemoration. Near the end of the night, Springsteen recalls a trip back to his hometown, which, for all his signature drive and wanderlust, he can get to in a ten-minute trip from where he lives now. He performs a strange benediction for a big tree he used to climb as a kid, upon learning it was recently removed from the property. The physical form is gone, but the comfort and support he associated with it will last forever. The Broadway show might serve the same purpose for fans. It's a rare opportunity to see the man up close in one of the smallest rooms he'll ever play. As with any Springsteen stage performance, you learn that his voice and personality are much bigger than the body housing them.",Vulture,Craig Jenkins,10/12/2017
Springsteen On Broadway,8,Review: Bruce Springsteen's 'intimate and personal' Broadway debut,"The two-hour program is also, in its distinctly intimate, understated fashion, an affirmation of the exuberant showmanship and vivid storytelling that Springsteen's rock and roll shares with musical theatre.

They're torn between the seduction of Bernhardt's myth and the more unknowable essence of her humanity - between the compulsion to hold up this spectacular woman from history as both an artistic legend and a feminist hero, and the less flashy, much more personal impulse to tell the story of a woman of the theater who's wrestling with ego, uncertainty, mortality, and Shakespeare. I know which story interests me more, but Bernhardt/Hamlet never fully makes the leap. Instead, it spends its time plucking low-hanging fruit and getting its characters into arguments that feel like cul-de-sacs.

Moritz von Stuelpnagel's staging for the Roundabout has a handsome rotating set by Beowulf Boritt and capable performances not only by McTeer, who is incapable of being dull, but a strong supporting cast that includes Matthew Saldovar as an Art Nouveau poster artist, Nick Westrate as Bernhardt's son and Ito Aghayere as Rostand's plaintive wife.

This American premiere also is underpaced: it's written to move with the speed of the black careening toward triumph, to ricochet with the excitement of the break, but instead you get too many pockets of air.

The actor best known as Captain America brings plenty of cocky swagger, his thumbs hooked into his utility belt like an Old West cowboy with a bushy mustache to match, but his assured performance never aims to be a star turn.

Trying to create that idyllic vision in the real world, in a rustic outpost in the forest in the second act, is an experiment doomed to failure.

It's nevertheless an enjoyable venture, with the sumptuousness of director John Dove's production helping to mask the flaws. The elegant visuals by designer Jonathan Fensom and costume coordinator Lorraine Ebdon-Price (accented by hair and wigs by Campbell Young Associates), are illuminated by lighting designer Paul Russell with candles placed at footlights and hanging from chandeliers. The playing area is surrounded by two levels of onstage seating for both audience members and music director Robert Howarth's ensemble of musicians playing van Kampen's arrangement on period instruments.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,12/17/2017

And then there's Rylance. (Remember Rylance? It's a review about Rylance.) He compels us to watch him in close-up, because he has the star's gift of playing to the cheap seats without actually playing to the cheap seats. A sixteenth-inch twitch of the shoulder conveys the world-weariest of shrugs. The slight escalation of those drawbridge eyebrows rings louder than any shout of protest. And the throwaway line, like the subtle gesture, penetrates as keenly as any of Richard III's mocking asides.

It is also a celebration of the power of music to overcome emotional and mental instability. Rylance, who excels at playing sad and strange characters, gives a full-bodied and endearing performance that combines volatile behavior and over-the-top comedy with gentle contemplation.

Whenever van Kampen's dialogue turns florid, he gives it a flat modern reading, and throws in an F-bomb. Elsewhere, he vocally stumbles and pauses, and lets dull phrases wither in his mouth for added comic effect. Meanwhile, Grove's queen suffers without giving much range to her desperation other than an occasional eyeball roll or nostril flare. And Crane's castrato remains glum, especially when Davies is singing. Dove delivers an appropriately spectacular entrance for the singing Farinelli at the end of Act 1, but for the most part his direction of the two Farinellis is a major waste of potentially golden opportunities.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,12/17/2017

It is, like Farinelli's operas, an entertainment-and one specifically for Rylance to play with all manner of facial expressions and tones. If the story palls, look around you. Director John Dove uses every bit of the theater, with actors going up and down the aisles, and musicians, led by Robert Howarth on harpsichord, placed in the gods. Jonathan Fensom's design is your own visual test for the evening: The theater is lushly paneled, as if we are indeed at court, with descending screens signifying different settings. But the other bit of truly crucial magic is Paul Russell's lighting. Six chandeliers filled with candles act as the stage's main illumination. There are candles all around the stage in boxes. Where is the other light coming from? Seemingly from the existing, beautiful lighting of the Belasco, which is variously raised and lowered in intensity. Perhaps Russell has hidden other lighting genius more surreptitiously. Whatever, your eyes and ears will leave Farinelli happy indeed.",Daily Beast,Tim Teeman,12/17/2017

That's a pity, since director John Dove has taken such pains to re-create the heavily gilded style of the formal Baroque setting of this production, which originated at Shakespeare's Globe Theater in 2015.

But the drama, I'm afraid, doesn't match the rest of the evening. The plot is intriguingly promising, yes; but the execution is merely functional. After a while, we begin to think that the play is built around the star's performing strengths, as opposed to the performance being built to support the play. Rylance's strengths are myriad, of course; and his wife/collaborator knows every trick he has in his overflowing sack. Sure, why not give him a role which displays them all? Only we feel like we are watching him display them all. And we know, from years of watching excellent actors, that they are likely at their best when they are not simply playing to their strengths. Rylance is delightful and delicious and exuberant and altogether lovable here; but we are seeing the actor, not a dramatically-realized version of Philippe V.

The play's bright creative stroke is having Sam Crane, who's wonderfully sympathetic, act the part of Carlo, and sweet-voiced countertenor Iestyn Davies sing as Farinelli.

If House of Cards succeeded on the strength of clipped dialogue smoothly set off by Kevin Spacey's conspiratorial asides to the audience, the dramaturgy fails Willimon here.

The Parisian Woman,4,The Parisian Woman,"One potentially salutary effect of the 2016 presidential election, people on the left have been nervously saying, is that it might encourage a rebirth of oppositional political art. Beau Willimon's The Parisian Woman picks up that challenge and fumbles it. Loosely adapted from a 19th-century French play by Henry Becque, the play has been rewritten since its 2013 California premiere to specifically target the current administration, though Trump's name is not mentioned aloud until the last five minutes. Yet Willimon-who mapped the political sphere succesfully in Farragut North and Netflix's House of Cards-seems stymied by his project. A political thriller stuffed into a sex comedy's dress, the play bulges in all the wrong places.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,11/30/2017

Leguizamo's one-man show features the performer as a version of himself, revising the way American history is typically taught to elevate the heroes of his own ethnic background, and to give his son the chance to feel pride in where and what he comes from. Leguizamo, who was born in Colombia, has long been a wild stage presence, an actor of enough range to keep an entire theater enraptured through his own musings, impressions, and literal pratfalls. (Previous one-man shows have netted him Obie and Drama Desk awards.)

Instead of playing ""get the guests"", as Martha and George do, the guests here seem on a mission to ""get the hosts"", in more ways than one.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,5,‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’ review: Saccharine overload,"For a musical about the wonder of pure imagination, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is bizarrely lacking in it. The show does have Christian Borle as Willy Wonka, the mysterious chocolate-making genius created by Roald Dahl in 1964, then indelibly embodied by Gene Wilder in the 1971 movie and (a bit less indelibly) Johnny Depp on screen in 2005. Alas, especially in the long and slow first act, it's almost painful to watch Borle, a master of endearing virtuosity, work so hard to sell charm that simply isn't in the script, the music and too much of the staging.",Newsday,Linda Winer,04/23/2017
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,4,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"Where did such promising material-gut-renovated after its 2013 London debut-go wrong? Let's start at the top: Eccentric sweets manufacturer Willy Wonka (Christian Borle in fey bully mode) saunters on at the very beginning and tells us he's on a mission to find his replacement. Farewell, dramatic tension! In the movie, the Wonka legend is built up so that when Gene Wilder appears, it's a genuine thrill. Here Borle encourages us to loathe Wonka at our earliest convenience; and we know he's going to favor plucky poor-kid Charlie (Ryan Foust, alternating with two other boys).",TimeOut NY,David Cote,04/23/2017
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,4,'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' has barely a drop of that magic chocolate,"Borle's problems are intensified by the show's decision not to take us to the chocolate factory until intermission, spending all of Act 1 on Charlie's early life, the golden ticket backstory and, weirdly, on Charlie's relationship with the owner of the local candy shop (also played by Borle). This was a truly terrible decision (that candy store guy, who is cold, is not Wonka). It ignores what is on the marquee and also then shoves so much caper-esque plot into Act 2 that the show can't wait around for a moment to focus on what really matters.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/23/2017

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,4,Theater Review: A Willy Wonka That’s Anything but Sweet,"O'Brien rebuilt the New York version as a simpler affair, hoping the audience would use its imagination to fill in the blanks; the result is an unusually dull set design by Mark Thompson and effects that would hardly have seemed special twenty years ago. When Wonka, who has spent much of the first act in disguise as a candy store owner in order to give Borle something to do, reveals himself as the grand wizard of chocolate, the transformation scene involves a crowd gathering around him while he takes off his overcoat. At least the Oompa-Loompas are fun - the first one or two times we meet them. Even so, I doubt this musical would have proved at all likable even if an apt style and thrilling visuals had been found for it.

Especially as produced here, ""Junk"" is an epic, strutting, restless, sexually charged, slam-bang-wham piece of work, something akin to the huge socio-political dramas by the likes of David Hare, produced for years at the National Theatre in London but far less common on this, less reflective side of the Atlantic.

The difference, however, is that J.T.

Director Doug Hughes understands that one of the things Akhtar is doing in Junk is riffing on the Shakespearean history play.

Junk,8,Review: ‘Junk’ teaches a lesson in high finance,"Directed by Doug Hughes at the dizzying pace of speed traders racking up dollars at full froth, and acted by an excellent cast, the play is supremely well-researched, insightful and smart. It is also, on the other hand, so conscientiously thorough in its analysis of its subject that it often feels dense to the point of stultifying. And its ample array of characters - as well as its many-threaded plot - result in a play with greater breadth than depth. As a many-chaptered primer on an ominous turning point in the American economy, it earns full marks.

Junk,7,Review: ‘Junk’ Revives a Go-Go Era of Debt and Duplicity,"And while Mr. Akhtar may have rejected many of the outer trappings of the Wall Street potboiler, he still hews to many of its clichés. That includes a woman being brought to orgasm by the idea of her decrepit lover's financial power, and the antihero Merkin solemnly lying to his wife (Miriam Silverman) in the manner of Michael Corleone. And while the script offers some amusing lessons in shading language with hopeful sounding words to pitch a deal, Mr. Akhtar's dialogue lacks its usual original snap. ""When did money become the thing - the only thing?"" Ms. Lim's character asks in the opening monologue. It's an ever-intriguing question, but you've heard it before.

Characters are variously housed in two rows of Hollywood Squares-like cells, or stalk to the front of a bare, handsomely lit stage-a dark parody of a game show, perhaps-to assail us with wry observations about capitalism. They also inform us, in their brutal, dense financial argot, about what they are about to do to buy, sell, or destroy. Each character feels familiar, each set-up feels familiar, the butch tone and swagger feels familiar.

Taichman, whose work with her actors is sharper in the second act, overplays the first act's saccharine notes, and Paloma Young's costumes fall into the same trap: In 1937, they're crisp and evocative. In 1919, they feel like cotton candy - too sugary, too fluffy, too, well, costume-ish.

Time and the Conways,6,http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/time-conways-theater-review-1047381,"Its inorganic mysticism aside, the play functions more readily as a naturalistic English drawing-room drama of the period, examining the shifting tides of wealth and class, the cost of bourgeois complacency, the failure of political idealism, and the loss of prosperity, position and security for one well-off Yorkshire family between the wars. Those themes provide a kinship to Chekhov, particularly The Cherry Orchard and Three Sisters, though this is a vastly inferior work to those plays, or to Priestley's better-known An Inspector Calls. However, Roundabout at least deserves credit for casting its net beyond the established classics....Time and the Conways is a funny old play, interesting more for its structural adventurousness than its thematic trenchancy.

The Big Numbers seem equally apportioned between LuPone and Ebersole, but none of the songs achieves a necessary emotional payoff, perhaps because the authors are so intent on not letting one overshadow the other.

In fact, it's more about putting faces on. Titans of the beauty industry, Rubinstein and Arden made their names in makeup and put their names on it, but they never actually met-a serious challenge for War Paint's authors. As the show contrasts their personas and careers, it does what it can to keep them in the same frame-sitting, for example, in adjacent booths at a hotel bar-as it cuts back and forth between their stories. (It's like a conjoined-twins relative of Coco, the 1969 Coco Chanel biomusical: Co-Coco.)

This is a musical - really, more of a musical drama - about a band of damaged war veterans who take a stand while competing in a national radio contest in 1945.

And why shouldn't there be, since its troubled main characters include six World War II veterans and the widow of a man killed in combat. Uneasily attempting to be simultaneously a feel-good, swinging musical and a serious depiction of post-traumatic stress, Bandstand is at war with itself.",Hollywood Reporter,Frank Scheck,04/26/2017
Bandstand,6,Why ‘Bandstand’ Is a Broadway Show Lost in Time,"Bandstand is more than competently pulled off. A couple of the musical numbers really do jump, the sets are lavish, the choreography a feat. Cott is far too sweet-natured to pull off the driving ambition and tormented war weariness that Donny is supposed to embody, but Osnes is a real talent, as is Beth Leavel, who plays her mother, and the rest of the cast more than holds their own.",Daily Beast,David Freedlander,04/26/2017
Groundhog Day,9,History Repeats Itself in Gratifying 'Groundhog Day' Musical,"The creators of ""Matilda"" have worked their magic all over again. And again. ""Groundhog Day,"" now open at the August Wilson Theatre, is a textured, twisted and ticklish comic musical from composer Tim Minchin and director Matthew Warchus. The book is by Danny Rubin, who also co-wrote the screenplay to the 1993 film starring Bill Murray. With a cast led by Andy Karl, as the cynical TV weatherman stuck in a time warp, ""Groundhog Day"" shares with ""Matilda"" both an intriguing darkness and enough on-stage razzle-dazzle to seize your attention and hold it across two generally gut-busting acts.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,04/17/2017
Groundhog Day,9,Groundhog Day: EW stage review,"Coming off of a well-received run in London at the Old Vic, Groundhog Day - with a book by the original film's screenwriter Danny Rubin, music and lyrics by Tim Minchin (Matilda the Musical), and direction by Matthew Warchus (also Matilda as well as The Norman Conquests and God of Carnage) - doesn't mess too much with that set-up. Why would anyone bother? It's jeweler precise after all. Instead, it gooses up the familiar with dazzling energy, creativity, wit, and heart. Besides Karl, much of the credit goes to the playful stage design and illusions by Rob Howell with Paul Kieve, and the whirling-dervish choreography of Peter Darling with Ellen Kane. At times, Groundhog Day feels more like a plate-spinning magic trick than a Broadway musical.",Entertainment Weekly,Chris Nashawaty,04/17/2017

The fiendishly crafty creative team has devised a musical that cracks open the source material to amplify its themes, using the story's collision of misanthropy and sweetness to explore existential questions about lives stuck in neutral and the liberating power to unlock meaningful change by savoring every moment as a fresh experience.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/17/2017

This will come as a surprise, no doubt, to diehard fans of the film, which starred Murray as Phil Connors, a self-loving Pittsburgh weatherman assigned for the third year running to hit the road for Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual rite of P-Phil and his shadow.

Groundhog Day,8,‘Groundhog Day’ Fights to Wake From Its Broadway Nightmare,"This embracing of convention which Groundhog Day ultimately proposes is wrapped in a familiar redemption story. Yet the best things about Groundhog Day the musical are when the strangeness of the town, and Phil's extreme, snarled responses to it, are left on full, jangling boil. The musical is less convincing when it muffles itself to niceness; and it meanders far too lackadaisically to a conclusion. But at its center is Karl, a newly-minted Broadway hero, bravely performing through his pain. The question is, can he do this without hurting himself further, and should the producers let him: human costs versus performing costs.",Daily Beast,Tim Teeman,04/17/2017
Groundhog Day,7,'Groundhog Day' on Broadway: The show must (still) go on,"When it comes to credible depictions of small-town Pennsylvania, ""Groundhog Day the Musical"" is about as veracious as a woodchuck named Phil is a qualified rodent meteorologist. This British import to Broadway - staged by people for whom small-town America is a typology, rather than a collection of souls - is more Whoville than Punxsutawney. Director Matthew Warchus' overstuffed and near-chaotic production is similarly far from Woodstock, Ill., the doppelganger for exurban insularity used to film the 1993 movie - a film forged in the caustic and improvisational Second City style by the late, great Harold Ramis, with Bill Murray as his melancholic muse. Andy Karl, the handsome, courageous and hugely talented star of these musical proceedings, is closer to the open-face sandwich that is Jim Carrey than to the iconoclastic Cubs fan Murray, benign and dangerous, perplexing and perplexed and a guy who looked like he'd been knocked around by the storms of life.

He did so even while noting that this ""healing"" comedy, then opening Off Broadway, featured three major characters dying or disintegrating - and a bunch of others arguably worse off. I ask because the Roundabout Theater Company revival that opened on Thursday, giving the play its Broadway debut, barely seems to be any of the things Mr. Rich listed. Thoughtfully directed by Anne Kauffman; keenly performed by Lili Taylor, Janeane Garofalo and especially Celia Weston; a pleasure to watch throughout - it is all of these. But it is somehow, also, fatally mild.",New York Times,Jesse Green,06/29/2017
Marvin's Room,8,Marvin's Room,"Scott McPherson's Marvin's Room may sound, from that description, like a certain kind of TV movie of the week. But this pained yet comforting play cuts its sentiment with laughing-into-the-darkness comedy, just this side of absurdism, that reflects the influence of John Guare and Christopher Durang. And it also suggests a deep understanding of illness and sacrifice, drawn from McPherson's personal family history and the world he inhabited. ""I am 31, and my lover has AIDS,"" he wrote in a program note for the play's 1990 Hartford production. ""Our friends have AIDS. And we all take care of each other, the less sick caring for the more sick."" He died in 1992.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,06/29/2017
Marvin's Room,8,Broadway Review: ‘Marvin’s Room’ With Janeane Garofalo & Lili Taylor; ‘Measure For Measure’ With Jonathan Cake,"It's to the credit of everyone involved - these committed actors, the sensitive director and most of all McPherson - that the connections slow to take hold are soldered like emotional strands that throw off sparks as they finally fuse. Even the vaguely batty Ruth - touchingly played by Celia Weston without an ounce of condescension - addicted to soap operas as she is to the little box that gives her a charge of relief (while setting off the automatic garage door at the same time) plays a key role. McPherson's roar of valedictory comes in Bessie's quiet remonstrance to Lee near the end, that her greatest fortune in life is not to have been loved but to have loved, fully and completely.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,06/29/2017
Marvin's Room,8,‘Marvin’s Room’ review,"It might be surmised that some quarter century later McPherson's bleak comedy might have lost some of its sting, now that the central metaphor of illness - the ghostly presence of the AIDS crisis - has somewhat abated. But in fact ""Marvin's Room,"" seen today in the director Anne Kauffman's delicately hued but big-hearted production, seems as mordantly and ruefully truthful as ever. Maybe more so. As baby boomers struggle with issues of end-of-life care for their parents, and indeed themselves, and health care (mental and physical) has become a defining issue, if not the defining issue, in American political life, ""Marvin's Room"" feels even more acute and piercingly funny.",Broadway News,Charles Isherwood,06/29/2017

Celia Weston expertly underplays Ruth's ditzy innocence; Janeane Garofalo makes an impressive Broadway debut as the controlling Lee; Jack Difalco as the disturbed Hank is a major talent; and in a role that could so easily turn maudlin, Lili Taylor's naturalistic performance is downright life-affirming.",NY1,Roma Torre,06/29/2017
Marvin's Room,7,'Marvin's Room': Theater Review,"That's perhaps unfair to Scott McPherson's 1990 comedy-drama, which is well constructed, with a deft balance of dry comedy, wisdom and pathos, and a sincere appreciation of the challenging role of the caregiver. Its rich underlay of compassion speaks of the author's direct experiences - of living with elderly, ailing relatives, and of devastating suffering and fortifying love during the AIDS epidemic, when the play was written. (McPherson died of AIDS-related causes in 1992, aged 33, nine months after his partner.) But yesterday's clear-eyed reflection on life's blessings and blights can be today's saggy, sentimental Lifetime movie manqué in the wrong hands.

She segues briskly from shock to resilience, with the speed and force of a Gulf Coast storm, the way some people-lucky people-can do when faced with ill circumstances that are beyond their control. It's easy, as well, to empathize with Garofalo's chain-smoking Lee (the smoking, by the way, is the only indication ""Marvin's Room"" is set some years ago).

Staging the play is deceptively difficult, as its slow pace and confessional mini-monologues can easily become tedious, and that is often the case with this production (directed by Anne Kauffman, who has extensive Off-Broadway credits). Laura Jellinek's misconceived set design is overly expansive (with the actors frequently far away from each other) and elaborate (requiring the assistance of visible stagehands) and yet still incomplete (with a backyard scene performed around the kitchen).",Newsday,Matt Windman,06/29/2017
Marvin's Room,7,Marvin's Room is merely serious when you wish it would be moving,"With the whole of theater history on the shelf, what makes a producer reach for a particular show to re-stage? Beyond a don't-miss pairing of a classic role and a magnetic star (see: Hello, Dolly and Bette Midler), it helps for a revival to resonate - topically, emotionally - with present-day audiences. That's a harder task for a returning show in which the story is contemporaneous with its original premiere (Dolly, for instance, never ages because, even in 1964, it swept audiences to the turn of the century). Unfortunately, this first Broadway production of Marvin's Room never quite justifies its trip back to the early '90s.

While the acting is fine, the comedic elements of the story about the intertwining of life and death sometimes feel forced. That includes early scenes with a ridiculous doctor. Anne Kauffman's staging for the Roundabout, moreover, doesn't always maximize the material.

On Your Feet!,6,"Theater Review: At On Your Feet!, Is The Rhythm, In Fact, Gonna Get You?","I'm no fan of jukebox musicals. If they're the type that tell an invented tale, like Mamma Mia! or Rock of Ages, the book is generally rendered idiotic by the effort to accommodate the songs. If they're instead pop biographies, like Jersey Boys and Beautiful, the problem is even worse because the songs, too, are denatured, by the effort to accommodate a preexisting storyline. Furthermore, the structure of musicals in the second category can only lead to a bathetic climax: In the final scenes, the protagonists (Frankie Valli, Carole King) become exactly who we already knew them to be. That's more than ever the case with the new Gloria Estefan jukebox musical On Your Feet! because if you don't arrive at the Marquis Theatre knowing the billboard headlines of her story (Cuban immigrant becomes American pop star, gets hit by a truck, eventually returns in triumph) why are you there? The only real issues for me in approaching a show like this are the fun of the tunes and the ingenuity of the distraction. To say that On Your Feet! is better than most of its ilk is therefore faint praise; it means you might have almost as good a time as you would if it were merely a concert.",Vulture,Jesse Green,11/05/2015
On Your Feet!,6,‘On Your Feet!’ review: Gloria and Emilio Estefan Broadway musical has a catchy beat and a corny story,"A paint-by-numbers portrait can still be colorful - and a kick. Case in point: ""On Your Feet!,"" a predictable but entertaining show about Gloria Estefan and her music-producer husband Emilio. The jukebox musical checks off all the usual-suspect plot points: humble roots, showbiz hurdles, tragedy, triumph, plus a gratuitous dance concert as a chaser.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,11/05/2015
On Your Feet!,6,Broadway's 'On Your Feet' celebrates Estefans,"Sadly, the broad, obvious strokes used by librettist Alexander Dinelaris, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of Birdman, prove not so appealing. In crafting a book that tells the Estefans' back story, weaving in their songs, Dinelaris follows a template used before in jukebox musicals, perhaps most successfully in Jersey Boys. That enduring hit (also choreographed by Trujillo) follows the ups and downs of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons with a mostly light, deft touch, ensuring that the focus is on the songs as vehicles for the performers.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,11/05/2015
On Your Feet!,5,'On Your Feet!' review: This rhythm will barely get you,"""On Your Feet!"" has a whitewashed, corporate-approved texture, which makes Gloria and Emilio come off as utterly devoid of personality despite their accomplishments and personal drama. It's so self-congratulatory that one gets the impression that they personally vetted every line. The production (directed by Jerry Mitchell and choreographed by Sergio Trujillo) comes to life during upbeat production numbers, which have lively, salsa-flavored movement and a hot sound. But more often than not, it gets mired in flashbacks and other downbeat sequences in which the songs lack impact. It feels rather like a pop concert that is too often paused...Ana Villafañe...is a beauty with a bright presence. She receives solid support from Josh Segarra as the gentle Emilio and Andréa Burns as Gloria's stern mother.",amNY,Matt Windman,11/05/2015

The same is true of the music that flows through the show...Rich in sympathy and humor, Indecent is as captivating the second time as the first...An elegant tribute to things that vanish in the blink of a historical eye, Indecent is a memorial that feels like a blessing.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,04/18/2017

It is a thrill to report that this 105-minute, multilingual...adventure is a natural fit. It's a gripping and entertaining show with laughter and tears and a real rainstorm in which two women from the marvelous 10-member cast re-enact what, in 1921, had been the first lesbian kiss on an American stage...In her program note, Vogel writes, ""I believe the purpose of theater is to wound our memory so we can remember.""

But I'll give it my best and hope that you'll set aside any argument touting its importance - because Indecent ain't just spinach - and instead make haste for the Cort Theatre simply to share the astonishing power of this new play with music about a delicious ancient Broadway scandal that pulses through the decades to our own time.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,04/18/2017

Director Rebecca Taichman...has many more gems like that throughout her beautiful and arresting staging...It would be hard to find a weak link among the cast...Playing a handful of roles each, you'll marvel as they lose and gain costume pieces, accents and mannerisms to bring the many voices involved in this play's past to life.

Indecent,8,Broadway Review: ‘Indecent’ by Paula Vogel,"Thanks to Taichman's impressionistic direction and David Dorfman's stylized choreography, a troupe of long-slumbering Yiddish actors rise from the ashes and stiffly come to life to play their parts in this drama...This is not a linear production, so scenes in real time bleed into times past and future, and backstage scenes echo scenes within the play...We already know the outcome of their professional arguments.

Yes, that happened. ""Indecent,"" the heart-stirring and haunting play created in tandem by author Paula Vogel and director Rebecca Taichman offers a dramatic reminder of that - and of the power of art...Vogel...and Taichman - each in an impressive Broadway debut - tell the story in vibrantly theatrical fashion.

Vogel tells her complicated, sprawling story with urgent economy. She uses the rain scene, enacted by Katrina Lenk and Adina Verson, as a leitmotiv.

The creators use a full array of theatrical tools...to lend a sense of poetry, spectacle and scale to what might otherwise have been a too-modest tale.",NJ.com,Christopher Kelly,04/18/2017
Indecent,8,'Indecent' on Broadway: Lessons of an obscenity trial,"Nonetheless, there is no questioning the force and sincerity of Vogel's determination to elevate the biography and artistic contribution of a little-known playwright whose early 20th-century work suffered the discrimination widely faced by the Yiddish theater, and by the immigrant artists whose stories it represented. As Vogel tells it in a highly skilled, clearly personal and deftly structured piece - co-conceived and directed by Rebecca Taichman - Asch was the near equal of such famed masters of the nascent American theater as Eugene O'Neill, and certainly a writer with even more courage.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/18/2017
Indecent,8,“Indecent” review,"A new play based on real events, ""Indecent""...finds the writer in both familiar and exemplary form...Telling a tale that spans many decades against the backdrop of history on two continents is an ambitious assignment. Taichman uses almost every Brechtian device at her disposal (supertitles, direct address narration, musical scoring and cabaret interludes among them,) creating some beautiful stage pictures along the way...Cumulatively, the many elements of the staging affords us the scope to think as well as feel. Vogel and Taichman provide the audience with many signposts to navigate and much to ponder, so much so that we can become preoccupied with tracking the morphing of the characters, as opposed to investing emotionally in their singular inner lives.",Broadway News,Elizabeth Bradley,04/18/2017
Indecent,8,The Lesbian Love That Survived the Nazis: Review of ‘Indecent’ on Broadway,"The play, for Vogel and Taichman who created it together, is an interrogation of the many definitions and interpretations of ""indecency""...Indecent can feel a little cluttered in its staging. Actors scurry this way and that. It is not always clear who is who, and who is speaking. Yiddish when spoken and sung has a translation projected on to the back wall. This uneven structure and pace can feel a little like casting an eye over a dense thesis with too many footnotes. But Indecent's roving eye, its busy-ness, its insistence to be about everything-homophobia, censorship, freedom of expression, tyranny-is as fascinating and genuine as it can be frustrating to watch.",Daily Beast,Tim Teeman,04/18/2017

Oslo,9,Review: ‘Oslo’ Fills a Large Canvas in a Thrilling Production,"Some works of art cry out for large canvases. Though it is sparing in its use of scenery or anything approaching spectacle, J. T. Rogers's ""Oslo,"" an against-the-odds story of international peacemaking, is undeniably a big play, as expansive and ambitious as any in recent Broadway history. So it is particularly gratifying to announce that it has been allowed to stretch to its full height in the thrilling production that opened on Thursday night, directed with a master's hand by Bartlett Sher.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,04/13/2017
Oslo,9,Review – ‘Oslo’ Moves Upstairs To Broadway; Bobby Cannavale’s Cage (And Soul) Rattling ‘Hairy Ape’,"Now comes the extraordinary Oslo, Rogers' riveting dramatization of another complex political tarantella that unfolded in secret before, in September 1993, stunning the world. That was when Bill Clinton presided at a Rose Garden ceremony in which Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the Palestine Liberation Organization's chairman Yasser Arafat shook hands after signing a historic peace accord. Oslo opened last summer in Lincoln Center Theater's Mitzi E. Newhouse; it's moved upstairs to the Tony-eligible Vivian Beaumont, where it opened tonight. It's even better the second time around.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,04/13/2017
Oslo,9,Oslo: EW stage review,"As we now know, that period was just a warm-up for the noise and chaos that followed, and Oslo has arrived at LCT's Broadway venue with its sense of urgency intact, if not heightened. Director Bartlett Sher, whose rigorous insights into history and human relationships have buoyed new works and revivals, has actors rearrange the pieces of Michael Yeargan's spare set as one scene flows into another, so that the production seems in constant, almost frantic, motion. Their characters pace and circle each other and raise their voices suddenly, lashing out or buckling under the strain of having to maintain their composure. Bits of dialogue teeter into speechifying here and there, but you'll barely notice; the balance of passion, discipline, and suspense is organically, thrillingly theatrical.",Entertainment Weekly,Elysa Gardner,04/13/2017

""Oslo"" reminds theatergoers of that as it imagines the secret and highly charged talks that led to a break in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict nearly 25 years ago. Smart, touching and spiked with spy-novel tension and wry humor, the drama at Lincoln Center is the latest work by J.T. Rogers. Two of his earlier plays dramatized struggles in Rwanda and Afghanistan.

""Oslo,"" in its account of intractable foes finding common ground, is irresistible and, ultimately, deeply moving. Jokes are related at the negotiating table, at the expense of the string-pulling leaders behind the scenes, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin; memories are shared about the suffering of warring peoples, the devotion to loved ones at home. The small acts of soul-bearing indeed bind the characters to one another - and an audience to them.

Rogers' three-hour ensemble drama depicting the back-and-forth backroom negotiations leading up to the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The play is long and talky and jam-packed with names, dates and historical exposition, but also well-crafted and nuanced, with interesting characters and even humor every now and then. The subject matter is also increasingly vital at this time of heightened instability throughout the Middle East. Under the direction of Bartlett Sher, it is presented with as much clarity and personality as possible.",amNY,Matt Windman,04/13/2017
Oslo,8,Oslo,"The approach to politics practiced in (and preached by) Oslo is so different from our current discourse that it might seems (sic) quaint if it weren't so persuasive. J.T. Rogers's account of 1993 meetings between Israelis and Palestinians, which led to the breakthrough Oslo Accords, is a testament to the potential value of diplomacy, cooperation, mutual recognition of opponents' humanity and-contra the now-trending WikiLeaks ethos-backroom secrecy. Arriving at those things was not easy even then: As Rogers lays out, in a narrative flush with historical detail, it took the ingenious private openness and public duplicity of a well-connected Norwegian couple, Terje Rød-Larsen (Jefferson Mays) and Mona Juul (Jennifer Ehle), to get the warring parties to the negotiating table-and, no less crucially, the dining table.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,04/13/2017

Yeah, sure. If that seems unlikely, so does the idea that diplomacy could be the subject of a madly engrossing play, and for a similar reason: How do you make tact and accommodation rewarding? More specifically, how do you theatricalize draft treaties and position papers? Yet J. T. Rogers's Oslo, which opened on Broadway tonight in a Lincoln Center Theater production directed by Bartlett Sher, turns the negotiations that led to the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord of 1993 into gripping human drama.

The absurdity of levity in the situation is as present as high-stakes political brinkmanship: Ehle is such a calm operator that the moment she freaks out at some randomly-appeared tourists is a moment of dramatic wonder. Within the conversations there are wry surprises too: In the middle of the backwards and forwards over giving up territory, and ownership of cities, one character asks another who-the Israelis and the Palestinians-will be responsible for tax and garbage collection. That's what the government really needs to get right.",Daily Beast,Tim Teeman,04/13/2017

My reaction, I should hasten to make clear, is not one that will likely be shared by many who go to see Bartlett Sher's crystalline production of a fine new American play by J.T. Rogers - though I expect other minds will be similarly concentrated by the issues the play raises. Is the fault in myself, I mused, or in the stars?

It also loses its grip due to predictability and a miscalibrated staging...It is not a pretty picture. But it is as straight-up and real as it gets. Too bad performances frequently don't ring true in director Kate Whoriskey's staging. Too often actors don't look and sound like people talking, but performers emoting.

Sweat,7,Theater Review: Lynn Nottage’s Sweat Tells But Doesn’t Show,"What I realized seeing the play again is that its central conflict - between Tracey, who is white, and Cynthia, who is black - is trumped-up. This is not to say that longtime friendships have not been shattered over work disputes, or that work disputes have not surfaced the subcutaneous racism of white people hanging on to their last scrap of privilege. But nothing in Sweat convinces us that these particular women, as established, could develop in the way the play forces them to.

If there have been script changes, they don't appear to have been major. Jones is the only new addition to the cast, but perhaps what's happening is a strengthened connection between Mendez's Laura and Glick's Jordan as their relationship moves far beyond the straight woman/gay man dynamic typically found in popular culture. A second act confrontation that has Laura in tears because Jordan feel she's abandoning him by getting married is brutal to watch and you can legitimately ache for both characters.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,03/02/2017

Significant Other,8,'Significant Other': Theater Review,"Under playwright Joshua Harmon's compassionate gaze, that potentially mopey, extended sitcom scenario becomes by turns hilarious and poignant, delivering a relatable contemporary take on the old-fashioned theme of waiting with increasing impatience for Mr. Right. In addition to the sharp, insightful writing, a big part of what prevents this delightful play from turning either trite or maudlin is the wonderful performance of Gideon Glick as Jordan, who is late-twenties, geeky-cute, comfortable in his sexuality, gainfully employed in advertising and desirably located in an Upper West Side Manhattan apartment. But somehow, despite his gnawing hunger for a fulfilling relationship, he remains hopelessly single. He and his similarly solo closest friend Laura (Lindsay Mendez) make a pact to be each other's fallback option should the romantic horizon remain empty.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,03/02/2017
Significant Other,8,Broadway review: Significant Other is a bittersweet comic delight,"Gay characters in mass culture often serve as supportive accessories in the marriage plots of others, but Harmon keeps Jordan in sharp, brutally revealing focus. Anyone whose heart has ever been broken can relate to his plight. Pushing 30, he has never been in a serious relationship, and his desperation to change that-sabotaged by his obsessiveness and awkwardness-only makes things worse.

There's self-adoring, pleasantly vulgar Kiki (Sas Goldberg); cool, self-confident Vanessa (Rebecca Naomi Jones) and, first among these equals, Laura (the superb Lindsay Mendez), whose ironic attitude and self-doubt make her Jordan's soul mate.

If Harmon doesn't eschew cliches - the playwright wields them with surprising wit, in fact - he has crafted, in Jordan, a central character who defies them.

Significant Other,7,"Review: In ‘Significant Other,’ the Gay Best Friend Is the Odd Man Out","The four central performers chart their characters' fraying ties with a graceful, instinctive grasp of the hierarchies and role playing that occur within such relationships. They're at their most poignantly expressive when they're dancing together (in dwindling numbers) at one another's weddings. (Sam Pinkleton deserves credit as the choreographer.) Mark Wendland's multilevel set nicely evokes the sense of a city of myriad dwelling places, to which people retreat in insulated isolation, whether as pairs or singletons. And John Behlmann and Luke Smith drolly fulfill their purposes as the various men in the central characters' lives. But the play's structure, built around an and-then-there-was-one countdown of weddings, can start to feel like a sustained musical vamp with only slight variations.

The play's peppy (occasionally extremely funny) comedy ill-balances its very dark heart, which-as the final curtain reveals-is really about one man's terrible isolation.

After all, what you're listening to often gleams with the blended polyphony of a good-size band. Yet not an instrument has been used in the performance of this a cappella musical, staged by the Tony-winning director and choreographer Kathleen Marshall. Everything we hear, as we are told in a (sung) preshow announcement, is created by human voices. Acknowledging this is rather like admiring the ingenuity that must have gone into a sentimental picture of a rainbow, perhaps with the Care Bears in the foreground, rendered entirely in bottle caps.

If all of Marshall's cleverness as a director and choreographer goes toward smoothing and polishing the surfaces, perhaps that's because in a cotton-candy musical like this one there's nothing underneath. The cast, for instance, is admirably diverse, yet from the show's portrait you would think that the New York subway in 2016 represented a utopian post-racial environment.

Rarely, though, do you get a chance to see his forgotten first play, Platonov. There are a couple of reasons for that: The first and most obvious is that, as written, the four-act drama is five hours long – an endurance test for even the heartiest and most devoted Chekhovian. Second, and more mysteriously, it’s just one of those plays that tends to get overlooked. It’s a second-tier work that seems to shrink when put under the same spotlight as Chekhov’s first-tier ones.

It's one of the most memorable party sequences I've ever seen, a volcanic channeling of a displaced class's fear, anger and disgust.

The Present,5,Theater Review: Cate Blanchett Boosts Up The Present (And So Does Her Underwear),"... if the politics of this Platonov revamp are apt enough, the drama still founders on the play's inability to link them convincingly to the nearly farcical social comedy of individuals at loose ends. Partly this is because the production, directed somewhat bumpily by John Crowley, keeps the politics at bay for too long while it focuses on the radiating damage an empty man can cause at great removes, like a storm surge. We do not really understand the stakes until it's too late, which may be accurate for the characters but undermines the audience. Chekhov's famous dramaturgical dictum - ""one must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off"" - is meticulously observed here; the General's old pistol is all but spotlit throughout. But however much damage it finally causes, it isn't enough to turn The Present, which operates best as a comedy, into the tragedy it seems to wish it were. It would take Chekhov another 20 years to figure out how to make the two things into one.",Vulture,Jesse Green,01/08/2017
The Present,4,"Broadway review: In The Present, Cate Blanchett does Chekhov, Australian style","Chekhov never wrote a play called The Present; that's what Australian adapter Andrew Upton calls his remodeled Platonov. Then again, Chekhov never wrote a play called Platonov; that's one of the titles historians have applied to the Russian dramatist's untitled, unwieldy, unfinished work, found in a safe-deposit box 16 years after his death. I've never read or seen the piece: An uncut staging would run about five hours. Young Chekhov wrote it while in medical school, and by all accounts, it's a dramaturgical train wreck (ending with suicide on actual train tracks-eat your heart out, Martin McDonagh!).",TimeOut NY,David Cote,01/08/2017

We are in the '70s but Wilson never burdened his decades with easy pop-sociological markers. Vietnam is closer but no less life-altering than black experiences in Korea. Many of the actors are veterans of Wilson's storytelling style, experts in the unspooling ways he defines character and plot through grand handfuls of luscious and gritty street poetry.

We certainly get the great Wilsonian flow of men's voices as they spool out their rough poetry of survival, and the delight of characters who are real characters. Some are familiar types from the rest of the cycle: There's dignified Becker, who runs the off-the-books jitney service; troublemaking Turnbo, the yakker with his nose in everyone's business; Youngblood, the struggling 20-something trying to do right by his girlfriend and their child; and Fielding, the dipso-sage with unexpected seams of experience and expertise. (He was once a tailor for Billy Eckstine.) Wilson orchestrates their voices with jazzlike felicity, abetted perhaps a bit too glibly by the setting; every time the phone rings with a customer needing a ride home from the grocery store, the kaleidoscope of characters reconfigures.

I needn't have worried.

(There's also lots of less helpful material about being and time.) McBurney intercuts the narrative with recordings of his sleepless daughter's desire to be told just one more story.

Heisenberg,8,Theater Review: Heisenberg Finds Location and Momentum on Broadway,"That changed dynamic is the other factor in the play's new spin. When I first saw it, the relative hush of the house seemed to favor Alex's arc, which was, at least superficially, more serious and perhaps more relatable: After resisting Georgie as a flake, and even after understanding that her motives in romancing him might be impure, he takes a flier with her in the hope that, sane or not, she can distract him from his profound loneliness. (His only confidant is a long-dead sister, who visits him in dreams.) But in that reading, Alex's influence on Georgie is imperceptible if not beside the point. Near the end, when she describes him as looking ""full of wonder,"" you understand that his insistence on the primacy of observable fact over imputed concepts like mood or even personality have barely rubbed off on her. ""It's probably just my retinas,"" he says. There is no such thing as ""wonder,"" only dead cells floating in vitreous humor.",Vulture,Jesse Green,10/13/2016

Heisenberg,8,Broadway review: Mary-Louise Parker and Denis Arndt strike unusual sparks in Heisenberg,"If I understand the oblique title correctly, Heisenberg is about how being with another person-being observed, at close range -can affect your direction. Georgie and Alex are set in their different ways, defining who they are by who they've been; their unlikely romance opens them to things they would not have imagined for themselves. Mark Brokaw's spare production, which played at Manhattan Theatre Club's small City Center space last year, seem even less imposing in the company's Broadway house, but that works to its advantage.

Fun Home,9,Theater Review: Fun Home in Its New Round House,"I already thought that Fun Home was the best new musical of the year in 2013, when it opened at the Public Theater. It's hard to imagine that its Broadway transfer, and transformation, will not make it the best of this season as well. I say ""transformation"" even though in most ways it's nearly a replica: The librettist Lisa Kron has perhaps cut or tightened a few lines of dialogue, and the composer Jeanine Tesori, apart from excising one charming but redundant little song (""Al for Short""), has made only the kind of changes a fanatic would notice. Fun Home is still basically what it was when I reviewed it in 2013: the story, based on Alison Bechdel's autobiographical graphic memoir, of a lesbian cartoonist trying in middle age to understand her father, who killed himself shortly after revealing to her that he, too, was gay. Back then I called it ""hilarious and crushing,"" and it remains so now. Maybe less hilarious and more crushing.",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/19/2015

What's most striking is how a show about the power of whimsy and imagination is so lacking in both. Paulus and Company don't trust intimacy and charm, so everything is overplayed -- despite the advice to an actor rehearsing Barrie's ""Peter Pan"" to go ""smaller.""

The Llewelyn Davies boys...have charm to spare...To gussy up the proceedings, Graham, Barlow, Kennedy and director Diane Paulus, relying on her Pippin-like circus instincts, turn to all sorts of diversions. One of the fussiest is Frohman's acting troupe. They behave like something from Charles Dickens but diluted and cheapened in the transition...Since this is a musical, the score is the biggest disappointment...Off-rhymes have become increasingly acceptable in Top 40 realms, but only come across as lazy in a period piece such as Finding Neverland...They can organize '90s power ballads but not imbue them with anything that clings to the memory once the last full notes fade.",Huffington Post,David Finkle,04/15/2015

Instead, it heightens the screenplay's sentimentality, tidy psychologizing and life-affirming messages by thickening their syrup and corn quotients in ways presumably deemed palatable to theatergoing children and their parents...Every song...vaguely reminds you of some recording you have heard in the background of your life...I'm assuming the theory is that high volume will obliterate our awareness that this music is fatally ersatz.

Finding Neverland,5,Theater Review: A Rough Takeoff for Finding Neverland,"Finding Neverland purports to be historical: the true tale of how Barrie, inspired by his dealings with the family of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, created the boy who wouldn't grow up. It also purports to be a singing-dancing family entertainment. It winds up being neither...What's accurate -- perhaps the only thing -- is that Barrie acknowledged the Davies brood as his muses for Peter Pan...On this slender foundation Finding Neverland...builds an enormous superstructure of trite psychology...Finding Neverland demonstrates about as much insight into creativity borne of loss as a Facebook memorial candle. Even if everything in it were profound and true, it would still be a mess, suffering as it does from confusion (or willfulness) about what makes a musical a musical. In good ones, songs are not decorations applied interchangeably to the exterior of a story, like gift-wrap. They are the gift. Here, they seem to be recycled from a different package entirely...More attention has been lavished on the show's tricks than its logic.",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/15/2015

But the two hours-plus leading up to that moment, more often than not, are a chore...On the plus side, the expected patchwork signs of a Frankenstein's monster are not apparent. The show is fairly much of a piece, even if there's scant cohesion to the new score by Take That frontman Gary Barlow and Brit songwriter Eliot Kennedy, which weaves cloying platitudes into numbers that run from generic pop to bad theatrical pastiche...At the core of the show are sensitive, naturalistic performances from Morrison and Kelly, two accomplished musical-theater actors who sketch their characters' mutual yearnings and sorrows in delicate strokes, at times finding sincerity even in the most hackneyed lyrics...there's nonetheless no convincing argument here that a Finding Neverland musical was ever an artistically valid idea.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/15/2015

Some of the cartoonish overacting and second-act plucking of heartstrings might be forgiven if the score were enchanting, but Gary Barlow and Eliot Kennedy's tunes (a mix of Britpop and pseudo-music-hall) are generic and burdened by cheap, trite lyrics.

The 90-minute show...is a triumph of voices and athleticism from Ferguson...The amount of concentration required by Ferguson is impressive and director Jason Moore runs a tight ship.

Initially he's just Sam Callahan, a struggling actor sullenly working a pre-Christmas shift taking reservations at a superhot Manhattan restaurant. But as the outside lines, the in-house intercoms, and his own cellphone start ringing, Ferguson takes on the vocal and gestural lives of all the callers: would-be guests, terrified assistants; his agent, friends, frenemies, and family; the arrogant chef, the tantrum-y maître d', and various others, all exploding with ASAP demands. Needless to say, this being a restaurant, none of the demands is a true emergency, no matter how much the callers bully and scream - unless accommodating Gwyneth Paltrow with an all-vegan tasting menu for 15, with flattering light bulbs and no women servers, counts as an emergency.",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/25/2016

Under the direction of Jason Moore (""Avenue Q""), Ferguson throws himself into it head first. And if it was being staged at a smaller space, it may very well have been captivating.

Motown The Musical,3,Theater Review: Motown: The Musical,"To a roomful of people who have rarely if ever been part of the creation of a major musical, perhaps it seemed sufficient to tie a few dozen presold numbers together with just enough thread to tell a story. (Mamma Mia! has so far grossed more than $534 million on Broadway doing just that.) But the problem with jukeboxes has never been the songs. The problem is that when songs are forced to tell a tale they weren't designed for, they lose their deeper effectiveness, and usually end up like leeches, no longer supporting but sucking. In that respect, Motown is the worst jukebox (with the best tunes) I've ever encountered.",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/14/2013
Bright Star,8,Review: ‘Bright Star’ Beams Nostalgia Underscored by Fiddles and Banjos,"The musical is gentle-spirited, not gaudy, and moves with an easygoing grace where others prance and strut. And it tells a sentiment-spritzed story...that you might be more likely to encounter in black and white, flickering from your flat-screen on Turner Classic Movies. The protagonist, Alice Murphy, portrayed by Carmen Cusack -- making a simply gorgeous Broadway debut -- is a spunky girl in her late teens in the scenes set in the 1920s. A dreamer with a rebellious streak and a hunger for literature, she's causing a fine ruckus in the sleepy town of Zebulon...While the story certainly skirts (if not embraces) sentimentality and the overripeness of melodrama, the production's soft-hued style -- and the sometimes wry tone of Mr. Martin's book -- keeps it from curdling into treacle. The songs boast simple but seductive melodies, and lyrics that have a sweet, homespun quality.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,03/24/2016

That's a tall order in 2016, with irony and its bratty child, snark, having emerged as prevalent comic tools. But Martin, a master ironist, captures some of that old-school spirit with a book that's as forthright as it is smart, funny and charming...Director Walter Bobbie culls spirited, endearing performances from the actors cast in these roles. Carmen Cusack's Alice evolves convincingly from a mischievous girl to an accomplished but lonely and disappointed woman, while A.J.

Bright Star,8,‘Bright Star’ review: Steve Martin’s musical enchants,"It doesn't shy away from the cornball or the unapologetically sentimental. And, yes, the plot is implausibly romantic and hinged on coincidence. Along with all that, however, ""Bright Star"" is also downright wonderful -- a multichambered sweetheart of an original that Steve Martin and Edie Brickell created for Broadway from little more than a 1902 news item about a lost baby and an unbridled love of American roots music...At first, all the ""sun's gonna shine"" and ""a man's gotta do"" songs seem awfully simple and self-explanatory...But as the relationships deepen and darken, the show -- directed with a lack of cynicism and lots of rolling wood furniture by Walter Bobbie (""Chicago"") -- grows with the complexity of a juicy short story. The large cast is uniformly appealing, with choreography that brings a haunting moodiness to the square dances and jitterbugs. Then there's the score, which builds with rhythmic surprises, melodic complexity and the deep satisfaction of humming and plucking strings.",Newsday,Linda Winer,03/24/2016
Bright Star,8,Steve Martin’s ‘Bright Star’ a heartwarming crowd-pleaser,"Compared to other new Broadway musicals, ""Bright Star"" is a total anomaly. It's wholly original and unashamedly sentimental and romantic, with a country-folk score and no well-known actors in the cast...The storytelling can be jumbled, improbable and sappy, and the characters are undeveloped. Nevertheless, it is a heartwarming and crowd-pleasing musical, sporting many pleasant country songs (backed by piano, guitar and banjo), a sunny disposition and a Southern Gothic flavor...Walter Bobbie's attractive production is marked by vibrant performances, brisk movement...and a backwoods visual design.",amNY,Matt Windman,03/24/2016

In collaboration with the folk-rock musician Edie Brickell, Martin forged score, book and story for this wholly original musical -- a piece that, despite its tonal unevenness and frequent, needless diversions from truth, still feels like a significant, distinctive and artful entry into the Broadway repertory. And it comes replete with a beautiful leading performance from Carmen Cusack, an actress who has worked often in musicals in Chicago but here makes a gorgeously authentic Broadway debut that looks likely to change her life.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,03/24/2016

Bright Star,7,'Bright Star': Theater Review,"A key inspiration for Bright Star was a real-life story from 1902, but the plot contrivances woven around that incident -- a lost infant, an encounter many years later between strangers unaware of their deep connection, a conveniently timed discovery and a rapturous happy ending, complete with matching betrothals -- are so fanciful that only Shakespeare could have gotten away with them. Still, there's a disarming sweetness and sincerity to this folksy Americana bluegrass musical, created by Steve Martin and Edie Brickell, which makes the tuneful melodrama a pleasurable experience.

Paul Alexander Nolan...has an easygoing confidence as another character we get to know at different stages of life...Martin and Brickell's music is rootsy and most often joyful...Of Martin's book, I felt that too often I was being told what to feel, without being given opportunity to feel it. Connective tissue between the storylines, probably intended to sneak up on us at the end, seemed obvious halfway through the first act...It's not a perfect musical; this ""Star"" doesn't always guide the way, but at times it beams brightly enough.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,03/24/2016

(It's also tauter - about 10 minutes shorter than it was in Washington.) Evoking a bucolic North Carolina of the 1920s and '40s, set designer Eugene Lee deploys a skeletal cabin on wheels as the visual centerpiece, in which the band, expertly conducted by Rob Berman, sits and strums Martin and Brickell's amiable tunes, albeit with some oddly-set lyrics.

""If you knew my story, you'd have a good story to tell,"" the leading lady sings. But after 2½ hours of this down-home hokum, the answer is clear: No, we don't. Comedian and banjo enthusiast Steve Martin has teamed up with singer-songwriter Edie Brickell to write a cliche-ridden, foot-pounding, over-eager Southern Gothic romance that ill serves a wonderful Broadway debut in Carmen Cusack. The show that opened Thursday at the Cort Theatre never hits an honest note and seems to have been written by two people who adore classic Broadway musicals but who have intentionally decided to make a third-rate version.

But after a bunch of choruses, they also sound repetitive...American roots music is grounded in the English narrative ballad, so it makes sense that Brickell's literate but plot-driven lyrics are intended to advance the story...The big drawback to the chatty lyrics is that they re-hash the plot's melodramatic content, but neglect to deepen or explore the characters.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,03/24/2016

With banal, self-cancelling, upbeat lyrics...it mostly shows us that we are going to have, in Bright Star, a banal, self-cancelling, upbeat musical, the kind that wants to demonstrate a lot of heart without actually having one. Which is not to say it has no smarts and no value. There's a lot to like in Bright Star and a lot to admire in the way it was made...How the stories intersect with the songs is the larger problem here.

In ""Bright Star,"" directed by Walter Bobbie, Mr. Martin and Edie Brickell, a singer-songwriter with whom he has made two albums, tell the story of a painfully earnest young writer from the hills of North Carolina (A.J. Shively) who comes home from World War II and sells a painfully earnest short story to a prestigious Asheville quarterly edited by an unhappy woman (Carmen Cusack) with a terrible secret -- or, rather, a Terrible Secret, this being the kind of show that is constructed exclusively out of uppercase clichés. The best thing about ""Bright Star"" is the music, which is bland and undramatic but competently wrought. The plot is trite, the dialogue humorless and stiff, the lyrics stupefyingly banal...The cast and onstage band work hard and Mr. Bobbie does his best to breathe life into ""Bright Star,"" but if Mr. Martin's name weren't on the marquee, it wouldn't have gotten anywhere near Broadway.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,03/24/2016

Their work is suffused with an irresistible chemistry of longing and optimism and even a kind of countrified mysticism that divines hope in sorrowful corners of the soul. So my advice is to spend an evening with Love Has Come For You and the new album, So Familiar, and skip Bright Star, the unfortunate musical they have brought to the Cort Theatre...If you can recall the take-no-prisoners lunacy of Martin's play Picasso at the Lapin Agile, you may be doubly disappointed by this earnest but soggy mess.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,03/24/2016

Shively): ""a sweeping tale of pain and redemption."" But it cries out for an editor's sharp blue pen. Sweeping? In lieu of the color that the story seems to call for, Walter Bobbie's production is often actively plain, as though trying to hide its central bathos in beige. Painful? For the audience, perhaps, thanks to shoddy craftsmanship that saddles likable, plucky bluegrass music with lyrics that run from workmanlike to egregious. It does, however, have a genuine redeeming feature in Cusack...Cusack is distinctive and immediately interesting, convincing at playing Alice at both ages, with a voice that is full of beautiful surprises.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,03/24/2016

If the first half can sometimes feel too baggy and broadly-played, and the second almost seems to rush through its most affecting moments, the overall impact is still startling. Gurira, whose parents emigrated from Zimbabwe, and the Kenyan-raised Nyong'o obviously shouldn't have to carry the weight of representing their entire continent for a Western audience on Golden's stage.

With only 177 seats in the house, audience and performers seemed to be breathing the same air. One wondered whether that connection would be broken when the show moved to a much larger Broadway theater. Not to worry. The 900-seat Golden Theater was originally designed to be an intimate house, a good fit for small-scaled, serious plays, of which ""Eclipsed"" is decidedly one. And while the $95 top-priced ticket was a draw for downtown theatergoers, at a new top of $145, the show hits the sweet spot for the serious New York theater crowd - the ideal audience for this intense drama - that often feels overlooked and underserved on Broadway.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,03/06/2016

No doubt the back cover subsidized the front, because the chances of a play like Eclipsed getting to Broadway without a star of Nyongo's current cachet are nil. Eclipsed is about Liberian women forced into sex slavery during that country's mad civil war. And while it has moments of light-heartedness, and a wind-up that could conceivably be called hopeful (the war, after all, does end), most of the play, by Danai Gurira, is crushingly sad; what else could it be?

Revisiting the play with the same director on Broadway opposite a sensational Michelle Williams, the actor now brings a noticeably deepened middle-aged gravitas that adds fascinating layers to his character -- of bitter defensiveness, corrosive dishonesty, subjugated desire, and ultimately, ice-cold fear. Unyielding in its needling focus, this riveting drama is a stark examination of love, pain and loss that's both compassionate and unforgiving, all of which helps it navigate the move to a bigger stage with a corresponding amplification of its emotional power.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,03/10/2016

As it is, your first impressions of Ray and Una -- so intensely embodied by Jeff Daniels and Michelle Williams in the Broadway production of David Harrower's ""Blackbird"" -- would seem to guarantee a satisfyingly fraught night at the theater.

She speaks in a halting, affected manner, as if Una has been rehearsing these speeches in her head for years, a girl trying to sound like an adult...As when he played Ray nine years ago, Daniels brilliantly rages, bargains, stonewalls and implodes...Time has been shattered for these walking ghosts, and we are transfixed watching them cut their hands, sifting through the shards.",TimeOut NY,David Cote,03/10/2016

Daniels' portrayal seems more urgently embodied than before...the most dangerous aspect of the work...is the playwright's refusal to moralize...Daniels makes every moment of this faceoff vibratingly real.

Director Nicholaw...keeps things moving at a sprightly pace, although he overdoes the carnival-style dance sequences that are clearly intended to provide visual distraction...The performers put the fanciful material over with admirable energy and emotional conviction...But the real find is Lewis, who amazingly is 11 years old in real life and whose precocious talent suggests that she may secretly be immortal herself.",Hollywood Reporter,Frank Scheck,04/26/2016

So perhaps we should be grateful that Winnie, the heroine of the 1975 ""young adult"" fantasy novel Tuck Everlasting, has been bumped up from 10 to 11 for the musical adaptation that just opened on Broadway: She is that much more bearable. But whether the work of so many talented people in effecting the adaptation has added anything of value beyond that one year is another matter; this is, almost until the end, a ruthlessly by-the-book treatment of a high-concept, low-wattage fairy tale.

That ""Misery"" succeeds is a testament to the ingenuity of King's original material, the deftness of director Will Frears' staging, and especially the roller-coaster force of Willis' co-star Laurie Metcalf (from TV's ""Roseanne""), who (almost) makes you forget the iconic stamp Kathy Bates put on the same part in the film version. Despite Willis' flat performance, ""Misery"" turns out to be something Broadway hasn't seen in years: an old-fashioned chiller from the Ira Levin/""Deathtrap"" school, where the gasps and the giggles are deliciously jumbled together.",NJ.com,Christopher Kelly,11/15/2015

But Misery isn't really Paul's play, any more than the 1990 screen version -- penned by William Goldman, who also wrote this play -- was his movie. You may remember that James Caan played Paul in that film, but he was vastly overshadowed by Kathy Bates as Annie Wilkes, the obsessive fan who retrieves the injured writer from the site of the crash. Annie brings Paul to her farmhouse -- conveniently close to the hotel in Silver Creek, Colorado where he has just finished his latest work -- and holds him captive, through a combination of psychological torture and physical violence.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,11/15/2015

Misery,7,"Laurie Metcalf, stuck in 'Misery' with Bruce Willis","The fundamental problem, alas, with the performance of Willis, the star of some of the highest-grossing action movies in Hollywood history, is that his reaction to all of those realizations, upon which the forward trajectory of this theoretically scary play depends, are wholly homogenous - to the extent, that is, that one can detect any reaction from him at all. Metcalf is, of course, an inveterate creature of the stage, and in the first few minutes of ""Misery,"" which is directed by Will Frears without enough attention to those old-fashioned fundamentals, you can enjoy her fussy, annoying Annie. In those early scenes, she's a carefully wrought Metcalf creation, credibly rooted in a certain reality - you feel, as you should, like you have met this Annie on a prior occasion.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,11/15/2015
Misery,7,Misery: EW stage review,"However, though the technical specs are excellent, the production suffers from a curious lack of tension. And, moreover, fun. The movie version had the benefit of close-ups, which Reiner took advantage of to the hilt, but in the play we feel too distanced from the intimacy and battle of wills that develops between Paul and Annie - or the notes of sympathy that is woven into each of them. Willis plays Paul with a flatness and passivity that feels too inert, even for a character who is bedbound. And as Annie, Laurie Metcalf is overly conscious of not echoing the line readings as they were delivered by Bates. During Annie's famous freak-out over Paul's decision to kill off his literary creation (""You murdered my Misery!""), Metcalf chooses the opposite tonal delivery for each of Bates' lines. And unlike in the book and the film, there's no grace period in which we discover that Annie is nuts. That's a symptom of making a play from material that is extremely well known, but it renders a great-looking production somewhat - to use a word - hobbled.

But there's a strong whiff of cynicism about the enterprise.

Somebody knows something, because the reviews won't matter here. Willis will either decide Broadway was a bad idea or dive into something better down the road.

Very little conflict unreels in our presence...It's hard to figure what Mamet is up to...But eventually you can't help facing the fact that Mamet has built what plot there is around the hypocrisy and venality of liberal politicians; the story is rigged to make Mickey, of all people, a victim...Anyway, China Doll doesn't provide convincing evidence even for its own case study, and Pacino's star quality prevents us from inferring any evidence on our own...This gives the play the air of a one-percenter paranoiac fantasy...Whatever one thinks of that sort of attitude as policy, as the basis of a drama it's disastrous.",Vulture,Jesse Green,12/04/2015

Bartlett takes a far less sentimental approach than did screenwriter/playwright Peter Morgan in the Mirren vehicles; he demands of an audience a more sophisticated understanding of how a constitutional monarchy functions, and expects us to have some intellectual curiosity about this eccentric man, nearing 70, who's been waiting his entire life to take the throne.",Washington Post,Peter Marks,11/01/2015
King Charles III,9,"Theater Review: The Difference Between Ruling and Governing, in King Charles III","As the use of blank verse suggests, Bartlett aims to dress up the skeeviness of this speculative royal-watching in Shakespearean grandeur, and he mostly succeeds. The iambic pentameter is supple and amusing (""But here's my husband, he's been on the phone"") even if it depends a bit too much on auxiliary verbs to fill out the lines. The scene-closing couplets, the elaborately extended metaphors, the near quotations (""Say more.

Bloodlust hasn't sung so sweetly, or provided so much theatrical fun, since Sweeney Todd first wielded his razor with gusto many a long year ago...Mr. Mays won a Tony Award for playing multiple roles in the Pulitzer Prize-winning solo show ""I Am My Own Wife,"" but the chameleonic performance he gives here makes even that feat seem simple - a matter of filing your nails while whistling ""Edelweiss,"" say. In a true tour de force that is hardly likely to be bettered on Broadway this season (apologies to the magnificent Mark Rylance, and those two knights, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, performing Beckett and Pinter in repertory), Mr. Mays sings, dances, ice-skates, bicycles and generally romps through some eight roles - flipping among personas male, female and somewhere in between - at a pace that sets your head spinning...As each precise caricature of British snootiness or silliness comes bounding onto the stage, Mr. Mays seems to be challenging himself to elicit bigger laughs, and he almost always succeeds.

As Monty Navarro, he has more than a bit of the imp in him - as if he were Marty Feldman's younger, much better looking brother. Plus he possesses a sumptuous singing voice. Taking over for Guinness, Jefferson Mays can now claim title to the most oft-murdered man in Broadway history. He does Guinness one better, playing not just eight but nine characters.

Dames at Sea,6,Aisle View: 'Dames' on Broadway,"Skinner directs Dames at Sea as well, but it is his choreography which keeps the show on its toes from beginning to end. He has stacked the deck with an ingratiating cast, including two standout performances. So there is plenty for musical comedy audiences to be happy about, especially at a time when there is nothing else on Broadway in this category...The big joke, in the case of Dames at Sea, was that the creators -- along with a cast of six and designers working with a crimped budget in a crimped space -- were giving us a tongue-in-cheek, postage-stamp version of those Warner Bros. movie musicals of the 1930s...The surprise, today, is that the show remains viable; this first Broadway production is impeccably staged and loaded with entertainment, and should delight its target audience.",Huffington Post,Steven Suskin,10/22/2015
Dames at Sea,5,Review: Broadway's 'Dames at Sea' all at sea — in the past,"It's taken almost half a century for ""Dames at Sea"" to come to Broadway. There really was no rush. This insubstantial musical, which sits awkwardly between celebration and parody, opened Thursday at the Helen Hays Theatre like a riff off a long-forgotten joke. And its bad identity crisis lets down one of the most hard-working casts in the business...It's the 1960s laughing at the 1930s, but in this century, it comes off as hopelessly hidebound. The music by Jim Wise is so light and derivative that it leaves no mark on the brain or heart...The show is weighed down by references to old stars...Randy Skinner directs and choreographs very tidily, keeping the hijinks bright, the hoofing electric and the ""Golly gee willickers"" delivered at a rosy, Technicolor level...But while everyone is sweating up a storm, the purpose is unclear. The dames are all at sea.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,10/22/2015
Dames at Sea,5,'Dames at Sea' review: Musical not 'Sea' worthy,"In a mind-boggling move, the show (which has not aged all that well) is being revived on Broadway, where it is uncomfortably out of place...The score has a few hummable melodies, but it's hardly top-drawer work. The jokes, which were intended for a gentler sensibility and an audience that was familiar with the 1930s films being evoked, land flat, as do all the references to celebrities from the period. Staged by director-choreographer Randy Skinner with lots of pep but little personality, the hardworking six-member cast tries to overcome the lackluster material by aggressively playing up the campiness, to the point of relentless irritation.",amNY,Matt Windman,10/22/2015
Dames at Sea,5,‘Dames at Sea’ Broadway Review: A Spoof of Classic Hollywood Musicals That’s More Numbing Than Fun,"In 2015, how are we supposed to enjoy ""Dames at Sea""...?...With its modest cast of just six, the show doesn't even attempt to replicate Berkeley's big art-deco productions numbers...What we're left with in ""Dames at Sea"" are the plots of movies like ""Footlight Parade"" and ""The Golddiggers of 1933""...In the new revival of ""Dames at Sea,"" Eloise Kropp and Cary Tedder play Ruby and Dick, respectively. Unlike Keeler, Kropp can sing and dance; unlike Powell, Tedder probably won't go on to play Philip Marlowe...Book writers George Haimsohn and Robin Miller make jokes that play on the leading man's name or that rhyme Louis XIV with V.I.P. It's not fun to feel superior to such material; it's numbing. As for Jim Wise's ""Dames at Sea"" score, quick: Hum a tune from this nearly 50-year-old musical. The repetition of the music is in a contest only with the repetition of the Dick jokes.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,10/22/2015
Dames at Sea,5,Broadway bummers: Musical 'Dames at Sea' and N.J.-set 'Ripcord' disappoint,"Originally staged in 1966, but never before on Broadway, ""Dames at Sea"" is a spoof of those old-fashioned, Depression-era ""backstage"" musicals...It's one of those wink-wink, nudge-nudge shows...that seeks to make fun of corny Broadway conventions, all the while luxuriating in the cornfields...Even the silliest spoof, though, demands a measure of humility, whereas from the shrill opening number, ""Wall Street,"" ""Dames at Sea"" is pitched at those sitting in the balcony of the theater across the street. The frantic pacing never allows us develop even the slightest emotional connection to the characters, and the brassy, cutesy songs...soon start to blur together. Points to the impressive cast of six, especially in the breathless tap dancing numbers...But a little of this elbowing-in-the-ribs goes an awfully long way.",NJ.com,Christopher Kelly,10/22/2015
Dames at Sea,4,"'Dames at Sea' review: One-joke show sinks, 47 years later","So the current big-time revival does what its late creators -- composer Jim Wise, author/lyricists George Haimsohn and Robin Miller -- apparently wanted their modest takeoff to accomplish. The production, directed and choreographed by Randy Skinner, has a hard-tapping, hardworking cast of six and enough varieties of I-love-to-dance smiles to become their own emoticons. What the musical does not have -- in addition to a breakout ingénue to elevate the unrelentingly, cheerfully lame nonsense -- is charm. This is, to put it gently, a one-joke show.

No need for heavenly choir music, though, because the reception the play deserves is the one it gets nightly at the Booth: roars of gleeful laughter. Some have wondered whether Robert Askins's outrageous dark comedy-about a sweet Christian teen, Jason (Steven Boyer), and his demonic puppet, Tyrone-would work as well in a larger venue as in its two hit Off Broadway runs. The answer is a resounding, full-throated yes.

Though uproariously funny at times, the serious-minded production will have the more squeamish playgoers averting their eyes at the bloody and desperate climax...In order for Broadway to seriously claim itself to be the heart of American theatre, more plays like this need to be produced there regularly. Hollywood stars and pop music icons may bring in the crowds, but nothing beats good writing, adventurous ideas and major attitude.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,04/07/2015

He's found his match in actor Steven Boyer, who plays Tyrone, the star of Broadway's bonkers new comedy ""Hand to God,"" with manic, demented intensity...But it's Boyer's virtuosic performance that defines ""Hand to God,"" as he seamlessly toggles between Jason and Tyrone - and if the actor doesn't win a Tony for this, there's no justice in this world. Boyer endows a sock puppet with fabulous expressiveness. Just watch how the little fellow's arms shake with rage when he reaches out to strangle someone - it's simultaneously hilarious and scary, like the play itself.",NY Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,04/07/2015
Hand to God,9,First Nighter: Robert Askins's Hand to God Deserves a Big Hand,"Tyrone is a puppet with sharp teeth that lives at the end of the right arm belonging to timid Jason (Steven Boyer). The fabric creature struts his considerable stuff in Hand to God, Robert Askins's career-making play that has now and for all the best reasons been transferred from off-off-Broadway to off-Broadway to Broadway, at the Booth...Boyer -- who resembles Irving Penn's photographs of the young Truman Capote -- is giving a career-making performance every bit equal to Askins's work. He's utterly captivating, utterly heart-breaking in his transition from a shy boy with a puppeteering inclination to a terrified young man in possibly unbreakable thrall to a virtually autonomous bully who's not reluctant to declare himself the Devil...The truth is, that the Hand to God assault on religion as irrevocable healer both tickles the ribs and gives them a powerful punch.",Huffington Post,David Finkle,04/07/2015

It wraps its seriousness in a veneer of XXX-rated irreverence. I don't know which I want to do more: Sing Hallelujah - or wash its dirty little mouth out with soap...Smaller in scale, song-free and purposely looking as though it was produced on a Cookie Monster-sale budget, Hand To God is a Book Of Revelations about what should be possible on Broadway, that one-time cultural bazaar that has come more and more to resemble a high-priced mausoleum...the best reason to make your way to the Booth Theatre is to see the most astonishing pair of performances by a single actor since Nina Arianda's Broadway debut in Venus In Fur...Praise Ensemble Studio Theater for the development production, MCC Theater for pushing Hand To God to the next level and a pack of producers led by Kevin McCollum for believing there's a place on Broadway for transgressive humor.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,04/07/2015
Hand to God,9,'Hand to God': Theater Review,"Bold new American plays by unestablished dramatists too seldom make it to Broadway, so this commercially risky endeavor - a challenge approached head-on by producers in their amusing marketing campaign ­- is to be applauded. The show also brings a welcome breath of fresh air via a director, Moritz von Stuelpnagel, new to the commercial theater mainstream, and a talented ensemble of five actors, only one of whom, Marc Kudisch, is a Broadway regular. The sharp production has evolved over two hit off-Broadway incarnations, increasing in size with each move, and it now sits quite snugly in the still-intimate confines of the Booth Theatre...Director von Stuelpnagel and his terrific cast tackle this darkly funny material with a shrewd balance of heightened reality, warped sitcom and underlying pathos, landing all the jokes while never denying the genuine sorrow and anger driving both Jason and Margery to such erratic behavior...The five actors couldn't be better...But the real virtuoso performance is Boyer's. Whether trembling with fear as the deeply unhappy, reedy-voiced Jason or with power-crazed tyranny, wild irreverence and thundering rage as Tyrone, he creates two entirely distinct characters that give the illusion of existing independently of one another. Together, they somehow add up to one messed-up but affectingly real kid. Forgive the pun, but Boyer deserves a big hand.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/07/2015
Hand to God,9,'Hand to God' theater review,"""Hand to God"" -- a dark, irreverent and smart comedy by the young, previously unknown playwright Peter Askins -- is one hell of a great success story, having graduated step by step from off Off-Broadway to Off-Broadway to finally Broadway itself. This is the kind of raw and raunchy play you don't typically see on Broadway, but once there ends up making Broadway a more exciting place...Yet despite how silly it gets, ""Hand to God"" is also a seriously disturbing portrait of an emotionally scarred mother and son who have spent so long suppressing their rage that it comes out in unpredictable and inappropriate ways.",amNY,Matt Windman,04/07/2015
Hand to God,8,Hand to God review – blasphemous puppet show is a filthy triumph,"It's not a lot more irreverent than The Book of Mormon, but it is a lot dirtier and there are no dance numbers. Askins's script, directed by Moritz von Stuelpnagel, often betrays an adolescent desire to shock and scandalise. Monologues that open and close the show spell out the religious critique too baldly. Some of the motivations are explained away tidily and a lot of the humour is puerile. But the puerile bits are particularly funny. (Though be forewarned: puppet fellatio is something you can't unsee.) Askins is smart and engaged enough that even the play's most outrageous actions seem grounded in character. Speaking of characters and those who play them, if Steven Boyer's name isn't on the best actor ballot come Tony time, then those awards are broken. Boyer, a slight and moon-faced blond who looks at least a decade younger than he is, plays both Jason and Tyrone, most often at the same time.",Guardian,Alexis Soloski,04/07/2015
Hand to God,8,Theater Review: Hand To God,"If you're religious, you might see Tyrone as the Devil; if you're psychologically inclined, you'll regard him as the uncorking of Jason's repressed id, an escape hatch for sorrow and confusion. Either way, Boyer's performance - remarkable both for his acting and his dexterity - is a sight to behold. Under the direction again of Moritz von Stuelpnagel, ""Hand to God"" seemed to me better than it was off-Broadway - faster, rowdier and more assured. If its message of human folly doesn't register as profoundly as playwright Askins seems to have intended, it's still a very clever, extremely entertaining show.",Bergen Record,Robert Feldberg,04/07/2015
Hand to God,8,Broadway review: 'Hand To God',"God may have created the heavens and the earth and all living things -- but the Devil surely created Tyrone, the filthy-minded, foul-mouthed sock puppet that has audiences howling at ""Hand to God."" Robert Askins' furiously funny comedy about adolescent rebellion against religious cant has made a smooth passage from workshop (at Ensemble Studio Theater) to Off Broadway (in an MCC production) to Broadway. Moritz von Stuelpnagel hasn't touched a hair on the head of his clever production and the original cast is still golden. At 800 seats, the intimate Booth proves extremely hospitable to this fiendish little satire of all things holy.",Boston Herald,Gordon Cox,04/07/2015
Hand to God,8,Review: ‘Hand to God’ Features a Foul-Talking Puppet,"In a Broadway season dominated by the usual fodder - musicals new and old, and a healthy serving of Important British Dramas - Mr. Askins's black comedy about the divided human soul, previously seen in two separate Off Broadway runs, stands out as a misfit both merry and scary, and very welcome...Mr. Boyer's performance as Jason is tender and touching, his performance as Tyrone outlandish and hilarious; put them together and you have that rarely seen (although often hailed) acting achievement: a true tour de force...What makes the play so sneakily resonant is how Mr. Askins exposes the base impulses, the sexual, self-destructive, potentially violent ones, that just about everyone harbors to some small degree... Pick up a newspaper and you read another grim report about men and women little older than Jason succumbing to far more destructive passions. Maybe if more of the world's troubled youth discharged their demons with the help of sock puppets, things might not look so grim.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,04/07/2015
Hand to God,8,Review: 'Hand to God' brings irreverent laughs to Broadway,"The story of a teenager who may or may not have a possessed puppet on his arm, Robert Askins' ""Hand to God"" is a rare truly communal dramatic experience, with the power to make an audience collectively shake with laughter, gasp in shock and rise to a giddy ovation...But the gleefully profane piece has already proven itself as a hit, and it lives up to its reputation...Boyer, who recently played the Fool in ""King Lear"" at the Public Theater, is a virtuosic puppeteer as well as a sensitive actor. He's sympathetic as the broken, painfully shy Jason and spot-on as the tough-talking Tyrone. The wild energy and precision with which he switches between the two personalities is stunning.",Star-Ledger,Ronnie Reich,04/07/2015
Hand to God,8,A hellish sock puppet petrifies in 'Hand to God',"...In this highly original and laudably fearless and politically incorrect piece - far indeed from the usual fare here - playwright Robert Askins has essentially taken this performance tradition further...Von Stuelpnagel's cast certainly goes everywhere this piece asks it to go, but the actors also convey a sense of ordinary folks struggling with the chaos that life can suddenly inflict on us all, whether it's in the form of troubled teenagers or bereavement or unfulfilled desire. That compassion is what takes ""Hand to God"" beyond the usual condescension you find on Broadway toward Texans or people of faith in general...Boyer, the remarkable star of this enterprise, is thoroughly believable at every moment...""",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/07/2015

Hand to God,8,"‘Hand to God’ review: Steven Boyer devilishly good in Robert Askins' smart, funny, foul-mouthed comedy","The new Broadway comedy ""Hand to God"" is so ridiculously raunchy, irreverent and funny it's bound to leave you sore from laughing. Ah, hurts so good...As in two earlier downtown runs of the show, Steven Boyer stars as Jason, and his acting and puppeteering are exceptional. Watching him do battle against his own dark side - Tyrone appears to yank him like a rag doll - is as good as physical comedy gets. It can't be outdone - and shouldn't be missed...But Askins, in his Broadway debut, proves deft at writing dialogue that's hysterical and at serving up insights about organized religion and family dysfunction. He's unapologetically profane - prompting a handful of walkouts after a line about body fluids at a recent performance. Their loss. Ultimately, Askins gets to what pain does to people. All the characters - even the cloth one - are up to their eyeballs in agony. Under the direction of Moritz von Stuelpnagel, the production zips by. It's not typical Broadway fare, but all involved deserve a big hand.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,04/07/2015
Hand to God,7,‘Hand to God’ Theater Review: Humans Are Here Simply to Service Their Puppets,"Since Askins possesses such a warped sense of humor, he'll probably take this as a compliment, but by far the most interesting characters in ""Hand to God"" are the puppets, not the humans. Except for Timothy, they aren't that vivid, although Stiles is outrageously droll when it comes to having her hand puppet Jolene service Tyrone...""Hand to God"" is a good night in the theater, but it does not offer the consistently inspired insanity of Christopher Durang's ""Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike,"" wherein all the characters rivet us with their individual madness. The big difference, of course, is that Durang is a veteran and Askins, at age 34, is making his Broadway debut. The theater of the absurd (or the ridiculous, the bizarre, or whatever it's being called today) is in good hands, and the mantle has been passed to very capable hands.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,04/07/2015
Hand to God,7,"'Hand to God' review: A devilish sock puppet, and sex","Last spring Off-Broadway, ""Hand to God"" was a wicked little church satire about a small-town Texas teen whose sock puppet is possessed by the devil. Improbably pumped up for Broadway, with a lot more yelling and joke-pounding, the offbeat reverence shrinks in charm and impact. Robert Askins' gory yet sweet-natured spoof feels more like a drawn-out sketch, and the gleeful dirty-talk gets childish when hammered by good actors encouraged to shriek. Despite the bible ripping and the ""have-a-blessed-day"" pieties, however, ""Hand to God"" is as much about religion as ""Avenue Q"" is about Sesame Street. Both are just diving boards to bounce dangerous thoughts into safe water.",Newsday,Linda Winer,04/07/2015
Hand to God,7,Theater Review: Hypocrites and a Vicious Sock Puppet in Hand to God,"...the dark comedy more nearly approaches its darkness in Act Two, with the consequences of human outrageousness brought to the foreground, the tale becomes more emotionally legible, and at times even heartbreaking. It's a credit to the director, Moritz von Stuelpnagel, and the performers, especially Geneva Carr as Margery and Marc Kudisch as Pastor Greg...Steven Boyer, whose role is almost too dimensional for its own good. Although he tosses off with admirable ease the daunting challenge of playing both Jason and Jason-as-Tyrone, often in furious conversation with one another, there is something unsatisfying in the role's construction that he cannot quite overcome. Usually an actor must integrate the various strands of information suggested by the play's conflicts in order to create a coherent character. Here, the character is created by segregation: All the showy, aggressive traits get put into Tyrone, all the sadness and delicacy into Jason. As a result, the more Boyer succeeds, the less either half of his success resonates...",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/07/2015
Hand to God,7,"For One Young Man, an Idle Hand is the Devil's Workshop","Boyer so skillfully separates the roles of awkward teen and possessed puppet you can forget you're watching just one performer.

There are only so many ways we can be told that faith isn't quite enough, and that we need to find specific ways of dealing with our problems...""Hand to God"" helped me finally see the allure in using a puppet to express feelings. It offers distance from ourselves, enabling us to say what we mean-what we feel-without tripping over the baggage that makes it hard to be a human: Will what I say hurt feelings? Is it morally dicey? Is it perverted? There's obviously some Tyrone in all of us. Praise the devil he's found a way to be heard?",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,04/07/2015

This truly is one of those must-see performances that will stick with you for some time. Broderick gives the sort of cartoonish, oddball performance previously seen in shows such as ""The Producers"" and last year's ""It's Only a Play,"" but it works unusually well here, and he has terrific chemistry with Ashford.

But there's something sunshiny and genuinely irrepressible about her that transcends any species categories...The director Daniel Sullivan can't teach it many new tricks, but he can give it a typically adroit and able production. Broderick, who sometimes underplays his roles, is a glove-like fit for the moony, diffident Greg...But make no mistake, it's Ashford's play.

In 1995, I wrote, ""Sylvia becomes the route through which Greg divorces everything meaningless in his life; it's significant that that does not include Kate."" Robert Sella plays three increasingly annoying characters - Bowser's male owner, a society doyenne and an ambisexual shrink - whose comic relief is vulgar, unnecessary and overdrawn.

Gurney's clever and off-beat 1995 comedy, Sylvia. On the surface, the play is about a married man in Manhattan who bonds with a stray dog in Central Park who has a tag around her neck saying Sylvia, and takes her home, much to the consternation of his wife. As scripted, Sylvia is played by a woman dressed in normal clothing that merely suggests her identity as a dog. And while the play is a breezy, hip and sentimental comedy, there's always the visual subtext of a young woman happily and unconditionally fawning over the older man who keeps her at the end of a leash.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,10/27/2015

She's off and running...Daniel Sullivan directs with howling success...Ashford...captures the playful, naughty essence of a dog without being led a-stray by camp...For all the doggie brilliance, there's a fourth member of the cast -- a rubber-faced Robert Sella -- who is of a different breed, entirely.

As is Ashford, who has created an endearing persona that's equal parts doggy charm and girly sex appeal...In helmer Daniel Sullivan's super-slick production, everybody pitches in to sustain the illusion that the soul of a shaggy dog can live in the shapely body of a gifted comic actress...As long as we can sit back and laugh at Sylvia's doggy antics while admiring Ashford's comic flair, ""Sylvia"" is harmless fun.

That reward is for realizing twinkly Annaleigh Ashford could so dynamically inhabit the title role in ""Sylvia""...As a labrador-poodle mix who nuzzles up to a middle-aged schlub (Matthew Broderick) in Central Park and awakens him to life's possibilities -- while almost destroying his marriage -- Ashford pounces into a potentially fraught role and comes out gleaming...Ashford is put into every canine trope conceivable (Sylvia is neutered!) and manages it without being cloying, a crucial matter for a play that's already got some behavioral problems...It was comforting to see stage vet Broderick more at ease than he was last season in ""It's Only a Play."" His chemistry with Ashford is swell.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,10/27/2015
Sylvia,8,Sylvia: EW stage review,"Ashford is no one-trick canine, but those now-signature performance quirks...lend themselves to the spontaneous, indecisive, and rambling nature of Sylvia, whom Ashford plays with thoughtfulness and teenage vacuity somewhere between Snoopy and Kesha. With director Daniel Sullivan's license, Ashford is spry and spasmodic in channeling the animal's feral energy. Eventually, the physical half of the big ""joke"" -- that is, human playing dog in earnest -- wears thin, but Ashford rescues herself from her own plateaus with bursts of sudden enthusiasm...Broderick gives the same pathos-less performance he's been offering since 2012's Nice Work If You Can Get It, a sleepy stroll that fits with Greg's stubborn, oblivious, and altogether aggravating lack of awareness...Even to the most pessimistic, Sylvia is innocuous and zippy, surprisingly foul-mouthed, and perhaps the very definition of disarmingly funny.",Entertainment Weekly,Marc Snetiker,10/27/2015
Sylvia,7,‘Sylvia’ Broadway Review: Matthew Broderick Must Choose Between Smart Wife or Sexy Talking Pooch,"All of this gimmickry -- some of it written into the play, some of it resulting from Sullivan's direction -- wouldn't matter if the characters, the dog included, weren't so dull. Larry David's very popular and critically trashed ""Fish in the Dark"" from last season displayed more wit in five minutes than Gurney gives us in two-plus hours...The wimpy Broderick and the dynamic White don't belong on the same stage, much less in the same marriage. Her bundle of neuroses, fun to watch in other shows, doesn't fit this level-headed character...Broderick turns yet another character into an eternal adolescent, his voice occasionally sliding up to an F above middle C for the wispiest of comic effects...Ashford's sexy pooch is much snarkier than Parker's. It's the difference between what you want in a pet: an ersatz Madonna or the real Sarah Jessica Parker.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,10/27/2015
Sylvia,7,Theater Review: Annaleigh Ashford Is Sylvia’s Search-and-Rescue Dog,"Unfortunately, this fantastic comic challenge is a dramaturgical disaster. To begin with, the rules of Sylvia's doghood are unclear and chaotically enforced. At first her English is presented as an approximation of what a human might think a dog is thinking: Barks are rendered as ""Hey! Hey! Hey!"" and soulful stares as ""I want to sit near you."" Sometimes, wittily enough, Sylvia responds to Greg's philosophizing with deflections like, ""I wish I could contribute something here, but I just plain can't."" At other times, though, Sylvia speaks like a normal person, and the other characters talk to her in the expectation that she will understand them specifically and rationally. Is she becoming more human, as Ann Roth's witty canine-human crossbreed fashions, moving from a furry sweater and velour bodysuit to a black cocktail dress, seem to suggest? Then why does she switch back to the furry sweater later? I suppose this is all covered under a general talking-animal-comedy indemnification policy, but it does add to the ad hoc feeling of the play, as if it were built to stand for only the two hours it takes to perform and not a second longer. At the stroke of ten, no matter how many shout-outs to Shakespeare it has offered, and despite the lovely Cole Porter tune jammed in for no reason, it collapses instantaneously.",Vulture,Jesse Green,10/27/2015
Sylvia,7,"Review: ‘Sylvia,’ in Which a Man Loves a Dog Too Much","Ms. Ashford...makes for an exceptionally comely and understandably appealing pet...Mr. Gurney's comedy rests on this critter acting almost as human as the humans...Of course, the most robust humor in the play derives from watching Ms. Ashford bound around the stage causing trouble of various kinds and acting in true doglike fashion...I can find no fault with Ms. Ashford's frisky, energetic and inventive performance, but Mr. Broderick has become something of a frustrating puzzle. For more than 10 years now, he has been turning in variations on the same coy performance, employing a curdled, boyish and weirdly artificial voice...As Greg...Mr. Broderick gives a fine performance as a gentle, loving man coming slightly unmoored. But the voice kept pulling me out of the performance...Although Daniel Sullivan shapes the performances nicely, this veteran director doesn't exactly add to the luster of his long career here...",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,10/27/2015
Sylvia,6,"'Sylvia' on Broadway: Matthew Broderick stars in comedy that's all bark, no bite","""Sylvia"" is very sweet and very slight -- a valentine to dogs and the owners they have wrapped around their paws. And, indeed, whenever the tireless Ashford is on stage -- one moment cursing up a storm at an off-stage cat, the next contriving ways to climb atop Greg and Kate's furniture -- this production strikes just the right balance between sentimental and silly. Too often, though, that balance is upended...Broderick adopts a puzzling, Ward Cleaver-like affect -- as if he's playing the idea of an American middle age man instead of an actual character. We never quite believe his Greg is married to White's Kate, and so it's impossible to invest emotionally in the marital crisis Sylvia supposedly causes.",NJ.com,Christopher Kelly,10/27/2015
Sylvia,6,Ashford and Broderick play dog and man in 'Sylvia' on Broadway,"...Broderick does not really show us a vulnerable guy on some kind of journey...[he] is pretty much the same at the end as he is at the beginning: He delivers his lines with much the same cadence in both acts, which can be funny in a technical sense, but does not move us much of anywhere, dramatically speaking, nor provide the requisite complexity of relationship..That's not to say ""Sylvia"" has no laughs...Ashford navigates many of the pitfalls of this role well -- her doggy is a detailed set of observations, and her crotch nuzzling, couch laying, sitting, begging and the rest are all executed with amusing aplomb on a romantic Central Park-themed set from David Rockwell that tacitly acknowledges the retro, patriarchal nature of the play.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,10/27/2015
Sylvia,6,'Sylvia': Theater Review,"When Ashford enters the elegant Manhattan apartment of Broderick's Greg and his English teacher wife Kate (a miscast Julie White), it's impossible not to be charmed by the anthropomorphized pooch. She bounds around and over furniture, gamboling with uncontainable delight in her new home, sniffing every inch of the place and dragging her butt across the carpet while panting with the urgency of finding adequate ways to express her unquestioning adoration. The writing, direction and performance could only have come from years of doggy devotion...But once the rambunctious dog impersonation has worked its initial magic, it soon becomes apparent that the play is a very shallow bowl of kibble.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,10/27/2015

But not quite enough to sustain two hours. Director Daniel Sullivan has a light touch with his a tightknit ensemble, but the play is undercooked and overlong. Still, there are pleasures. Annaleigh Ashford (""Masters of Sex"") makes an adorable talking stray mutt...she affirms her stature as a comic ace...Matthew Broderick gives his most assured performance in a long while as Greg, an unhappily employed middle-aged empty-nester who finds Syliva in the park and becomes obsessed.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,10/27/2015
Fool For Love,9,"Review: ‘Fool for Love,’ a Kinship That Breaks Hearts and Knuckles","Love as a battlefield on which nobody wins has seldom been mapped as thrillingly as it is in Daniel Aukin's definitive revival of this bruising drama from 1983. That's in large part because as the inexorably coupled May and Eddie, Nina Arianda and Sam Rockwell exude the sort of chemistry from which nuclear meltdowns are made. But every ingredient that's gone into this Manhattan Theater Club and Williamstown Theater Festival offering has been measured, sifted and distilled to create the most potent combination conceivable...Ms. Arianda and Mr. Rockwell, wild-card stars who here fulfill every promise of their earlier careers, provide plenty of injury-courting action as they bounce off the walls of Dane Laffrey's last-chance motel room set...But this production also makes it clear that ""Fool for Love"" has a lot more going for it than its adrenaline quotient.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,10/08/2015

The actress...has never had trouble holding a stage, or dominating one. Here, she reveals the desperation and shame of a woman who wants to exert her independence but cannot, and her final resignation is harrowing. Rockwell deftly mines the vulnerability and humor behind the menace Eddie shows us initially.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,10/08/2015
Fool For Love,9,"After an Absence, Nina Arianda and Sam Rockwell Discover They're Crazy in Love","Rockwell, the reliable movie actor celebrated as much for his supporting roles as his leading ones, is part action, part talk -- and far more skilled with a lasso than we'd have any right to expect...Rockwell comes on as a wiseacre at first, something like Brad Pitt in ""Thelma & Louise,"" trying to assure Arianda's May he just wants her to be happy. He gets cockier as he goes, and it's a very nifty, physical performance...Arianda, the Tony winner of ""Venus in Fur,"" is hot-tempered and emotional, yet her performance all fits well within the bounds of Shepard's economical prose. The idea is to portray her -- purposefully -- as the stock, blousy working-class woman who's been in abusive relationship and has finally decided she can't take it anymore...""Fool for Love"" is classic Shepard: Family dysfunction, a Western setting and some dark and twisted stuff leading up to a big reveal (or two).

Here, though, Rockwell and Arianda gleefully tear into one another, generating palpable sexual tension and nailing the grimly comic underbelly of Shepard's dialogue. The director, Daniel Aukin, strikes just the right notes of urgency and uncertainty; even if you've seen ""Fool for Love"" before, you feel as if you have no idea what's coming next.

Leong) consist mainly of one lover throwing the other against the wall or across the bed -- although Eddie adds his signature touch of twirling a lasso...His legs bowed and his posture a perpetual slouch, Rockwell is so genuinely invested in this cowboy role that anyone would take him for the real thing...""Fool for Love"" is far more physical than other plays by Shepard, and physicality is Arianda's strong suit. The actress has a remarkably supple back, which she uses in expressive ways -- curled in on itself like a beaten puppy, or hunched in a corner like a rabid dog.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,10/08/2015

Physically, it is just about perfect, especially the lighting design by Justin Townsend, which creates its poetic effects (as the play does) from the most concrete situations. Arianda's alternately spitfire and limpetlike fierceness has rarely been channeled as effectively, and Rockwell, a string bean in a cowboy hat, with a mean lasso and a mortifying chicken dance, brings tremendous vulnerability to a role often played as a brick.",Vulture,Jesse Green,10/08/2015
Fool For Love,8,Fool for Love,"...it's a welcome shock to see the actor stripped of all that allure in the opening tableau of Sam Shepard's Fool for Love, in which Arianda plays bucking bronco to Sam Rockwell's dusty cowpoke. Slumped on a motel bed in unflattering, baggy clothes, head slung low, this is Arianda as a broken doll, as trashed as the grubby room around her. She may spring to life with a furious attack and eventually pour herself into a little red number, but Arianda's May is not the glamor fest one expects. Just as surprising is Rockwell's Eddie...here he seems to dig deep into painful places for Eddie, a tight-lipped fellow whose leathery exterior hides a frightened boy...Daniel Aukin's painterly diorama production benefits from key support from a fine Tom Pelphrey as May's bemused beau and Gordon Joseph Weiss as a spectral old-timer who may have fathered both fractious lovers (there's a whisper of Greek tragedy amidst the tumbleweeds).

Directed by Daniel Aukin, it is fully worthy of her gifts, and the results are -- almost literally -- explosive. This show will make you sweat...Dane Laffrey, the set designer, has situated the action of the play in a shallow, low-ceilinged wooden box that forces Ms. Arianda and Mr. Rockwell to spend much of their time standing in profile to the audience. They look like a lanky pair of parentheses and act like two rabid dogs in heat. It's no knock on Mr. Rockwell, who delivers his big monologue with unemphatic but absorbing force, to point out that whenever Ms. Arianda is onstage, she's the one you look at and listen to. I wish she'd worked harder on her accent, but that doesn't matter too much: Every other part of her performance is scaldingly, unimpeachably real.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,10/08/2015

In fact, Rockwell doesn't just rope the furniture in director Daniel Aukin's hardworking physical production. The actor, who has clearly been practicing, also lassos Arianda...Although Arianda and Rockwell have the looks, the presence and the guts, there isn't the down-and-dirty chemistry that makes the fate of the lovers' long and conflicted relationship feel inevitable and dangerous...Suffice it to say that the violence feels phony and it's hard to get overheated about the fate of the characters.",Newsday,Linda Winer,10/08/2015

Since May doesn't get to speak every line of dialogue, Arianda spends the rest of her time on stage messing with her hair, braiding her hair, or pinning up her hair -- anything to keep our attention...With Arianda offstage, it's possible to notice Rockwell and Pelphrey, and to see that they're embodying their respective characters with understated grace.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,10/08/2015

But the revelation for me was Rockwell, who sheds new light on Eddie...Eddie is often portrayed as a Marlboro Man, a last holdout of the iconic West. Rockwell shows that he can lasso furniture as adroitly as any carnival cowboy, but there's a charming clumsiness to his characterization.

He knows she's bad for him and vice versa, but he can't keep away...As May...[Arianda] works her blonde mane and long legs to bewitching effect, proving no less physical a performer than Rockwell. But the volatile characterization seems more studied than lived-in. May clings like a vine to Eddie one minute and then breaks their passionate kiss with a knee to the groin the next, but the desperation behind her push-pull instability in this production is unpersuasive.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,10/08/2015

Friedman Theatre). The slamming, which produces a stereo boom you can feel in your organs, eventually becomes rote and numbing.

Ms. Reilly finds a little-girl petulance in Kate's seeming passivity, while Ms. Best's Anna is worldly to the point of vampishness. Mr. Owen underscores Deeley's beleaguered air of machismo with a self-parodying, lounge lizard swagger. This approach, verging on caricature, makes ""Old Times"" more obviously funny than it usually is, and the desperation within the triangle reads larger...Less felicitously, this more-is-more sensibility can also make the script seem self-parodyingly pretentious.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,10/06/2015

Owen's edgy, masculine charm and absurdist sense of humor are on show and Best, as Anna, is completely believable as the object of lust for at least one of her dinner companions.

In the new Roundabout Theatre Company production...director Douglas Hodge and a cast that includes Broadway newbie Clive Owen bring a darkly hypnotic pull to the challenging material. Having helmed and acted in Pinter's work extensively across the pond, Hodge understands the musicality of the language. The rhythms in Pinter's dialogue, punctuated by pauses, can be played at different tempos. There is a languid quality to this staging that, while seductive, doesn't always encourage the alert attention the text demands. Hodge does cull consistent, robust performances from his cast. As Kate, who speaks the least but gets the most attention, Kelly Reilly brings a perfect mix of elusiveness and quiet knowing. With her bell-like speaking voice and understated prettiness, Reilly is a compelling foil for the haughty glamour that Eve Best, excellent as always, brings to the more worldly Anna.

Hodge...chose to superimpose an over-animated, high-concept spectacle on a playwright whose menace radiates from silence and things unsaid...The drama, such as it is, is built on innuendo and insinuation, not overacting and special effects. Owen is deliciously slick, but not too slick, and, every so often, intentionally, fantastically obnoxious as Deeley...Eve Best...has an imposing elegance as the guest who married well, and Kelly Reilly, as the wife, has the quiet feline languor of one who feels the desire simmer off the others in the room...Printed scripts are not holy writs but, at least in this case, Pinter knew best.",Newsday,Linda Winer,10/06/2015

Owen is particularly strong as Keely, his suavity just short of convincing: perfect. Eve Best, a phenomenal stage actress (A Moon For The Misbegotten, Hedda Gabler) is cunning as Anna, and Reilly strikes exactly the right balance between unaffected blankness and someone who knows in her bones that she, ultimately, is the prize Keely and Anna are battling over. Hodge and company play the humor over the menace, which mostly works in this brief drama...Detracting from the whole is that set, which is framed by an abstract swirl of circles, and some introductory music by Thom Yorke that nearly had me bolting from the theater before the proceedings got under way. Once they did however, I was hooked.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,10/06/2015
Old Times,8,New York Review: OLD TIMES,"To borrow a great line from Harold Pinter's Homecoming: ""You never heard such silence,"" and in this brilliant Broadway production of Pinter's Old Times, directed by Douglas Hodge, the silences are simply deafening. The mysteries of memory, like the mysteries of marriage are the subjects of this elusive, tantalizing play but the great Sub-Texter himself, and this sleek and stylish British cast deepens the mysteries without ever solving them...The characters are isolated in space, silenced in mid-sentence, while jokey moments of coffee-sipping in unison and legs flung over chair arms break the tension momentarily. Similarly, the eerie electronic music by Thom Yorke and a sound design by Clive Goodwin bolster the atmosphere of dis-ease. Owen is sexy and swaggering and bewildered; Reilly, with her superb profile, is sexy and stern and unyielding; Best is sexy and opulent and, to use a word you don't hear much anymore, beguiling. All told is this a great and unnerving production.",Philadelpia Inquirer,Toby Zinman,10/06/2015
Old Times,7,'Old Times': Theater Review,"Clive Owen makes a riveting Broadway debut in Harold Pinter's Old Times, playing a man whose cocky suavity slowly unravels as he negotiates his hold on two elusive women, who may be different sides of the same person...But director Douglas Hodge doesn't make the mistake of imposing explanations where none were intended as he charts a transfixing course from gamesmanship to the consuming loss of a fantasy that was perhaps never attainable to begin with. Audience response will depend largely on the appetite for Pinter at his most opaque -- or some might even say attenuated. This is not a play with the biting menace of earlier landmark works like The Birthday Party...Its fascination is quieter and more cryptic, to the point where some will find it bloodless. Hodge, a seasoned Pinter interpreter as both actor and director, proclaims rather loudly from the outset that the drama is unfolding in a disorienting void adjacent to reality.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,10/06/2015
Old Times,7,Broadway Review: ‘Old Times’ Starring Clive Owen,"Director Douglas Hodge...has made some curious production choices, but once the erotic games begin, you hardly notice that the writer's signature pauses and ominous silences have been trimmed. The most baffling aspect of the production isn't the play's elusive meaning or Pinter's ambiguous dialogue -- it's the setting...what to make of that solid block of ice in the shape of a door that dominates the room, which itself takes a twirl on a turntable for no earthly reason? Or the eyeball-searing strobe lights and that giant psychedelic whirligig and the loud metallic assault on our ears? It's a blessed relief when things settle down and Pinter's seductive parlor game for grownups can begin in earnest. In Reilly's controlled performance as the play's most controlling character, Kate doesn't seem to be looking forward to a visit from an old friend she hasn't seen in years...Owen has perfected the smoldering, could-be dangerous look of an imperfectly civilized hoodlum, so it's a nice jolt when he drops his cool facade and jumps at the idea that Kate's old friend might provide some insights into his inscrutable wife...There's nothing reserved about Anna, who exudes that air of confidence that comes from being married to a rich man.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,10/06/2015

Owen, in his Broadway debut, is louche and bemused, at first pushing brandy on his wife's guest with cocky and jerky movements that seem particular to, well, Old Times ... or, at the very least, ""Mad Men."" Reilly uses her dreamlike gaze to fine effect as something of an introvert who doesn't like the way her husband bosses her around...The focal point of the production, though, is British actress Best.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,10/06/2015
Old Times,7,Theater Review: Trying to Make Pinter’s Old Times New Again,"Pinter means to keep the audience on its toes: There is detective work to be done, sorting out the relationships and alibis. The characters, both in their tastes and distastes, are perfectly etched...And, at a fleet 70 minutes with no intermission, the play smartly limits your exposure to the intense narcissism of people playing a game of erotic musical chairs. But for all its verbal brilliance and surgical precision in dissecting the characters' personalities, Old Times no longer feels quite real, if it ever did...if you see the play as a profound portrait of a permanent human condition, it's going to disappoint, which is exactly the trap Douglas Hodge's production falls into...He has encouraged an excellent cast...to play the subtext so broadly that it basically everts the drama, leaving very little sense that feasible humans are involved. Even so, the actors are good enough to make it fun: Owen a monkey on a hot tin roof, Best a Sicilian goddess, Reilly an impossibly sexy sphinx...But with neither the history nor the hostility very mysterious, the sum on this one-plus-one-plus-one plot is zero.",Vulture,Jesse Green,10/06/2015

But that's what director Douglas Hodge does with ""Old Times"" in this Roundabout production...In Hodge's ""Old Times,"" the actors aren't playing the subtext necessarily. They share a feverish imagination that doesn't have much to do with the text, but nonetheless illuminates it in quirky ways...Hodge and company emphasize that defiance...Owen, in his Broadway debut, gives us a Deeley who's not only soused from the get-go but fey in an attractively disheveled sort of way...For theatergoers who are tired of sitting through all those Pinter pauses, Hodge pushes his actors to speak rapid fire, often on top of each other; and when they do take a breath, it's much more than a pause. It's often a long, silent interlude in which they lounge around, smoke cigarettes, or strut as if readying themselves for the next barrage of words.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,10/06/2015
Old Times,7,Old Times,"Under the direction of Douglas Hodge...Owen plays a filmmaker called Deeley as tough but not threatening. He is no longer laddish, but wishes that he somehow still were, and Owen gives him just enough exposed nerve endings to make his final breakdown ignite believably...Erotic overtones are never absent for long in this 70-minute evening. As Kate, Reilly parades seductively in a high-waisted skirt and, as Anna, Best assumes sex-kitten stances in her slinky white silk outfit. Initially the actors appear more interested in posing than in acting, but eventually they form a true ensemble. Best and Owen have a natural chemistry, especially in the comic moments...I did, on the other hand, mind about the production's set...But the actors' skilful by-play helps blot out the images, as do the thumping snatches of original music supplied by Radiohead's Thom Yorke.",Financial Times,Brendan Lemon,10/06/2015

Combined with incidental music by Radiohead's Thom Yorke (industrial and menacing, as you'd expect), the mood is abstract, ghostly, interior. Problem is, the play already does all that: The designers are overdoing it...Owen and Reilly are quite good: He's coiled, boastful and sexy, with an edge of sleaze; she languorously transfers herself from divan to chair as if wafted by a draft, her sloe-eyed, sleepwalker presence belying a savage final attack. As the third wheel, Best, normally a steely presence, seems stranded between her costars' choices: too bland and self-contained when she should be spiky and aggressive...Despite overdetermined design and asymmetrical performances, Pinter's precise, lyrical language comes through with crystalized, cutting force.",TimeOut NY,David Cote,10/06/2015

Owen (""The Knick"") works his craggy good looks and is alternately rogueish and vulnerable. Reilly (""True Detective"") looks the picture of pretty melancholy with her perennially pursed lips, but eventually reveals a sharp tongue.

You're either mesmerized by his mysterious, menacing, pause-filled psychological dramas or you find them puzzling, inert and empty -- as I usually do. That being said, the Roundabout's new revival of his 1971 three-actor, 65-minute drama ""Old Times"" (which has an all-English cast and is directed by Tony-winning English actor Douglas Hodge) more than captures the playwright's distinctive style, packed with steel and sexiness.

It is now happening on Broadway, in a faintly compelling revival, directed by Douglas Hodge and starring Clive Owen, Eve Best and Kelly Reilly.

Culture is a bolt that ratchets in only one direction in the play: toward greater freedom and compassion. But the musical is not just soothing and includes clear depictions of the horrors of slavery. The show opens with the audience immediately implicated as eager auctioneers at a brutal slave auction. There are several on-stage whippings of black characters by white characters.

By then we've been on quite a journey with these characters, and the hymn resonates with relevance and hope, both for their personal stories and the still-uneasy state of racial relations today.""",Associated Press,Jennifer Farrar,07/16/2015
Amazing Grace,7,Broadway Review: ‘Amazing Grace’,"There's an audience out there for ""Amazing Grace,"" flawed as it is, but they may not get to see this religious-uplift musical if the $16 million show's marketing machine doesn't reach its target audience. Christian congregations and other faith-based groups should respond to this epic-scaled saga of how John Newton, an 18th-century British slave trader played byJosh Young, experienced a ""miraculous"" religious conversion, became an Anglican minister, and went on to write 200 church hymns, including the stirring title piece. But ye of little faith will find it tough sledding.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,07/16/2015
Amazing Grace,7,'Grace' Traces Path of Slave Trader Who Would Write a Celebrated Hymn,"More to the point, ""Amazing Grace"" focuses on Newton as a bratty young man in the 1740s, when he was truly the self-proclaimed ""wretch"" of that hymn's first stanza. The spiritual -- recently sung by the president at a eulogy for the Charleston shooting victims -- isn't heard until the musical's final moments. Writer Smith (sharing book credit with Arthur Giron) piles on a lot to explain why John is a rebellious man: His mother died when he was young ... His love interest, Mary (the appealing Erin Mackey, of ""Chaplin""), comes from a broken family that wants to marry her off to a pompous British major (Chris Hoch)...Because most of the relationships are musical theater tropes, they tend to drag on the pacing. The tone of scenes in the first act oscillates wildly, from striking and severe -- particularly the difficult images of chained slaves being branded -- to overly smug and smirky (Hoch is fun, though he seems to be channeling King George from ""Hamilton""). The songs are confident, if not quite memorable -- the best being ""Truly Alive,"" early on.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,07/16/2015

Hewitt and Mr. Cooper, both stalwart musical theater veterans, give forceful renderings of their minimally drawn characters.

Much good work has been done on ""Amazing Grace""...""Amazing Grace"" wants to tell the story of a conversion...But it feels rushed and unsatisfying, although not as sudden as the appearance of the title song at the conclusion of the night, even though we are hungry for more exploration of its genesis and legacy...he book, an overly linear piece of storytelling never better than serviceable that lacks nuance and ambiguity, even as the production it accompanies lacks a truly vibrant theatrical metaphor.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,07/16/2015

In this case, the program bio of Christopher Smith--""the concept creator, composer, lyricist and co-author of the book""--proudly states that this is his ""first work of professional writing.""

The much-celebrated Hand to God uses a demonic sock puppet to send up rigid distinctions between good and evil in a Christian community. And at last check, The Book of Mormon wasn't having any trouble selling tickets. If Grace has the courage of its convictions, it shows less daring, and little invention, as a creative work. With its mostly generic, sometimes bombastic score and stilted dialogue, this account of the pre-American Revolution U.K. can recall some of the more hot-air-filled musicals that invaded us from abroad (and some homegrown ones) in the '80s and '90s.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,07/16/2015

(He wrote the music and lyrics himself and co-wrote the book with the more experienced playwright Arthur Giron.) What he has somehow gotten produced, and offered with good intentions to Broadway audiences and critics, is the equivalent of a child's drawing: naïve, sincere, glowing with an unimpeachable if hard-to-pin-down vision of what it wants to be. (I'd guess that it wants to be a Christian family entertainment with a bold message about the power of redemption.) It is also a confusing cartoon so lacking in craft that it ruins any chance of being taken seriously.

The swift answer on both counts is that Harris is beyond fabulous, holds nothing back and plays it any way but safe in Michael Mayer's exhilarating production...Harris smoothly marries Borscht Belt shtick with a self-serious songspiel style reminiscent of Ute Lemper, spicing his performance with improvisational touches and audience exchanges ranging from flirty asides to a lap-dance.

The humor here is darker and rawer than the material that has endeared Harris to TV audiences, but he brings the same affable, slightly naughty charm -- only laced with the brittleness and jagged desperation you'd expect from someone who has been repeatedly betrayed by those she loves.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,04/22/2014

There is, after all, a bit of cognitive dissonance in a supposed outcast selling out a giant theater filled with fans screaming, 'I love you, Neil!' While director Michael Mayer's tricked-out production abandons the show's seedy origins, there's still a satirical edge that reflects the more upscale venue...Purists may balk at Harris' punk-lite vocals on Trask's infectiously rockin' score -- he's less Iggy, more pop -- and his threats to 'cut you, bitch' come off with more of a wink than actual menace. But in a bravura performance, the actor proves the perfect instrument for Hedwig's transition into world-class superstardom. He's honed his showmanship on four Tony Awards gigs, of course.

It's tempting to say -- and I'm giving in to the temptation -- that with his third obvious click, he's made himself our foremost director of rock musicals. Over the last several decades, too many of the so-called rock musicals have merely been ersatz. Mayer is expert at the real thing. The closing number ""Midnight Radio"" exhorts everyone to ""lift up your hands."" Not only will many Hedwig and the Angry Inch audience members lift up their hands, they'll eagerly and happily put then together for sustained applause.",Huffington Post,David Finkle,04/22/2014
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,8,‘Hedwig and the Angry Inch’: Theater review,"Transformation is tricky, sometimes even painful. But Broadway's sensational ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" starring a kick-ass Neil Patrick Harris is a reminder that change doesn't have to hurt. John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask's raucous pop-rock musical -- a show with proudly ratty downtown roots and rabid fans -- survives and thrives uptown. Allegories are elastic, after all. And, yes, this frisky, unapologetically raunchy fable of love, loss, fury and freedom is flashier on the Great White Way thanks to director Michael Mayer's gleaming production...Lean and mean NPH throws himself into the role and against the walls with reckless flip-your-wig and in-your-face abandonment. And he summons the wounded spirit and sense of yearning to which everyone can relate. That carries us along and makes us care for this odd character.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,04/22/2014
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,8,Neil Patrick Harris works his tail off onstage in ‘Hedwig’,"Sometimes you wonder if there's anything Neil Patrick Harris can't do: He switches from ""How I Met Your Mother"" to singing Sondheim on Broadway, directing a magic show to hosting any award ceremony you throw at him. And he makes it all look easy. Except, that is, Broadway's ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" in which he's working very hard -- and not just because he's onstage the entire show performing all of the songs. The strain we see is that of a show-tune guy trying on rock 'n' roll for size. That music's fury and danger don't come naturally to Harris, who fares a lot better in the show's more emotional scenes...Only when he finally clicks with the material -- as on the heartbreaking ""Wig in a Box,"" about the process of becoming someone else -- is the show suddenly worth the effort he's poured into it.",NY Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,04/22/2014
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,8,‘Hedwig and the Angry Inch’ Theater Review: Neil Patrick Harris Crosses Over to the Glam Side,"Hedwig, lead singer of the Angry Inch, is forever telling people how he gets down on his knees to give thanks. ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" opened Tuesday on Broadway at the Belasco Theatre, and its creators, John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask, should get down on their four knees to thank star Neil Patrick Harris and director Michael Mayer...Mayer might have kept a touch of that low-rent tawdriness, but no matter. He goes for the Ziggy Stardust/David Bowie glam that inspires Hedwig, and so turns Mitchell and Trask's little tuner into a big Broadway extravaganza that burns as hot as a bruised bottom after an especially rough night of S&M sex...And there is Harris, first and foremost. His voice is ideal for the three or four notes of Trask's songs. He's edgy, angry, bitchy and also very funny.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,04/22/2014

They have come to see Harris, a major American television star owing to How I Met Your Mother, give glam rock a workout. But the evening, even with the longueurs of its storytelling, manages to make us think about not just gender-based aspects of love but also the cold war, cheap American pop music, and the price of fame...A veteran not only of sitcoms but also of gender-bending stage shows such as Rent and Cabaret, Harris is ideally experienced to deliver Hedwig's low jokes as well as its rock 'n' roll kick-outs and tearful ballads.",Financial Times,Brendan Lemon,04/22/2014
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,8,Theater review: 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch',"Everyone knows Neil Patrick Harris is a versatile actor and singer. But in ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" which opened Tuesday night at the Belasco Theatre, his performance profile takes a visceral leap forward.

Inspired by a Socratic dialogue on the nature of love, this concert-style musical, with book by John Cameron Mitchell and music and lyrics by Stephen Trask, concerns Hedwig, a ""slip of a girly boy"" from East Germany who is brought to America as an army bride. Hedwig discovers a talent for songwriting and launches the career of a teen idol, who then rebuffs her. The Angry Inch is her surly Croatian band - as well as her sobriquet for the results of a botched sex-change operation.",Guardian,Alexis Soloski,04/22/2014
It Shoulda Been You,9,'It Shoulda Been You' is fresh and funny,"Yet this new musical, this Broadway season's freshest and funniest to date, defies skepticism, both in its wacky humor and its big, buoyant heart. Book writer and lyricist Brian Hargrove and composer Barbara Anselmi have taken a familiar premise -- that of lovers from different backgrounds uniting -- and crafted something that is both endearingly old-fashioned in spirit and decidedly contemporary in execution. Under the whip-smart direction of David Hyde Piece (Hargrove's husband), the 100-minute Shoulda Been can feel like a revival of some lost screwball classic. But Hargrove's hilarious lines, in song and dialogue, take liberties that wouldn't have flown back in the day...The message underlying this madness has to do with the importance of viewing others -- as individuals, in families and relationships -- with eyes wide open. And Pierce and his superb cast serve it with a delicacy befitting a fine soufflé.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,04/14/2015
It Shoulda Been You,8,Review: It Shoulda Been You' is inventive satire of weddings,"A good wedding might offer touching moments, tension, humor and perhaps some surprising revelations. All that and more is provided by the new musical ""It Shoulda Been You,"" a frequently funny satire of wedding mishaps. It's smartly staged like an extended sitcom by David Hyde Pierce...Brian Hargrove's book and lyrics have moments of both wit and poignancy, as well as the occasional vulgarity and a sometimes contrived set of surprises. Barbara Anselmi, who also conceived the show, provides tuneful, sprightly music which creates an air of gaiety as the carefully planned Big Day unspools into farcical chaos. Along the way, everyone must deal with the pressure of expectations, disappointments and strained family dynamics. An excellent cast transcends the sometimes predictable material...The show has a brash, non-stop pace...Even if you see many of the jokes coming a long way off, the sheer talent on display in ""It Shoulda Been You"" is worth snagging an invitation to this comically inventive wedding.",Associated Press,Jennifer Farrar,04/14/2015

That it nonetheless manages to be truly amusing is a testament to the talent both on and offstage: such comic pros as Tyne Daly, Harriet Harris and Edward Hibbert manage to make the hoariest of jokes uproarious, while director David Hyde Pierce has staged the proceedings with a brisk expertise that makes the 100 intermissionless minutes fly by. It's the sort of show that practically redefines the term ""guilty pleasure""...The score by composer Barbara Anselmi...and book writer-lyricist Brian Hargrove (Hyde Pierce's real-life husband) is utterly negligible, and the show would probably have worked just fine without it...The characters and situations are hopelessly contrived and formulaic...and the plot twist late in the show will only seem shocking to Middle Americans...But for all its obvious deficiencies, It Shoulda Been You...is the sort of shamelessly lowbrow comedy too often missing from Broadway these days, Larry David's Fish in the Dark notwithstanding.",Hollywood Reporter,Frank Scheck,04/14/2015
It Shoulda Been You,7,Broadway Review: ‘It Shoulda Been You’,"""It Shoulda Been You"" is awfully funny. That's strange, because there's nothing especially clever about this musical comedy...The characters are broadly caricatured comic types you might find at a sitcom wedding (overbearing Jewish mother, high-strung bride, alcoholic mother of the groom, flamboyantly gay wedding planner, etc.), and instead of saying ""Comedy Tonight!"" the music says ""Take a Nap!"" But with impeccable instincts for finding their laughs, Hyde Pierce and his terrific ensemble players make this hokum seem terribly funny.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,04/14/2015

Equally essential is a cast of real pros -- including Tyne Daly and Harriet Harris as the mothers-in-law -- to sell the ancient sitcom angst as if nobody had ever dreamed up such alleged hilarity before. Improbably, if the audience at a recent preview is an indication, this conscientiously good-humored 100-minute show may well be a demographic crowd-pleaser. The overqualified cast convinces us that everyone onstage is having a terrific time, which goes a long way toward muffling the incredulity that such a throwback has found its way back to Broadway.",Newsday,Linda Winer,04/14/2015

As it is, this cast is probably as close to a dream team for a wedding comedy as you can get...A big twist at roughly the halfway point sends ""Shoulda"" off in a more serious direction. It feels dated, and it certainly caught me by surprise. ""Shoulda"" has a book and lyrics by Brian Hargrove (he's Pierce's husband), and pleasant, if run-of-the-mill, music by Barbara Anselmi. Overall, this is fair-to-middling material that's elevated by a superior cast. It's a good show, but you can't help thinking it shoulda been better.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,04/14/2015

Then again, the reason for the resilience of the comedy about the wedding...is that most of us have either had one, are relishing one or are worrying that there never will be one for us. That ease of identification, coupled with strikingly lively direction from David Hyde Pierce and a veritable plethora of superb farcical performances from the likes of Tyne Daly and Harriet Harris, explains why a great deal of the content in this show -- which actually is much better than the above description implies -- lands with its audience.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/14/2015
It Shoulda Been You,7,Review: 'It Shoulda Been You' opens on Broadway,"A Jewish bride marries a Christian groom, overbearing mothers go to war, the older sister feels left out and there are countless hitches on the way to getting hitched. If you think you've heard this one, you're only partly right. The new musical ""It Shoulda Been You"" takes the wedding day setup that fuels so many romantic comedies, but offers a twist that livens up the proceedings...David Hyde Pierce directs with a sure hand for comedy, and Brian Hargrove contributes book and lyrics full of clever banter. Yet the score by Barbara Anselmi is thoroughly conventional, and, before and after the musical's surprising mid-show revelation, the characters are often overly familiar and the sentiment sticky. The interval of surprise is undeniable, and Anselmi's music is soundly constructed - but one wishes the musical felt more consistently original.",Star-Ledger,Ronni Reich,04/14/2015

And for some odd reason, each character seems have at least two songs apiece, certain overkill for a show that's only 100 minutes.

Mining an illusion of charm from such terrain is hard, if not impossible, work for any contemporary performer. Not that the eminently talented ensemble members here don't do their best to fill out the paper-doll stereotypes they have been asked to embody...For the most part, the score sticks so relentlessly to the same up-tempo jauntiness that you expect a bouncing ball to materialize...There's not an element in ""It Shoulda Been You"" that hasn't been used, and wrung dry, before.

Brian Hargrove's been-there-done-that plot (Tyne Daly's Jewish mom is a monster of tactlessness, Harriet Harris's Catholic mom a boozehound) was already a cliché a half-century ago, and today its whiskery stereotypes are a millimeter away from being actively offensive. As for Barbara Anselmi's music, it sounds like a medley of discarded theme songs from the pilots of failed '70s sitcoms. The cast, fortunately, is excellent...David Hyde Pierce's staging is sufficiently adroit to make you long to see what he'd do with a real musical.

At least it sports a terrific ensemble, led by Tyne Daly and Harriet Harris as warring mothers. These talented, hard-working actors are a joy to watch, and almost make up for the drecky writing...But there's little anyone can do with Barbara Anselmi's disposable melodies, lyrics that rhyme ""sarong"" and ""so wrong,"" ""verklempt"" and ""dreamt,"" or a hugely improbable plot twist that makes ""Tony n' Tina's Wedding"" look like a docu-drama.

Brian Hargrove's book...is cleverly constructed, laying out its wedding plot according to musical-theater best practices...it's worth pointing out that neither plot twist is very credible, and the big one, however contemporary it may be in fact, already feels stale. Still, it has been set up well enough to produce a roar of laughter, and to carry the story swiftly to its unexpectedly touching conclusion. This is in part the result of David Hyde Pierce's understated direction, with its emphasis on comic timing and full commitment to stock characters...it's a nice surprise to find that the real star of the show is Lisa Howard...Howard...has the unusual ability of making likability and warmth, so often boring onstage, theatrical.

This, thanks to a general upgrading of the cast (other than four central actors); slicker, fast-farce work from director David Hyde Pierce; and what seem to be many more jokes. Weaknesses still remain, led by the contrived story and a decidedly non-rousing score, but what was well-nigh intolerable in New Jersey is now... well, tolerable...Mr. Hyde Pierce's direction, as it turns out, helps keep the proceedings happily and dizzily airborne.",Huffington Post,Steven Suskin,04/14/2015

When the material is this disappointing, no one can save it...Under better circumstances, this might have been a fun, feel-good trifle. Unfortunately, the sitcom humor is well-worn and hokey, the music is weak, the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes and the concept is tissue-paper thin. Ironically, having great actors involved doesn't make it any better.

This is a comedy which, despite the occasional amusing twist, could have been written by someone who hasn't seen a play since the early days of Neil Simon...then there is David, an endearing, querulous beanpole, leaning back on his skinny hips and doing what fans have come to see him do, only with bigger arm gestures.

If its humor can be predictably caustic, Fish's tone is pleasingly light and flaky. Director Anna D. Shapiro keeps the pace brisk but also knows how to milk a visual...The leading man is something of a spectacle in himself. David has said that he didn't plan to play Norman when he wrote Fish, but he rises to the task by, basically, upping his shtick for the back rows. Waving his arms about and sounding increasingly shrill, David can make Norman's social awkwardness rather too convincing...Perhaps the ultimate message, to the extent that there is one, is not to take life -- or death -- too seriously.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,03/05/2015

Shapiro stages the hybrid sitcom-farce for maximum shine, and the mix of seasoned actors with David's breezy script (about three TV episodes' worth of plot windup) results in a night of huge, rolling laughs. Many of them come from David's idiosyncratic presence.

Fish in the Dark,7,Theater Review: Fish in the Dark Is a New Domain for Larry David,"It's well built, occasionally thoughtful, and consistently very funny if not transcendently so. In short: You'll laugh, you'll cry - well, you'll cry when the Visa bill comes...for a playwriting debut, if not a Broadway acting debut, Fish in the Dark is amazingly confident and delivers what it promises. But it's got neither the cerebral gloss of Clybourne Park and Stage Kiss (to name two recent laugh riots) nor the solid emotional underpinnings of much older comedies like The Odd Couple, which is, after all, about men's loneliness. It's going for something else, and almost gets there.""",Vulture,Jesse Green,03/05/2015

In David's world, everything is a setup for his characters' self-centered behavior. With the stellar cast directed by Anna D. Shapiro, the payoffs are genuinely hysterical...He generously surrounds himself with masters of comic timing; Jayne Houdyshell, Lewis J. Stadlen, Rosie Perez, Rita Wilson, MaryLouise Burke and Ben Shenkman among them.

Fish in the Dark,7,'Fish in the Dark': Theater Review,"...Larry David's first venture into Broadway playwriting, Fish in the Dark, is a spirited throwback to that once hugely popular gagmeister's patented specialty: classic boulevard comedy molded to fit the American Jewish family. It's also pure sitcom, energized by David's customary serrated edges and willfully abrasive characters...Director Anna D. Shapiro...stages the comedy with an unapologetic endorsement of its retro roots. She keeps her foot firmly on the accelerator without flooring it...While David adheres to an old-fashioned Broadway model, he also lards the comedy with enough of his trademark brittle edge to prevent it from becoming too quaint. His liking for uncomfortable situations and annoying characters, unskilled in diplomacy, yields steady laughs throughout...David has never been an actor so much as an exaggerated version of himself, and that's exactly what's called for in a performance played in knowing complicity with the audience. His exasperated eye rolls, appalled double-takes and broadly physicalized reactions of disbelief or mock atonement are all essential parts of shtick that fits him like a glove, and his public eats it up.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,03/05/2015
Fish in the Dark,7,"Larry David's ""Fish"" Leaves an Aftertaste","What plays well on the small screen occasionally generates honest laughs on stage, though ""Fish"" becomes ponderous and ultimately feels like a sitcom episode tenuously stretched over two-plus hours...The humor is vintage David, and you either find it appealing or you don't; I thought a lot of the writing was lazy or boorish...This ""Fish"" has a tendency to meander. More than once I felt as if the comedy was hitting a brick wall, only to be jarred out of my stupor by a set-up that could only come from David's sharp, Sheepshead Bay-cultivated mind. Those moments are too rare. Among the fresher things about David's comedy is the endearing performance by newcomer Jake Cannavale...The young man makes the most of his big moment in the second act, holding his own against seasoned pro Houdyshell...Hardcore Larry David fans will get a kick out of seeing the comic live on stage.

But for all the audience's indulgent laughter and the obligatory standing ovation at the end, one can't help but detect a certain, well, lack of enthusiasm...On Curb Your Enthusiasm...David proved himself a master of structure: weaving three or four storylines each week into a neat, 30-minute operetta of comic angst. With a two-act play to fill up, David has made everything bigger...Onstage, David is bigger too. His whiny voice and perplexed expressions are perfectly sized for the small screen. Here he has to project his trademark shrug to the back of the mezzanine -- hunching up his shoulders and stretching his arms so wide he looks like a seagull coming in for a landing at Kennedy Airport...for a comedy writer who practically reinvented the TV sitcom, it's surprising to see how clumsy and old-fashioned David's playwriting is.",Time,Richard Zoglin,03/05/2015

Well, that, and ""Old Jews Telling Jokes""...To say that David looks new to the dramaturgical game ain't the half of it...So, David wrote a play that you actually could do without him (people will). And both he and the play go to some very funny places. Thanks to the plot being centered on a death in the family, and the ensuing fights over a Rolex watch and even an unexpected, illegitimate kid, the show has a life-affirming, or at least a death-cheating, quality...In its best moments, it feels as if David actually has succeeded in forming a new and potentially lucrative stand up-TV-Broadway fusion.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,03/05/2015

Standing on the stage of the Cort, he sneers at his audience like a cartoon caricature of a bespectacled turtle cautiously sticking his head out of his shell only to find a smiley-faced insurance salesman; one suspects that underneath the persona, though, he is just an old teddy bear...The whole thing is in excessively poor taste, which students of the Mel Brooks school of etiquette know can make for high-grade hilarity...While the new play draws the same sort of high-octane laughter as the fabled Neil Simon comedies of yesteryear, it is closer in style to Herb Gardner's A Thousand Clowns or Murray Schisgal's Luv.

But credible, breathing, present-tense characters are nowhere to be found....Broadway regulars like Louis J. Stadlen and Mr. Shenkman read loud and clear, in contrast to screen veterans like Ms. Wilson (as Norman's wife) and Mr. David, who tend to mumble.

Her quick changes often happen onstage with a new outfit and wig.

Mirren, whose recent film credits include ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" and ""Hitchcock,"" capably handles the challenging role, constantly altering her appearance while conveying the Queen's firm respect for tradition, a sympathetic ear and a witty sense of humor.",amNY,Matt Windman,03/08/2015

How often do we ever even hear Elizabeth's voice? Through a variety of often workaday anecdotes over two-plus hours, Mirren fills in the blanks, crafting a portrait of a tough and empathetic woman who has survived thanks to personal warmth, good humor and a profound sense of duty.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,03/08/2015
The Audience,8,'The Audience': Theater Review,"Morgan's take on the Queen in these fictionalized meetings is daubed in skewed sentiment, but Mirren sells it with impeccable finesse. The playwright finds poignancy in his protagonist's indebtedness to Major for guiding her through the public's growing distance from the monarchy, as well as in her understated but evident affection for Wilson, who starts their association on the defensive but forges a relaxed camaraderie as he shares his self-doubts. McCabe and Baker take full advantage of playing the most fully drawn of the PM characters, giving relatable performances that provide an entertaining counterpoint to Mirren's poise.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,03/08/2015
The Audience,7,Theater Review: Helen Mirren Holds The Audience,"Seldom do costumes provide the bulk of a play's drama, but in Peter Morgan's The Audience, starring Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II, the greatest surprises and transformations are all in the clothes... Which is all to say that Daldry and his superb designers have worked more magic than has the playwright, if not as much as Mirren herself. In fact, it's difficult to justify calling The Audience a play at all: It is more like a pageant, not merely in the parade-of-costumes sense but in the theatrical sense.",Vulture,Jesse Green,03/08/2015

Effortlessly and consistently commanding and composed, Mirren can't be upstaged. She's the jewel in this crown. Still, her portrait never quite ascends to that elusive level of transcendence - or indelibility... Don't blame Dame Helen. The Broadway star vehicle she's driving lacks the high-octane fuel to take her there, even though it's stylishly directed by Stephen Daldry and eloquently designed by Bob Crowley.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,03/08/2015

If you've seen Mirren in ""The Queen,"" also written by Morgan, there's no reason to see ""The Audience."" Princess Diana provides the dramatic conflict that drives the movie, and her presence is sorely missed in the play, where's there's absolutely no dramatic conflict.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,03/08/2015

It makes you look like a giraffe with a goiter""), this Gigi snaps back at his every insult (""The door's over there. And don't forget your chocolates. I won't be able to swallow them because of this terrible goiter"", she quips), and then bids him adieu with all but a kick in the head. Every moment Hudgens isn't onstage, you long for her return-not only for her dramatic talents, but also because she wears Catherine Zuber's beautiful costumes so breathtakingly well.",Entertainment Weekly,isabella Biedenharn,04/08/2015

He and Hudgens are sweet together, and seem to share a genuine rapport. Hudgens may have the drawing power, but Clark is crafting a performance that will linger after the curtain falls...Clark...hits every note perfectly...Clark imbues Mamita with a sweet sadness that keeps you rooting for her...As Honore Lachaille, McGillin does a fine job of being both good-natured and rakish...""Gigi"" boasts classic orchestrations, Catherine Zuber's gorgeous costumes and appealing dance numbers.

And while her trebly voice has limited range, Hudgens is comfortable onstage and gives the character a playful assurance...she has a warm rapport with Clark and Hoty, and you want to see Gigi with them rather with puppyish Gaston and his suave uncle, Honoré (Howard McGillin).

Gigi,7,'Gigi': Theater Review,"...a lazy eye roll is about the most extreme reaction likely to be provoked by this pretty but charm-deficient revival of the Lerner and Loewe musical, which plants an all-American, too-contemporary Vanessa Hudgens in a wanly unatmospheric Belle Époque Paris...Thomas downplays the issue of Gigi being trained to continue the family tradition by becoming a high-class courtesan...However, by removing almost any doubt that Gigi's fate ultimately will rest in her own hands, Thomas dulls what's most distinctive about the story, turning it into a conventional romance between a bland couple of compatible age range, interrupted by an awkward contractual negotiation...the show soars only intermittently toward the end, notably when Cott (a mini-Hugh Jackman) sings a gorgeous version of the stirring title song, and when Hudgens finally shifts beyond one-note youthful perkiness to display some romantic feeling. Both actors are perfectly sweet and vocally very capable...But the characters never come alive with even half the passion that Clark invests in ""Say a Prayer,"" in which Mamita expresses her love and concern for her granddaughter.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/08/2015
Gigi,7,'Gigi' review: Prettied up for a new age,"Starring the talented Vanessa Hudgens of ""High School Musical"" in her confident Broadway debut, the show, efficiently directed by Eric Schaeffer, has been sanitized, flattened and sentimentalized from stylish sophistication to what feels like a cornfed love story with beautifully ornamented Belle Epoque staircases (by Derek McLane) and gorgeous period costumes (by that wizard, Catherine Zuber)...In making Gaston so close to Gigi's age, however, Heidi Thomas' adaptation robs even a frisson of inappropriate tension from the courtship. Nor does it help to have cast Corey Cott, a drab, boyish actor with a good voice but little charisma, as the playboy whose exploits are legend to all of Paris...While [Hudgens] has the flair of a stage natural and soars through her few ballet sequences in Joshua Bergasse's busy and pedestrian choreography, her voice has the steely, engaging quality of a Disney heroine singing through helium.",Newsday,Linda Winer,04/08/2015
Gigi,7,Review: Vanessa Hudgens charms as 'Gigi' on Broadway,"The musical, based on a 1944 novel by Colette, is not Lerner and Loewe's best. But it's lovingly updated in a new Broadway incarnation directed by Eric Schaeffer, with magnificent visuals of Belle Époque Paris, arresting choreography and, yes, a charming performance by leading lady Vanessa Hudgens. Hudgens...makes a commendable Broadway debut as a young woman in the throes of adolescent gawkiness, long limbs flailing as she imitates poses of womanhood...Victoria Clark is in lovely voice and emanates warmth and kindness in the role...Hudgens...deserves credit for pulling off a role that must nearly carry the show...Hudgens gives a generous, if not always naturalistic, performance as she transitions from an irrepressible tomboy to an elegant woman in love. Although her acting occasionally suffers from over-enunciation, she sings well and impressively keeps pace with the show's dancers...She has a fitting match in Cott, who has a lovely light tenor and willingness to go all-out goofy in the song ""Gigi,"" where his blinders finally come off.",Star-Ledger,Ronnie Reich,04/08/2015
Gigi,6,Vanessa Hudgens in a Squeaky Clean ‘Gigi’ on Broadway,"What the production's creators cannot do, unfortunately, is plump up the thin story or elevate the quality of the score, which doesn't rank among Lerner and Loewe's greatest...There is plenty of scrumptious eye candy to feast on...And the cast, with one unfortunate exception, makes the most of the material. Ms. Clark...brings her customary warmth to Mamita...As Gaston, Mr. Cott nicely suggests the chronic restlessness of a rich and handsome young man bored beyond his years, and he sings with bright, clear tone. Making her Broadway debut, Ms. Hudgens dashes around the stage with perky impetuousness, looking smart in her schoolgirl uniforms and, later, as chic as a runway gazelle in sleek gowns. Her characterization comes to life when Gigi pours her heart into her throat...But in between songs, Ms. Hudgens's performance flattens into two dimensions, at most. Gigi's spunkiness is there to see, but her vulnerability and ardor are mostly missing in action. The actress has energy to spare, but the performance is emotionally vacant...For the musical to inspire excitement, or even affection, we need to feel that the romantic fate of a young woman of vibrant heart and spirit hangs in the balance.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,04/08/2015
Gigi,6,Review: Vanessa Hudgens and cast do well but can't save a flat 'Gigi' revival on Broadway,"...in order to save the score, the creators of a new ""Gigi""...have done a gut renovation on the book by Colette. They've taken out the creepy factor, but they've taken out the zing, too. ""High School Musical"" star Vanessa Hudgens does pretty well in her Broadway debut, handling her singing duties admirably...She's game for a cartwheel or sprinting across the stage, but she might want to lose the strange accent since no one else is doing it. She's surrounded by good actors, too, including a head-turning performance by Corey Cott, who proves a terrific actor and singer in a frothy show, as well as the always-wonderful Victoria Clark and a gloriously catty Dee Hoty. Direction by Eric Schaeffer is crisp...and choreography by Joshua Bergasse is excellent...Derek McLane's set of sweeping, iron-lattice stairs and lots of parasols is beautiful, and Catherine Zuber's gowns and foppish suits are very becoming. All the parts are good. They just, maddeningly, don't add for a stunning show.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,04/08/2015
Gigi,6,Broadway Review: ‘Gigi’ Starring Vanessa Hudgens,"There's nothing to offend their tender sensibilities in this antiseptic version of ""Gigi""...Rather than empowering Gigi, putting more years on her makes this young adult seem dimwitted instead of innocently naive. In the same blundering way, drastically dropping the age of her jaded older suitor incongruously forces the boyish Corey Cott (""Newsies"") into the unconvincing guise of that sophisticated boulevardier Gaston Lachaille. Now that the kids are perfectly matched, there's no longer any intergenerational sexual tension between the principals. Further distorting the characters' original relationship, Hudgens (""High School Musical"") has the clarion voice and aggressive delivery of an unabashed Broadway belter, which gives Gigi vocal dominance over Gaston's delicately voiced tenor...Who hasn't lost their minds in this ill-conceived adaptation? The designers, for sure, have held their own...But if the physical look of the show suggests Paris...whenever someone opens his mouth, we're dragged back to America, where nice people don't do naughty things.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,04/08/2015
Gigi,6,Gigi,"...Eric Schaeffer's revival, starring High School Musical's Vanessa Hudgens as the titular girl, rescues the show from the dustbin of history and moves it to a recycling bin of the present. Revised by Heidi Thomas to accommodate modern sensibilities, this Gigi is inoffensive to a fault. The heroine remains a courtesan-in-training, but she's been given more spunk...Gigi is the story of a girl being groomed to sell herself, and when the musical dances around that -- however attractively, thanks to Joshua Bergasse's swift choreography -- it feels evasive. More often, though, it merely feels generic. Hudgens's Gigi seems lovely but simple, her gee-whiz appeal hobbled by affected enunciation...Only Cott, especially in his big solo, seems committed to the reality of the story. The rest is mostly yesterday's bubbly, domestic and served lukewarm.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,04/08/2015
Gigi,6,Vanessa Hudgens charms in uneven 'Gigi',"The new Broadway production ofGigi (**½ out of four), starring an adorable Vanessa Hudgens, begins with a giddy orgy of pastels...The choreography...is exhilarating, the mood buoyant. If only the fun would last. Unfortunately, in her current incarnation, the heroine...is showing signs of age, and self-consciousness...Ironically, though, Gaston's courtship of Gigi comes across as creepier here than it did when a thirtysomething Louis Jourdan pursued a dewy Leslie Caron (then Hudgens' age) onscreen...Cott's Gaston, under Eric Schaeffer's direction, rather suggests a handsome but awkward college boy who turns into a stalker upon recognizing his female friend's newfound maturity. The wistful romantic ballad that is Gigi's title song is staged as a near-nervous breakdown, with the robust-voiced Cott breathing heavily and looking alarmingly unsettled...This Gigi fares much better when it emphasizes old-fashioned virtues. Bergasse and Schaeffer provide several exuberant production numbers, and Hudgens, despite over-enunciating her lines, does perky and elegant with equal poise. Little girls, clearly, still grow up in the most delightful way.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,04/08/2015
Gigi,6,‘Gigi’ Theater Review: Vanessa Hudgens Turns a French Girl into a Very Pretty Woman,"Refashioned for the ""High School Musical"" generation, ""Gigi"" has been scrubbed and polished so that its heroine is now sassy, headstrong, and spunkier than a barrel of Disney princesses. The one thing she's not is French, and, of course, there's nothing terribly risqué or even controversial about her situation anymore. As Gigi, Vanessa Hudgens sings and moves well and looks stunning, and if ever they get around to turning ""Pretty Woman"" into a Broadway musical, she won't have to change a thing...That Gigi holds out for marriage and the greater security it provides, well, that's the real story of a modern material girl. Despite presenting such a newly ambivalent character, Clark emerges as the only actor on stage who evokes turn-of-the-century Paris...While Cott has a great singing voice, his tenor turns squealy when he shows much emotion, and at times he comes off more petulant than Gigi herself. Since it involves such a small directorial touch...couldn't Hudgens's all-American rambunctiousness been dialed back a bit?",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,04/08/2015
Gigi,6,Updated 'Gigi' still a relic of its era,"Director Eric Schaeffer...tries to distract us from the way political correctness has sanitized the story and made it soppier while lessening the stakes. The production's pacing is brisk, and the spirited choreography by Joshua Bergasse occasionally turns acrobatic. But a solution to ""Gigi"" has not been found...Hudgens, a dark-haired waif with a pretty if not particularly distinctive singing voice, makes a winning first impression...Unfortunately, the longer Hudgens is on stage, the more superficial her Gigi seems. She can deliver an image of adolescent abandon, but her emotions are dictated entirely by the plot. Her acting is all romantic pabulum -- dull sweetness, exaggerated gaiety, trumped-up anxiety leading directly to amorous ecstasy. Thomas' update doesn't give Hudgens much to work with...Making matters more vanilla, Corey Cott's young-looking Gaston seems almost as innocent as Gigi...Cott's blandness goes away when he sings, but his Gaston is yawningly on the up and up...in an attempt to bring the story up to 21st century standards, the new ""Gigi"" only seems more dated.",LA Times,Charles McNulty,04/08/2015
Gigi,5,'Gigi' theater review,"The stage version of the 1958 MGM movie musical ""Gigi"" is a good example of what the late composer Mary Rodgers called a ""why musical"" -- a tolerable but ultimately pointless adaptation that adds little to, and is inferior than, the source upon which it is based...Efforts to flesh out Gigi and her beau Gaston come off as labored...As directed by Eric Schaeffer (""Newsies""), the production has an elegant look and lively movement but nevertheless feels empty and stalled. Hudgens gives the sort of sincere but clumsy performance you'd expect to see in, well, a high school musical. But all things considered, she has been given a near-impossible task of injecting life and charm into what is essentially a two-and-a-half-hour slog.",amNY,Matt Windman,04/08/2015
Gigi,5,"First Nighter: Little Girl ""Gigi"" Does Not Grow Up on Broadway in a Most Delightful Way","...Thomas has gone about jiggling Colette's story of a young girl being trained as a courtesan and a rich family friend who grow over time into lovers. But the misguided Thomas only succeeds in denaturing Colette so that Gigi (Vanessa Hudgens), now older, and eventual swain Gaston Lachaille (Corey Cott), now younger, progress to a happy ending with any number of destructive changes to the story...The damage that politically correctness has done to the arts only worsens as time goes on...Clark shows off her clarion voice and otherwise does okay as Madame Alvarez, or Mamita...McGillin smiles well as the compering Honoré Lachaille. His duet with Clarke on ""I Remember It Well"" is the one musical highlight. Cott does passably as Gaston...Firstly, congratulations to [Hudgens] for taking on a role associated in the mind of many a Gigi fan with Audrey Hepburn and Leslie Caron. She sings perfectly well and dances nicely. She does everything competently, but as Gigi she doesn't have the essential ingredient: charm. If it comes to that, this whole Gigi is lacking in charm, if not nerve.",Huffington Post,David Finkle,04/08/2015
Gigi,5,Vanessa Hudgens in 'Gigi' on Broadway: Where are we again?,"Hudgens has to come up with a Gigi in an era when it is generally thought best that little girls are allowed to grow up in a most delightful way, far away from the prying eyes of older suitors waiting for them to bloom...Heidi Thomas...clearly is aware of these issues. She amps up Gigi's moments of rebellion from her chosen path...That would all be well and good if Hudgens had got the memo. But for most of this show she comes up with the most girlie Gigi you could possibly imagine: it is as if she were told to be as chirpy and childlike as possible, skipping around the stage and, at times, bending at the waist like a rag doll...Hudgens is, for sure, sincere and working hard. But her safe-as-the-valley Gigi feels Californian all the way and, well, not even remotely French. Actually, nothing in this show (and I include both the earnest McGillin and the setting by Derek McLane, replete with a mini Eiffel Tower) feels even remotely French. And without that je ne sais quoi, well, you're left with a piece sans any viable identity.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/08/2015
Gigi,5,Theater review: 'Gigi',"There is one performer who creates a small center of warmth and feeling, the wonderful Victoria Clark, as Gigi's loving grandmother. When she and Hoty join for a duet on ""Little Girls,"" the two theater veterans give us a glimpse of the pleasure musical theater can provide. (The song belonged in the film to Honore, but having an elderly man sing a paean to pre-adolescent females obviously no longer seemed advisable.) Clark, who has a lovely voice, also created a special moment with her solo on ""Say A Prayer."" Otherwise, ""Gigi"" is the night the Champagne went flat.",Bergen Record,Robert Feldberg,04/08/2015
Gigi,5,Theater Review: A Disney Star in a Girl-Power Gigi,"The production's desperation to appeal to tweens instead of their parents results in a disastrous if not deliberate misreading of the tale. Perhaps that wouldn't matter if the show worked on its own terms, but it did not in 1973 when Lerner brought Loewe out of retirement to expand the movie into a stage property, and it certainly doesn't now. There is still, mercifully, the score, which even if all jumbled about still contains five truly great songs and several good ones too. (Most of the newly interpolated ones are distinctly third-drawer, however.) And visually there is much to admire. Derek McLaine's Art Nouveau settings are an elegant solution to the problem of a story in which one of the stars is Paris itself; Catherine Zuber's costumes are a marvel of shapeliness, accuracy, and detail. (That's a good thing in a show that often fails to hold the attention; you can always count buttons.)

Gigi,4,'Gigi' review: Vanessa Hudgens debuts on Broadway in Lerner and Loewe revival,"The Eiffel Tower looms in the distance in ""Gigi,"" a reminder that we're in Paris. It's easy to forget that because Vanessa Hudgens plays the title role of a 1900 French could-be courtesan like an all-American Gidget. The perky but ooh-la-la-less Broadway debut by Hudgens, a sufficient singer and actress known for ""High School Musical,"" is par for the course in a shrill revival directed by Eric Schaeffer...Under Schaeffer's guidance, performances are all over the place. As the rich ""sugar prince"" Gaston, who falls for Gigi, Corey Cott makes the most of the title song. But he's boyish and saccharine when he should be debonair and sexy. Howard McGillin's take on Honore is broader than the Champs-Elysees. Tony winner Victoria Clark adds grace notes as Gigi's compassionate Mamita. Dee Hoty is saucy and steely Aunt Alicia, who instructs Gigi to accept only the most special and sparkly jewels from men...As musical gems go, ""Gigi"" is not Tiffany -- it's Jared.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,04/08/2015
Gigi,4,Gigi review – dubious age-gap musical fails to fizz,"This is a costly production and in terms of the design, that money has been very well spent. Derek McClane's set is a Belle Époque fantasia, Natasha Katz's lighting is sumptuous, and Catherine Zuber's gorgeous, sensual costuming should sew up the Tony win nicely. Joshua Bergasse's choreography is acrobatic and playful, if perhaps somewhat overblown in The Gossips and The Night They Invented Champagne.

It features a flawless cast led by the Tony winner Julie White (""The Little Dog Laughed""), whose harrowing performance handily surpasses her superb prior work in lighter comedies.

But, really, we have been down such a road far too often before...This story has less original characters and a forced peg...Director Joe Mantello wrings poignant performances from the familiar types with their formulaic tragic backgrounds...Julie White finds genuine new dark corners as the aging prostitute who wonders ""who is gonna remember us?""

There are characters you get to know and care about; an event everything points toward; a perceptible conflict leading to a crisis; and at least a quasi-resolution. On the other hand, the play bleeds well beyond those ordinary dramaturgical boundaries...The crisis, too, is unusual: It is not a central overarching one but a series of related realizations, dispersed among the characters. The unusual resolution, bringing together a fantasy sermon from the spectral Miss Ruby with an excerpt from Zoe's finished sociology paper, is, for me, the play's only overindulgence.",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/23/2015

If its characters can feel familiar, D'Amour's writing unsparingly, unabashedly gets at fundamental aspects of the human condition. There are patches of the drama that drag when everyone talks over one another.

What's theatrically indulgent about ""Airline Highway"" - and therefore, so appreciated - is how D'Amour could easily have eliminated a few actors in the ensemble, especially the people (Toni Martin, Todd D'Amour, Sekou Laidlow) who inhabit the crack den that is the lower stage-right unit at the Hummingbird Motel, rendered in seedy (almost smelly) detail in Scott Pask's harrowingly realistic set.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,04/23/2015
Airline Highway,6,Broadway Review: ‘Airline Highway’,"They really know how to throw a party in New Orleans. The rowdy bash in Lisa D'Amour's ""Airline Highway"" is a real blowout, and the disorderly partygoers seem to be having great fun. But like a lot of all-night parties, this one doesn't stand up to the light. The scribe has installed a well-observed group of misfits and losers in the Hummingbird Motel, a haven for social outcasts. But aside from throwing her makeshift family that state-of-the-art shindig, she doesn't give them much to do - or let them do anything for themselves.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,04/23/2015
Airline Highway,5,'Airline Highway': Theater Review,"In her terrific 2010 play, Detroit, Lisa D'Amour showed gimlet-eyed observation, a spiky sense of humor and a vivid feel for a place and people being left behind by the American Dream...But despite being given a dynamic production with a highly capable cast, this rambling character-driven piece lacks the earlier work's drive and clarity of purpose. While it's a vividly populated canvas, the playwright doesn't do anything much of interest with it...as soulful, alive and frequently funny as D'Amour's characters are, there's also a soggy veil of nostalgia over this gallery of beautiful losers -- hookers, strippers, bartenders, bouncers, drug addicts, dealers, poets and street philosophers. The depiction of these outsiders, with their gritty nobility and purity of heart that remain unseen beyond their community, seems simplistic almost to the point of quaintness.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/23/2015

Ms. D'Amour might just as well have called it ""The Hot L New Orleans, or, An Iceman Named Saroyan""...For all its shameless familiarity, the first act of ""Airline Highway"" is perfectly watchable, even entertaining, albeit in large part because of the superior acting of the cast, with special honors going to Mr. Freeman, Ms. Neff and Ms. White (the last of whom is incapable of giving a bad performance). Not so the second act, in which Ms. D'Amour pulls out the Tennessee Williams stop and makes her characters emit boozy soliloquies in which they vouch for their own authenticity...",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,04/23/2015

You keep waiting for playwright Lisa D'Amour to put a new spin on those archetypes .?.?. but no. There's little even the excellent Julie White can do with Tanya, the aging prostitute...There's one fabulous, unexpected scene at the end -- Miss Ruby's address to her troops.

The only part of this long, meandering byway you'll want to use is the exit ramp. Blame two companies: Manhattan Theatre Club and Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre, where the show ran earlier this year. Yes, ""Airline Highway"" is a nod to affectionate and human group portraits of everyday lives, such as Lanford Wilson's ""The Hot l Baltimore,"" but D'Amour's tale of modern-day, down-and-out New Orleans is missing a clear point and satisfying takeaway.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,04/23/2015
It's Only a Play,9,Review: 'It's Only A Play' is wickedly funny,"Some people might call ""It's Only A Play"" a valentine to the theater, but you mustn't believe them. Terrance McNally's play is not so much a love letter from a shy, smitten admirer as a mash note sent by a stalker who's written it in capital letters and smeared it with what may be bodily fluids. Whatever it is, it's a pure hoot, a rollicking comedy with perfect casting and deft direction in Jack O'Brien that gleefully dissects modern Broadway and doesn't pretend to mask its targets by using fake names...Lane is the unquestionable star here, at his droll best with perfect timing, mugging when he needs to or raising a haughty eyebrow to sell a joke the next. The rest of the cast -- including a really remarkable Broadway debut by Stock in a company of powerful stars -- is superb, all hysterical at first and then revealing deeper desires as the play continues.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,10/09/2014
It's Only a Play,9,"'It's Only a Play,' but fiercer, funnier with Lane","Some artists mellow with age. And then there's Terrence McNally...Part of what gives the new edition its sting and zing is McNally's keen awareness of how stage business has come to intersect with the broader celebrity culture, and how much more pervasive and, frankly, sillier the latter has become...As always, though, it's Lane we marvel at. Working with a playwright and a director -- Jack O'Brien, at his most delightfully mischievous -- who know the range of his comedic gifts and how to fully tap them, Lane whips the audience into fits of laughter, both jaded and joyful, from the moment James enters, promptly dialing his Hollywood agent to wax snarky about his buddy's show.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,10/09/2014

McNally doesn't just drop names -- he stomps on them, too...These put-downs comprise act one. In act two, the characters take turn reading the bad reviews. Brantley takes more jabs, but frankly, his New York Times reviews are much funnier than McNally's imitations. Many of the jokes would fail if not for Lane, Broderick and their savvy director, Jack O'Brien...Somehow the vet actors deliver and the new talent keeps coming, and it's nice to report that this revival offers not one, but two, spectacular Broadway debuts.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,10/09/2014
It's Only a Play,8,BWW Reviews: Nathan Lane Gives a Master Class in IT'S ONLY A PLAY,"Nathan Lane holds the dubious distinction of being one of Broadway's biggest stars while also being one of the stage's most underappreciated actors. Though four Tony Award nominations and two wins is rather nice, it's astonishing to think that someone so highly regarded as one of the few remaining stage stars nationally known primarily for acting in the theatre has gone sixteen times without a nomination. Whether or not number nineteen garners him the honor remains to be seen, but in the first ten minutes or so of Terrance McNally's wickedly funny offstage farce, It's Only A Play, Lane demonstrates why he is undoubtedly one of the greatest stage actors of his generation.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,10/09/2014
It's Only a Play,8,Broadway Review: ‘It’s Only a Play’,"Nobody does mean-nasty-vicious like Terrence McNally, bless his black heart. The pitiless playwright has exhumed ""It's Only a Play,"" his 1986 love-hate letter to those big babies who work and play on Broadway, and updated it for today -- and for the timely if schmaltzy reunion of Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. The comedy's slight plot, about the high drama (and low comedy) of the opening night of a new Broadway show, is still a trifle.

It's Only a Play,8,'It's Only a Play': Theater Review,"The in-jokes come thick and fast in this extensively retooled revival...it's in Lane's dynamite early scenes with gifted newcomer Micah Stock that this funny if flimsy comedy really fires on all cylinders, while Broderick underwhelms in a key role. McNally's farcical doodle starts out like gangbusters but becomes increasingly uneven. It has an annoying habit of stalling when it should accelerate, particularly in a padded second act that could use an editor...What keeps it entertaining even when the writing falters is McNally's equal-opportunity ribbing of everyone involved -- playwrights, producers, actors, directors, theater landlords, stagehands, etc. That favorite punching bag, the critic, takes a beating...But ultimately, this starts to feel less like the tight collaboration of a writer and director intent on keeping the comedy machinery humming than the product of an overcrowded writers' room full of gagmeisters trying to outdo one another...It's Only a Play begs to be done as a brisk one-act...Either way, while the vehicle is not exactly robust, McNally and O'Brien know the terrain well enough to ensure that it sparkles more often than it sags.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,10/09/2014
It's Only a Play,8,'It's Only a Play' review: Smart and funny from Terrence McNally,"If the entire dream cast of Terrence McNally's backstage revenge play had less than split-millisecond timing, the merciless inside-showbiz observations about the theater and theaterfolk might wound deeper than they amuse. Instead, McNally's major update and overhaul of his 1985 work is likely to remind the gleefully unrepentant among us of Alice Roosevelt Longworth's quote that, more or less, said, ""If you can't say anything good about someone, sit right here by me....Lane revels in the ego and insecurity of the actor with the TV series who turned down a part written for him by his playwright-buddy, underplayed with deft earnestness and panic by Broderick, the comedy's straight man. Channing is delicious as an aging star with drug issues and a parolee's ankle bracelet. Mullally has a dumb-smart way with malaprops as the eager fledgling producer. Grint -- all spiked red hair and raccoon eyes -- is perfectly bratty as the British directing genius, while Abraham skulks creepily around as a vicious critic with an agenda...As long as they're not up there laughing at you, however, this is the rare Broadway comedy that's as smart as it is funny.",Newsday,Linda Winer,10/09/2014
It's Only a Play,8,It's Only a Play,"Andnow it's landed on Broadway at last in a hilarious and star-packed evening of theater in-jokes that often plays like a nonmusical version of Forbidden Broadway...Director Jack O'Brien's production reteams Tony winners Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, who these days pack a bigger punch at the box office than in terms of natural onstage chemistry. The two play old friends...But while Lane commands the stage with his quippy narcissism (abetted by some of McNally's strongest meta-jokes), Broderick continues his recent run of stiff, somnambulent, and overly mannered stage performances. The energy and pace of the show deflate whenever he opens his mouth...The rest of the cast, though, enlivens characters who can border on the thanklessly one-dimensional...Despite McNally's considerable revisions, there's just not enough plot here to sustain a two-and-a-half-hour show -- and what plot there is can seem thinner and more obvious than Abraham's toupee...It's Only a Play is a poison-pen mash note to New York theater, at once gleefully bitchy and affectionate.

O.K., so maybe he does. But I still find it hard to take the references too personally. For one thing, the self-important, vitriolic Mr. Brantley is treated no more harshly than the self-important, vitriolic characters onstage...Such improper proper-noun-slinging probably goes down better now than it did three decades ago...[Lane's] portrayal here of James Wicker...is sterling. He and Ms. Channing -- who is hilarious as a washed-up, substance-and-plastic-surgery-abusing Hollywood star -- give the show a sheen and a heart it might otherwise lack...Mr. McNally's play is a bit more old-fashioned, perhaps, but then so is the theater, God bless it.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,10/09/2014

As directed by Jack O'Brien, it is also a depressingly uneven production. The first scene, which takes place between the immaculate Lane, who is superb, and the one no-name in the cast, Micah Stock -- having a career-making moment playing a newbie to Broadway and thus the guy serving the drinks -- sparkles with pleasures...But then Grint...enters...And then the otherworldly Broderick shows up...and, well, the air goes out of the whole affair because Grint is about six sizes too large and Broderick's performance is, with a few funny exceptions, just too creepy to be funny.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,10/09/2014

While Barrett's singing voice is undeniably beautiful, she seems to believe every line out of a Russian love story deserves overwrought delivery...Two-time Tony-winning director Des McAnuff...doesn't do the show any favors with dull staging, overuse of projections...and far too many deafeningly-loud explosives through battle scenes...While we're on the subject of auditory unfortunateness, Lucy Simon's score and Michael Korie and Amy Powers' lyrics are haunting at their finest (and admittedly, rarest) moments and just plain boring at their worst.",Entertainment Weekly,Jessica Shaw,04/21/2015
Doctor Zhivago,5,First Nighter: 'Doctor Zhivago' Caught at Musical Malpractice,"..two hours and 40 minutes of tireless earnestness...The industriousness expended by all those creators has been, it's a true pity to relate, in the service of a Wikipedia go at Pasternak's brilliant, if occasionally turgid, take on the physician-poet Yuri Zhivago...Yes, it's a couple mouthfuls of love story...Battles rage, conflagrations torture the sky, explosions split the air, rifles spit...Mutu...has a rich baritone he puts to good use. Barrett...has a clear soprano she also employs well. Actually, the singing by everyone--certainly by Gayer, Nolan and Hewitt--is at a praise-worthy level. The catch is that as persuasive as they sound, they'd fare better were they given persuasive songs to sing. Instead, Simon's melodies are unrelentingly derivative. More than anything, they give the impression of being one extremely long song written for Les Miserables...Perhaps worse even than the music are the Michael Korie-Amy Powers lyrics.",Huffington Post,David Finkle,04/21/2015
Doctor Zhivago,5,'Doctor Zhivago': Russian love is frozen over on Broadway,"Rare indeed are the musicals that begin, in essence, with three consecutive memorial services...but it is emblematic of the problems that beset this new Broadway musical...that love story is lost in a melange of flame, ice, death and frantic characters rushing around a heavily raked stage without ever seeming really to know where they are going...Nolan has an extraordinary singing voice, and Mutu certainly is no slouch in the vocal department, but he's a tad stiff and unyielding. There is a certain poignancy and truth in McAnuff's staging of a marriage rooted in warm affection but not the life force of sexual passion. And a few of Simon's songs are quite beautiful, although they all seem squelched by the conceptual whole, unable to break free. ""Doctor Zhivago"" is one of those shows that needed to cut through the icy clutter and find the optimism of love and the sacrifices it spawns. Alas, the poetic leanings of the title character are never fully explored.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/21/2015
Doctor Zhivago,5,Boris Pasternak Would Not Be Proud of ‘Doctor Zhivago’,"Oh, the agony of it all. Wolves howl. Snow falls. Grenades explode. Guns blare. Vodka flows. Bodies fall. Marching boots stomp. Depressed and dying lovers search the Russian steppes for each other in vain, mournfully moaning lyrics that make no sense. Cue the violins, sawing away on atonal melodies nobody can remember. And somewhere, between one world war, one revolution, one civil war, one Red Army, one White Army, the fall of the Germans and the arrival of the Communists, an ambitious saga of tedium unfolds on the stage of the Broadway Theatre called Doctor Zhivago. You can hardly hear it for the snoring...The musical, clumsily directed by Des McAnuff...also sprawls, in all the wrong directions. Zhivago, imported from London, is somebody called Tam Mutu, who sports a strong voice like a bus-and-truck Alfred Drake, and with zero charisma...He leaves the details of stealing the show to Paul Alexander Nolan, who plays a villain with a handsome, lethal bravado that makes you understand why Lara fell for him in the first place.",Observer,Rex Reed,04/21/2015
Doctor Zhivago,4,Review: Broadway’s ‘Doctor Zhivago’ is bombastically silly,"Visually beautiful but one-dimensional, the show...is breathless and bombastic to the point of silly, undercutting not only the novel by Boris Pasternak but also some really wonderful actors in Tam Mutu and Kelli Barrett, and what could have been a memorable score by Lucy Simon...Nearby, in another theater, ""Les Miserables,"" another flag-waving tale of revolution, looks absolutely subtle in comparison...here the epic nature seems just an excuse for adding flashy elements...Book writer Michael Weller thinks the audience need to be spoon-fed history in huge chunks, and so has used a shovel...Mutu and Barrett bravely give it their all and are utterly perfect as the star-crossed lovers. He is actually understated in a show that is anything but, and captures the inner turmoil of a forbidden love. Barrett's soprano is gorgeous and she is a worthy Lara, bewitching as a woman both tortured and strong...But pulling anyone back from the brink is not something McAnuff does naturally.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,04/21/2015
Doctor Zhivago,4,Doctor Zhivago,"Zhivago, based on Boris Pasternak's 1957 doorstop (which also inspired the great David Lean film) is a dauntingly interior novel to distill into a musical. Its stakes are more nuanced than in Hugo's moral fable, and there's not much drama watching our hero (Tam Mutu) sit down to write a poem after finally sleeping with longtime obsession Lara (Kelli Barrett)...No amount of Lucy Simon's syrupy, portentous music -- swamping Michael Korie and Amy Powers's workmanlike lyrics -- can make us care for the synthetic, drably colored pageant. Des McAnuff's staging looks expensive but ugly, with cheesy video close-ups of actors, giant Soviet propaganda posters, eruptions of fire and the occasional explosion or gunshot to wake us up. To Siberia with it.",Time Out NY,David Cote,04/21/2015
Doctor Zhivago,4,‘Doctor Zhivago’ review: Musical based on Boris Pasternak novel of love and war on Broadway,"Broadway's ""Doctor Zhivago"" is an epic miss...this miscalibrated musical is yet another attempt to bottle page-to-stage lightning a la ""Les Miserables."" But electricity doesn't zap...The score by composer Lucy Simon and lyricists Michael Korie and Amy Powers resonates with occasional Russian-inflected melodies and lots of ardent power ballads. Respectable, but unremarkable, songs hang like wallpaper...Des McAnuff's direction is another issue...he fails to convey what matters most -- intimacy...We do understand that they're separated by revolution...We don't get enough of what's fueling their passion. Or why his writing is so important...As Yuri, London stage star Tam Mutu sings with a manly ardor and has a cleft chin deep as the Volga River. As the staunch Lara, Kelli Barrett's vocals are bright and clear. They're likable together but no fire. Without the inferno, the ""Doctor"" remains in guarded condition.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,04/21/2015
Doctor Zhivago,4,‘Doctor Zhivago’ Theater Review: Broadway Musical Targets Old Russia’s Top 1 Percent,"It's got more marches than ""The Music Man,"" more battle scenes than ""La Forza del Destino,"" and it must set a record for the number of gun shots and bomb detonations in a Broadway musical. If all that noise doesn't inspire an immediate visit to the ear doctor, there's the score by Michael Korie, Amy Powers and Lucy Simon that's guaranteed to require it...although Kelli Barrett's chipper Laura offers a few moments of unintended levity. The ponderness of the material and Des McAnuff's direction make the two hours and 45 minutes fly by with the speed of a Soviet Union train. Nothing wears out its welcome faster than bombast. On the plus side, there's something truly noble about Mutu, a fine singing actor who somehow manages to deliver real conviction in the face of such a score, book and leading lady.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,04/21/2015
Doctor Zhivago,4,Doctor Zhivago review – a mega-musical sprinkled with inadvertent comedy,"Doctor Zhivago...gallops across the first several decades of the 20th century. But the period it most resembles is the 1980s, with the spectacle-driven mega-musicals it birthed. Not that Doctor Zhivago, slickly directed by Des McAnuff, is especially mega...The music is big and the cast is big and the emotions are definitely outsized...And yet the impact is oddly minimal. Maybe it's the undistinguished book or Lara's ridiculous wig or those silly icicles, but Doctor Zhivago seems a lot more overblown than overpowering. The style is pure melodrama, but most of the actors don't have the stanchness or the lines to pull it off...Which is a shame, as many of the songs are skillful...many of them communicate tone and character eloquently...Kelli Barrett has a lovely voice, but can't sell Lara as the cynosure of every man's desire...And if Tam Mutu doesn't seem the poetry-writing type, he has a pleasantly romantic baritone and very handsome looks.",Guardian,Alexis Soloski,04/21/2015
Doctor Zhivago,4,‘Doctor Zhivago’ Review: The Doctor Is Out,"At least one of the musicals that I see on Broadway each season leaves me shaking my head and muttering ""What were they thinking?"" on the way out of the theater. ""Doctor Zhivago,"" which purports to be adapted from Boris Pasternak's 1957 novel of Russian life before and after the October Revolution but in fact appears to be based on David Lean's 1965 film version of the book, is the worst kind of case in point. No doubt the creators thought it more respectable to claim direct descent from the book, but when you bill such a show as ""one of the most romantic stories of all time,"" you're probably not much concerned with suggesting the tone and texture of a serious novel, least of all one that no less a critical heavyweight than Edmund Wilson declared to be ""one of the great events in man's literary and moral history.""

Doctor Zhivago,2,Theater Review: Doctor Zhivago Needs Intensive Care,"Can we please get this straight, Broadway? Sprawling European novels do not make great musicals...Unfortunately, this lesson...has fallen on deaf ears at the Broadway Theatre -- and I don't just mean those forced to endure the overamplified mess that is Doctor Zhivago. I also mean its authors and director, who together have turned Boris Pasternak's 700-page novel into a musical so aggressively awful it is almost sadistic...It's not just the constant noise and gore he hurls about...It's also that he has called forth the same concussive aesthetic from Weller and even the songwriters. Lucy Simon...once again provides well-crafted Romantic Lite tunes, but they are too often whipped into bombast by relentless overproduction...The English actor Tam Mutu...is clearly expert at the romantic bellow; he makes what can only be called an impressive Broadway debut as Zhivago. He pretty much blows everyone else away...The rest of the cast seem like afterthoughts, bits of fluff and color mainly useful for moving around the stage.",Vulture,Jeremy Gerard,04/21/2015
Living on Love,8,Review: Renee Fleming delightful in madcap ‘Living on Love’,"The four time Grammy Award winner [Fleming] is a delight...able to lovingly goof on her refined world with an insider's grin...DiPietro...has a knack for writing for daffy characters and this play has a half-dozen of them. It feels comforting, like an old black-and-white film, and yet there's a newness here, too...the play centers on an aging soprano, played by a bejeweled Fleming, and her lothario Italian conductor husband...A fantastic Douglas Sills plays him like an impish boy beneath an exterior of shocking slicked-back arrogance and heavily accented English...One of the play's joys is the performances of two stuffy servants...who sing along to arias as they elegantly change the props between scenes or answer bells perfectly in sync...The play is directed with comedic aplomb by three-time Tony Award winner Kathleen Marshall...The material could be accelerated and made into a farce, but Marshall never lets the comedic elements upstage the slightly looney characters themselves.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,04/20/2015
Living on Love,8,Renée Fleming and Douglas Sills play vain divas in guilty pleasure ‘Living on Love’,"The new Broadway comedy ""Living on Love"" isn't just filled with clichés -- it revels in them. This is a show that has its cake, eats it, and then rubs whipped cream all over its face...That Raquel is played by Renée Fleming -- an actual opera star, making her Broadway debut == adds a yummy twist...It's all shamelessly silly, and it works: In Joe DiPietro's play, based on Garson Kanin's 1985 ""Peccadillo,"" broad jokes and shameless hamming make for a guilty pleasure...Wisely, DiPietro and director Kathleen Marshall let their stars play to their strengths. Fleming lets out a few trills and, though a bit stiff at times, seems to relish the high jinks. And Sills...is hilarious as the pompous, vain Vito. The show's only misstep is an 11th-hour plot twist that's as contrived as it is sentimental. Leave that at the opera, please -- we're here for dessert.",NY Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,04/20/2015
Living on Love,8,‘Living on Love’ Theater Review: Picking Up Opera Where the Marx Brothers Left It Off,"As expected, Fleming sounds great when she sings. She's also very funny when she speaks, which is not to be expected after her awkward performance earlier this year at the Metropolitan Opera in ""The Merry Widow,"" under the direction of Broadway's Susan Stroman. Musical-comedy veteran Kathleen Marshall directs ""Living on Love,"" and you'd never know it's her Broadway debut, too, as the director of a play. No small part of Fleming's success must go to Marshall...With all due respect to the diva of the hour, the real revelation of ""Living on Love"" is Sills, whose divo Vito enters the Broadway pantheon of great, inspired, and completely over the-top comic creations.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,04/20/2015
Living on Love,8,'Living on Love' with Renee Fleming opens on Broadway,"""Living With Love"" flies by, with nearly as many jokes as there are sparkles on a ""La Bohème"" costume Raquel sports...It's not exactly full of surprises, but the light comedic throwback is well executed by the cast and creative team. DiPietro's script takes a kernel of an idea from Garson Kanin's 1985 ""Peccadillo"" and spins it into something completely different and quite entertaining. Director Kathleen Marshall has a knack for the piece's scale and the quick rhythms of its banter. As Vito De Angelis, Douglas Sills gives a skillful, rangy performance. He's highly entertaining as he lashes out at Robert, primps for Iris or lounges amiably and with the playfulness of someone who knows just how to lead a scherzo...The role is written in such a way that it could be foolproof for Fleming - Raquel is always playing the diva, ready with a song, her speech even taking on a half-sung quality as though it were recitative...But she's a joy to watch when she gets to stick it to diva stereotypes. There's a wonderful self-mocking quality when she walks center stage and talks through the process of one of her famous scenes, telling her costar, ""no one is looking at you, you're the tenor.""",Star-Ledger,Ronni Reich,04/20/2015
Living on Love,7,Review: Renée Fleming Plays Against Type in ‘Living on Love’,"Renée Fleming seems like far too nice a woman to be playing a diva...Even screeching and preening like a peacock in mating season, Ms. Fleming glows with good nature, good sportsmanship and the reassuring sanity of a hostess at a fancy dress party who knows that all these silly high jinks shall pass. If such amiability makes Raquel less a monster than the script dictates, it also makes the show less a chore to sit through...DiPietro's version seems more like a forgotten bottom-drawer comedy from the 1930s...in fairness, everybody in ""Living on Love"" appears to be having a fairly good time...Though most of the jokes are so tired you expect them to nod off by themselves, the cast delivers them with go-for-broke gusto...It's only when [Fleming] sings...that Raquel becomes the passionate, larger-than-life figure she is said to be. The glimpse of real grandeur in that voice makes this trifle of a play seem even smaller. ... Raquel (Fleming) and her husband (Mr. Sills) belong to the breed of outsize, badly behaved theatrical couples who have been showing up at least since the salad days of George S.

But O'Connell isn't playing in the same league, and his discomfort repeatedly throws off the comic rhythms...It's all very charming until the ill-advised saccharine payoff which has half the audience cheering and the other half wondering how long we have to put up with yet more shameless pandering to the social zeitgeist.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,04/20/2015
Living on Love,7,'Living on Love': Theater Review,"...there's nothing contemporary and too little that's consistently funny about playwright Joe DiPietro's refried serving of Peccadillo...the new version does have a thoroughbred casting coup in its favor, which is the sporting turn of celebrated lyric soprano Renée Fleming as fading opera diva Raquel De Angelis. But when Raquel is not onstage trilling with vainglorious self-adulation and encroaching terror of her professional decline, the fizz quickly evaporates...while DiPietro and director Kathleen Marshall...treat the material like farce, it lacks accelerating mayhem...Anyone who has seen Chlumsky's fine work on Veep knows how skillfully she can underplay comedy. But her role here is written with too little dimension or consistency...And there's minimal chemistry between the actress and O'Connell, who is hopelessly miscast...O'Connell has a way of sucking the comic energy out of the room...Sills is a wily old pro who sails through the proceedings with brio in a one-note role...[Fleming's] performance is broad and campy, as the material dictates, but there's also a delightful airiness to it.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/20/2015
Living on Love,7,'Living on Love' review: Renée Fleming makes solid debut in opera comedy,"There is something almost daring about Broadway's inexplicable insistence on throwback fluff-ball comedies this spring. Daring, perversely, but not encouraging. Into the 1950s time warp comes ""Living on Love,"" another example of a well-crafted triviality without subtext or a thought in its head beyond trying too hard to entertain. Joe DiPietro's play...will be remembered, if at all, as the vehicle for Renée Fleming's altogether honorable Broadway debut...Douglas Sills expertly throws himself into the histrionics as the ridiculous libidinous maestro with the atsa-spicy-meatball Italian accent and an insane head of hair...Fleming, who dots her performance with lustrous fragments from opera's greatest hits, doesn't speak as effortlessly as she sings. But she knows about comic timing and stage presence, self-mocking all the grand-opera caricatures...Not surprisingly, the production...has the broad, exaggerated physicality of a comic musical -- albeit, perhaps, one most comfortable as larky summer theater.",Newsday,Linda Winer,04/20/2015
Living on Love,7,"Renée Fleming Hits a High Note with ""Living on Love""","A little knowledge of opera helps, but it's not key to admiring the frothy and fizzy ""Living on Love,"" in which soprano Renée Fleming makes her Broadway debut -- you're apt to enjoy the celebrated diva in this send-up of celebrated divas, even if the in-jokes about Maria Callas pass you by...Fleming, with her silk caftans and gorgeous arias (she has ample opportunity to break into song, and it gave me goosebumps each time) throws herself into all the diva cliches as she tries to outdo her philandering husband...Sills...is a comic marvel as the out-of-tune conductor who thinks he still has a way with the ladies...Most of the time, Fleming is boozy and Sills is flamboyant. It's not until the end of the two-act confection (you won't be blamed for wishing director Kathleen Marshall had made things just a bit tighter), that they have to do anything bittersweet. When Vito and Raquel finally drop their schtick and connect with each other, it makes for an impressive conclusion, especially considering the abrupt change in tone.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,04/20/2015
Living on Love,7,Theater Review: 'Living On Love',"The play certainly looks good. The De Angelis apartment, designed by Derek McLane, is properly luxurious. And Michael Krass' costumes are perfect: dazzling, 1950s-inspired outfits for Raquel and blindingly bright pajamas with matching robes for Vito. For Fleming, the fine work she does in ""Living on Love"" could lead to a second career as a stage actress. That would make any descent into mezzo territory totally irrelevant.",Bergen Record,Robert Feldberg,04/20/2015
Living on Love,6,Fleming is high note of thin 'Living',"How do you deliver a pitch-perfect performance when the writer keeps giving you flat notes? This is the conundrum faced by the cast of Living On Love (**½ out of four), the flimsy new comedy that marks the Broadway debut of opera star Renée Fleming...Playwright Joe DiPietro...provides a few sharper lines, but not enough to sustain nearly two hours of dialogue. Still, director Kathleen Marshall...keeps the pace brisk, and her actors are infectiously game. Fleming, in particular, plays her part with obvious relish, and reveals a real flair for screwball repartee. The soprano uses her earthy speaking voice to great effect -- lowering it when Raquel is trying to reprimand or seduce, then offering higher, brighter tones to affect delight or indignation. On occasion, Raquel will regale us with a brief excerpt from a classic aria, allowing Fleming to show off her enduring prowess.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,04/20/2015

Kaufman and Moss Hart were it not for one minor problem: It isn't funny. Not even slightly so. Indeed, it's so unfunny as to make the viewer despair of ever laughing again, much as a starving man might despair of ever eating again...Ms. Marshall has directed ""Living on Love"" as if it were a musical with an onionskin-thin book, nudging her cast toward clattery caricature...While it's quite possible that Ms. Fleming can act, she definitely can't act like a temperamental diva, perhaps because she's known throughout the world of opera for her niceness.

Living on Love,6,Theater Review: A Domesticated Renée Fleming in Living on Love,"Living on Love, as directed by Kathleen Marshall, is tacky and weirdly downmarket, as if divas and maestros could only be made palatable to contemporary audiences by turning them into frenetic buffoons...And while Sills has the craft and comic experience to scale up his performance to Broadway levels, I'm sorry to say he's the only one of the four leads who can convincingly project this weak material to the back of the house...It is certainly very strange to report that Fleming, one of the great operatic sopranos of the last three decades, cannot. She is lovely, she is game, and you always sense her niceness. But these qualities domesticate Raquel's monstrousness; she isn't fierce enough to make her middling antics funny...What's oddest is that, without music, Fleming can't seem to find a natural shape for her lines...This distinction becomes clear when, after teasing us with snippets of arias throughout the play, Fleming finally lets loose with a whole song: ""Always.""

Living on Love,5,'Living on Love' theater review,"Fleming and Sills serve up over-the-top caricatures, while O'Connell and Chlumsky dutifully serve as their pawns and playthings. Fleming occasionally breaks into bits of familiar arias, adding some operatic flavor...The most inspired bit of comedy involves an encore curtain call that mocks the self-indulgent, overextended ones you can still see during revivals of Franco Zeffirelli productions at the Met. Directed with Technicolor flair by Kathleen Marshall...""Living on Love"" might have been enjoyable were it not for the complete emptiness of the piece itself.

Heidi is speaking at a gathering of her high school alumnae, but instead of the usual manicured, upbeat speech, she delivers an off-the-cuff, emotionally exposed anecdote. It's really a play in itself, about the sense of alienation she felt that day from other women in a gym locker room: women she respects and admires, in some senses, but whose choices to pursue life's more superficial rewards leave her feeling ""stranded."" Ms. Moss, her eyes moistening even as her voice remains strong, delivers this beautiful speech with a grace that grows stronger as Heidi's peppery, self-aware humor gives way to lacerating honesty.

I can't think either was for the dramaturgy; even when Heidi relents, describing her emotional dependence on unavailable men, she somehow remains aloof and maddeningly resistant to change. Meanwhile, everyone else, whom we drop in on less frequently, seems to change like crazy, in scenes (I almost said sketches) written so broadly they now seem dated. At least two of them - the rap-group meeting as well as an inane panel discussion in 1982 - have the stock setups and bright satirical tone of early Saturday Night Live, only instead of Gilda Radner we have Tracee Chimo.",Vulture,Jesse Green,03/19/2015

The Heidi Chronicles,7,Elisabeth Moss a good fit for 'Heidi Chronicles' on Broadway,"...it was a savvy idea to cast Moss as Heidi in director Pam MacKinnon's mostly faithful, mostly pleasurable, sometimes frustrating revival of a play...Moss' performance focuses on Heidi's reticence, her inclination to stand back and observe, her disdain for conflict. All are part of Heidi, but this sometimes comes at the expense of the requisite backbone of steel that Joan Allen brought to the role when I first saw this show on Broadway in 1989 (it ran for more than 600 performances). In some ways, MacKinnon's production, aided by the charm of the actor, makes Scoop overly sympathetic and too much in control, when we need to see more of Heidi constantly matching his intelligence and his vivacity while exceeding his morality. On the other hand, Pinkham's Peter is a tad too much in the other direction, too detached, a bit unfeeling.

So why has Pam MacKinnon directed most of the supporting players around Moss as if they're on a 1980's sitcom? This approach might have worked on Broadway years ago, but in 2015 cable TV turns out far edgier fare on a weekly basis than the theater, on or off Broadway...Moss succeeds in making Heidi's dilemma vivid and crucial, even though here's an art history major who gets tons of grants, can pick between teaching at Columbia or Carleton College, and is offered a TV gig that she never pitched and rejects because it's too insignificant in light of her research on female artists of the 18th Century...Wasserstein must have known she'd turned her heroine into a whiner...",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,03/19/2015

So it's a testament to theMad Men star's appeal that she's ultimately so affecting in the role - even if the emotional rush is a long time coming.

Its landmark status is intact, but its impact has been blunted by the years: Such topics are now everywhere on stage, film, TV and even in Patricia Arquette's Oscar acceptance speech...Pam MacKinnon's direction is heavy-handed and lacks nuance...Worse, the characters are one-dimensional, so often we feel as if we're not watching people, but caricatures...Moss gives a capable if starchy performance.

Brown was the perfect choice for the job, one of the vanishingly small breed of post-Sondheim theater composers who are more than just post-Sondheims. Like the master, he's a musical dramatist, but his song models are poppier and here sound great in arrangements and orchestrations (by several hands, including his own) that recall both mid-century MGM and Nelson Riddle's Capitol years. But the gift of superb pastiche cuts two ways, and the reason Brown has not had a financial hit in all of his worthy Broadway at-bats (Parade, 13, The Bridges of Madison County) may be related to the reason his score for Vegas can't completely rescue the icky raw material.

If/Then,9,'If/Then' review: Idina Menzel back on Broadway in fork-in-the-road musical,"We are meant to feel a bit off-balance, a little disoriented, maybe even confused in parts of ""If/Then"" -- and that's the sharp point. In this intelligent, surprising, altogether original new musical, the main character is a 39-year-old divorced woman, Elizabeth, who returns to New York after 12 years as a wife in Phoenix. This is a fork-in-the-road show, a back-to-the-future entertainment in which we briefly see the consequences of different roads taken...Greif's gleaming, inventive production has lots of moving parts, including double-decker sets by Mark Wendland that add more levels with a mirror that adds layers of ceiling and sky. Disorienting? Indeed, but in attractive, unpredictable ways.",Newsday,Linda Winer,03/30/2014
If/Then,8,"Sleeker, smarter, more exhilarating ‘If/Then’ musical hits Broadway","The new ""If/Then"" is sleeker, smarter and runs far more efficiently than last year's ungainlier model, the one that had its test-drive in Washington last fall. Its heart is bigger now, too, a design modification that assures a more exhilarating ride. But it's also true that the ""If/Then"" that celebrated its official Broadway opening Sunday night at the Richard Rodgers Theatre had a number of flaws to address, and not all of them were eradicated in the months that this vehicle, by the Pulitzer Prize-winning ""Next to Normal"" team of Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, was in the shop. The biggest issue was and is the show's narrative device, telling the story of a woman whose life goes in two directions, one focused on family, the other on career. It remains something of a conundrum, for the conceit comes across, even now, less as a scintillating invention than as an encumbrance...The bottom line: ""If/Then"" is an enjoyable, beautifully sung, at times deeply touching experience, built on a structure that never completely works.",Washington Post,Peter Marks,03/30/2014
If/Then,8,'If/Then' takes an exciting leap between two lives,"Beautifully and accessibly scored, ""If/Then"" tracks its central character, an urban planner by trade, through two different sets of life choices. One involves kids and a traditional guy. The other features a bigger career but less cultivated, and thus more complex, romantic entanglements with the indecisive and conflicted (the choice between saving the world and liking Whole Foods being another dichotomy that confounds the Coldplay generation and thus infuses this show)...""If/Then"" is, for sure, overstuffed with huge crises in both storylines, and since we're double-timing here, they cascade at times in Yorkey's book with dizzying, credibility-sapping rapidity. The expositional needs are intense, but once it's clear that we're tracking Elizabeth's happiness, or lack thereof, and once Kitt and Yorkey provide her with a blistering number about bad choices that she can sing in her bathroom, the audience is in Menzel's and the show's pocket.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,03/30/2014

And despite nagging issues with its overall concept and divided story lines, it is a smart, romantic piece with a well-crafted soft rock score and great performances all around...Stylishly directed by Michael Greif on a sleek set containing a massive tilting mirror, ""If/Then"" may not be a triumph but it is contemplative, heartfelt and fashionable in a sanitized sort of way.

If/Then,7,Stuck at the Crossroads Between Fate and Choice,"""If/Then,"" you see, is a portrait of alternative existences, of roads taken or not, of the person a person might have been if she had only done this instead of that. If that sounds confusing, don't worry. You may occasionally have trouble keeping the show's twin story lines separate. But you'll never be in any doubt whatsoever as to what the central theme is. That's because Mr. Kitt (music) and Mr. Yorkey (book and lyrics) never let us forget. Until the show's last quarter, when some shadows darken the bright emotional landscape, all the songs are pretty much interchangeable. Whether performed as solos or ensemble pieces, these numbers tend to percolate along, blithely and wonderingly, at the speed of circular thought. They also put to work every metaphor you've heard about the elements of fate, chance and choice that govern our lives...Taken separately, neither plot of ""If/Then"" is terribly compelling or distinctively drawn. Taken together, they feel less like variations on a theme than dogged reiterations of a theme.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,03/30/2014

If/Then,7,STAGE REVIEW 'If/Then',"The show's exploration of fate and chance seldom rises above Hallmark-card sentimentality - and the characters have no more depth...But as even John Travolta must know by now, the real star here is Menzel, and she delivers a powerful bipolar performance that often masks the shallowness of the material. In her triumphant final ballad, 'Always Starting Over,' she proves she doesn't need to defy gravity to win over fans. With her feet planted on terra firma, she can shake the rafters and pierce your heart all at once.",Entertainment Weekly,Thom Geier,03/30/2014

If/Then,6,Review: Menzel shines but 'If/Then' too sloppy,"The tonal difference between the two acts is striking. A whimsical comedy in the first is taken over by a series of tragedies and sadness. One of the best crafted scenes and songs - ""The Moment Explodes"" - will brings gasps, and not just because it's a bit too manipulative. It's set on a plane in trouble. Sometimes, real tragedies intrude on Broadway...Credit goes for attempting to explore parallel lives onstage and the acting is great. But a show with so much potential is marred by poor editing. So, the overall answer is, if you really, really need to see and hear Menzel, then go and watch an actress wonderfully giving it her all. But if you're of two minds, then go see ""Frozen"" and just listen to her voice.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,03/30/2014

It's a smart, contemporary piece for adults. It doesn't condescend-to its sympathetic and fallible same-sex couples, or to an Army reservist (James Snyder) for whom Liz falls...Menzel imbues her character with maximum pluck and vulnerabilty. But for all the charisma of the lead and ensemble, Kitt's score blurs into similar-sounding midtempo pop ballads. Menzel carries the show but can't force us to care about Liz/Beth's average life choices. People are just too darn nice in If/Then's world. We need more bitchery and satire, more injustice for our hero to fight against, to inspire an anthem as thrilling (if as slick) as ""Let It Go.""

Constellations,10,Constellations review – Gyllenhaal and Wilson see stars in each other's eyes,"As much as it's about theoretical physics, it's also about the progress of any ordinary life, which begins with seemingly endless possibilities and then dwindles until death forecloses further choice. I wish I'd seen Sally Hawkins and Rafe Spall in the London debut, but the director Michael Longhurst has found very fine replacements in Gyllenhaal and Wilson. They have a lovely time playing with the script and with each other -- Wilson with her pointy, pouty features and wonderfully manic energy, Gyllenhaal with his bushy beard and earthier charms. He relies perhaps a bit heavily on blokiness and she on intensity, but they ably vary the mood of each new scene. And though the play fixes on physics, rest assured the chemistry is ample.

Repeatedly in Constellations, the playwright mines the profundity in the most seemingly mundane conversations...Gyllenhaal, whose performance is as disciplined as it is vigorous, instills the questions with the kind of barely controlled desperation they demand. Wilson...is an irresistibly vital presence, veering from loose-limbed goofiness to earthy sensuality as Marianne seduces Roland with her knowledge of atoms and molecules.

But British playwright Nick Payne's beguiling Constellations is not only a full-bodied narrative, it's a richly affecting experience.

Another peril would be to let his way of repeating short scenes with different emphases suggest just an acting exercise. Or worse, upon learning that the action takes place in ""The Multiverse"" of the ""Past, Present and Future"" and that a character is a quantum cosmologist, one could be excused for dreading a physics lesson. In fact, with actors less compelling and unpretentiously appealing as Jake Gyllenhaal and Ruth Wilson, it's likely that this deeply moving and unpredictable romance would never have made it to Broadway at all.

Their relationship and its challenges -- infidelity, illness, death -- vary in ways that sometimes reflect nuances of their behavior and sometimes stem from forces beyond their control...Informed by authors like Jorge Luis Borges and Caryl Churchill, Constellations is smart but not dry; its focus is on the personal and emotional, and Gyllenhaal and Wilson reboot themselves convincingly at every stutter and turn.

Wilson won her Golden Globe for The Affair and she has an off-kilter comic sensibility that works beautifully with her grounded co-star. They have great chemistry and charm here, even when saying and doing preposterous things, frequently at the same time. I was rooting for them all the way. Under Michael Longhurst's timing-is-everything direction, they work very hard at this repeated-scene business, which can't be easy. As an exercise in physical comedy, Constellations is a neat trick.

After dozens of short scenes and stops and starts, plus many lighting changes and a few balloons falling to the ground, the relationship has seemingly come full circle. The play manages to feel slight and jam-packed at the same time, combining an uninteresting boy-meets-girl romance and a well-worn premise of right turn versus left turn with a hard-to-follow structure. I actually found myself more interested in figuring out the symbolism of the set design than in following the plot.

Unfortunately it's not the one now running at the Manhattan Theatre Club under the title Constellations, even though all those things do happen in it.

The time-is-a-flat-circle conceit has been overplayed in pop culture of late...Wilson is brilliant, dramatically altering key moments with the tiniest of inflections, and Gyllenhaal brings psychological depth to Roland.

Disgraced,9,"Review: Broadway's 'Disgraced' Is Raw, Blistering","Akhtar's blistering ""Disgraced"" opened Thursday on Broadway at the Lyceum Theatre with a punch and power that won it a Pulitzer Prize. Few playwrights are examining what Akhtar does, certainly not with his insightfulness, and his play is breathtaking -- and not a little uncomfortable -- to watch. In the best of ways. An excellent five-person cast led by Hari Dhillon -- and beautifully directed by Kimberly Senior -- starts the play with swagger and confidence, building to horrific exchanges in which they are at each other's throats...Dhillon nails the master-of-the-universe strut and moves across the stage almost like a boxer when his anger is fueled, making his fall all the more painful, while Mol skillfully lets a silent gulf slowly emerge between her and her husband. But perhaps the best performances are turned in by Radnor (TV's ""How I Met Your Mother"") and Pittman (Broadway's ""Good People""), two natural stage actors who get to be funny, outraged, needy, broken and feisty -- and manage to do it all in the 90-minute work.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,10/23/2014
Disgraced,9,Broadway Review: ‘Disgraced’,"Issue-driven plays are thought to be relatively impervious to production vagaries. That's generally true of Akhtar's perhaps overly schematic play, which is constructed like a house of cards, its highly civilized human relationships in perfect harmony until someone breaks out of character and throws them all off balance...Some of the production alterations for Broadway are purely cosmetic. Being more elaborate, John Lee Beatty's set design of a stylish Manhattan apartment (a terrace!) and Jennifer Von Mayrhauser's fashionable costumes put more emphasis on the elegant life style of the characters. The new cast, including Josh Radnor as the curator, is perfectly satisfactory, but so was the original one that played in the smaller-scale production at Lincoln Center...But it must be said that replacing Aasif Mandvi...as Amir with Dhillon...puts a new perspective on the central character.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,10/23/2014

""Disgraced"" is essentially a modern tragedy, leaving its audience in a state of fear and pity. Just as Oedipus was helpless to alter his fate, Amir is seemingly unable to escape his heritage. Kimberly Senior's engrossing production is marked by strong performances all around.

However, to get the quibbles out of the way first, any flaws are most likely to be noticed by that small handful of the audience returning to Disgraced after seeing its superior previous incarnation...Radnor (How I Met Your Mother) is a standout among the accomplished cast, walking a fine line between relaxed charm and smug condescension as a man unaccustomed to self-examination.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,10/23/2014

The plot is mainly a vehicle getting its characters to a place where they show the cracks within carefully constructed social attitudes of worldliness or multiculti tolerance...Akhtar may not have revolutionary things to say about poorly repressed animosities between East and West, but he says them eloquently and passionately.

Disgraced,8,'Disgraced' review: Explosive Islamic politics on Broadway,"Now finally, ""Disgraced"" has opened on Broadway, directed again by Senior but with less compressed tension and with four of the five characters recast. The play remains a smart and provocative work of unusual daring, one that should be seen by anyone who cares about serious theater and the knotted tangles of tribal beliefs that lurk under civilized layers of educated, liberal professionals. But the magic is missing at the center and that magic was Aasif Mandvi...Dhillon's Amir is more dashing and tightly wired, but without the charisma and likability that first must humanize a man who challenges us in monstrous ways. This Amir doesn't shock us enough when the politics of race and gender explode the tolerance of two upscale Manhattan couples...Nothing is sacred -- the Quran, the Old Testament, terrorism, art history, cultural tourism, ancient prejudices and blazing ambivalence -- as Akhtar rubs unexpected raw spots with enormous intelligence and humor. Too bad Broadway doesn't get to feel all the burn.",Newsday,Linda Winer,10/23/2014
Disgraced,8,"'Disgraced' makes you laugh and think, to a point","By the end of Disgraced, Amir -- who seemed so richly human earlier, with his capacity for arrogance and shame and fear and pride and empathy -- has been reduced nearly to a victim, and his potentially intriguing journey to a sort of cautionary tale about ambition and bigotry. To Akhtar's credit, and that of director Kimberly Senior and her excellent cast, that tale is at least fun to watch. Hari Dhillon makes Amir...charming and frustrating, showing us both his cultivated slickness and his ongoing struggle to reconcile what he's experienced...with what he's become. Gretchen Mol movingly conveys Emily's own conflicts, and her fundamental decency.Josh Radnor and Karen Pittman provide witty, full-blooded performances as the Kapoors' guests, who seem to have their own issues...Their combined efforts make Disgraced consistently entertaining and thought-provoking -- just not as much as you wish it were.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,10/23/2014

Religion, race, politics -- it's probably good to avoid these controversial matters altogether, and focus on more agreeable subjects. Like the weather. Perhaps if the two couples in ""Disgraced"" would have taken that advice, they would have avoided a whole lot of trouble and pain. Then again, if the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by Ayad Akhtar, now open at the Lyceum Theatre, stayed away from such discourse, we wouldn't have been treated to one of the season's most engaging nights of theater...It's easily the most impassioned dinner scenes on Broadway since ""August: Osage County,"" and one that playwright Akhtar crafts beautifully. His dialogue is intelligent and superb -- his characters so complex yet well-defined -- that you'll travel along the ride of emotions and ideas not knowing where you're going next.

Director Kimberly Senior...shows an admirable restraint in her well-paced scenes...Dhillon, an American-born actor who's spent much of his career working in the U.K., shows more stiff-upper-lip reserve in the early scenes, merely pacing and fidgeting to signal Amir's discomfort in his own skin. It's an approach that doesn't go far enough to establish Amir's coiled volatility.

Two minutes into the dinner party, his ethnic construct doesn't seem contrived. It recedes, the Indian -- and African American characters turn out to be the foursomes' bona fide conservatives, and soon there's much more violence on stage than ever entered the heads of George, Martha, and guests. But, and this is a significant ""but,"" there's another 30 minutes to ""Disgraced.""

Disgraced,7,Theater Review: The Believable Gut-Punch of Disgraced,"This bigger, more glamorous Broadway version exposes more faults and infelicities, but also strips away one's liberal pieties more effectively. Perhaps Disgraced won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize not so much for drama as for bravery...Akhbar's craft is such that, amid the rubble of his argument, the questions -- and they are important ones, worth asking on Broadway -- survive. Perhaps, after all, the argument was just a house for the questions, and not, as is more typical, vice versa...In general, though, the Broadway resizing and recasting does not work to the play's advantage. Kimberly Senior's direction grows stronger as the play proceeds, but nearly derails the story at the start, with confusing staging and flaccid pacing. And though Hari Dhillon is riveting in his unraveling, he does not make us understand, as the charming Aasif Mandvi did Off Broadway, what was so delightful about Amir before the trouble began.",Vulture,Jesse Green,10/23/2014
Disgraced,7,Repeat Until Done,"This is a genuinely provocative premise for an issue-driven play, and Mr. Akhtar deserves much credit for grappling honestly and forthrightly with what in other hands could easily have become a mealy-mouthed exercise in can't-we-all-get-along difference-splitting. Unfortunately, his dramaturgy isn't as impressive as his nerve. Not only do his characters spend far too much of the evening making speeches to one another, but every ""surprise"" is telegraphed so far in advance of its eventual arrival that you find yourself getting actively impatient for the reveals. It doesn't help that the climax of ""Disgraced"" is a get-the-guests dinner party that starts off with competitive upper-middle-class brand-dropping in the manner of Tom Wolfe (much is made of the fact that Amir wears $600 Charvet shirts to the office) and builds up to a full-scale brawl in which the participants, having downed a couple of drinks too many, rip off their masks of comfy tolerance and reveal themselves to be....wait for it...BIGOTS!",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,10/23/2014

Kimberly Senior, who directed the world premiere at Lincoln Center, guides a good-looking and handsomely acted production...Like sports cars, the actors hugs their characters' curves. Dhillon, who played his role in London, nails Amir's glossy arrogance and sense of loss. Emily is sympathetic, as played by a low-key and quiet Mol, while Radnor is convincing and natural. Pittman, an Off-Broadway holdover, again delivers a precise turn as pointed as Jory's sexy stilettos.

Disgraced,6,Gretchen Mol Tackles Brutal ‘Disgraced',"Timely dramas on Broadway are in very short supply, and that alone makes the bow of Disgraced an event worth applauding...The play has lost its essential velocity in the move from Lincoln Center Theater, where Amir was played with a thousand volts of electricity by Aasif Mandvi...On the stage of the tiny Claire Tow Theater, Mandvi seemed ready to explode at any second. Dhillon is clearly a skilled actor, but his Amir doesn't fibrillate with the pent-up anger the character needs if he is to be credible. This may have something to do, as well, with the ciphered performance by Mol, who seems to be sleepwalking through the show. She's out of her league on the Broadway stage, and you can sense from the other actors that she's giving them nothing to work with. The dazzler in this production, staged again by Kimberly Senior, is Pittman, taut and almost serenely tough...It still raises deeply discomfiting questions.

But the bigger stage hasn't been kind to the show. Because the play seems like a PowerPoint lecture about current hot topics -- terrorism, Islam, Jews, religion, art -- it requires excellent acting. Pity the performances here are wildly uneven, and a couple of them are downright bad. Purists may look suspiciously at Josh Radnor...But Radnor's actually quite good as Isaac, a smarmy, smug Whitney Museum curator -- and Karen Pittman, the original cast's lone survivor, is even better as Isaac's no-nonsense wife, Jory.

Its idea of an au courant namedrop is Trotsky. But in this, the third of the eight 1930s collaborations between George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, the dramatic architecture feels more purpose-built than those once-modish elements might suggest. The whimsy is tactical. The period is crucial. And the play's argument requires its big structure. That argument, as the title indicates, is about the uses of money: a topic no less worthy of consideration in 1938, when the country was leaping from depression toward war, than it is today, when it is doing something similar.",Vulture,Jesse Green,09/28/2014

But the embrace by the Sycamores of their quirky individualism feels less than total. That seems especially true for Jones, who, in the guise of the family patriarch, proves a genial rather than compelling presence. When he expounds on his character's peculiar philosophy - why, for example, Grandpa Martin doesn't pay taxes - it isn't with the kind of conviction that helps us understand, or giggle at, the sort of quaint contrarian he is meant to be.

The River,5,'The River' with Hugh Jackman is an elusive drama with little mainstream appeal,"Hugh Jackman deserves a lot of credit for returning to the New York stage in ""The River,"" a new work by the little-known English playwright Jez Butterworth (""Jerusalem""), considering that most major film stars come to Broadway in revivals of fail-proof, classic dramas (i.e. Denzel Washington in ""A Raisin in the Sun,"" Scarlett Johansson in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof""). ""The River"" is, instead, a quiet, elusive drama with little mainstream appeal.",amNY,Matt Windman,11/16/2014
The River,5,'The River': Theater Review,"English playwright Jez Butterworth gave himself a tough act to follow with 2009's Jerusalem... The River, a lyrical chamber piece that runs just 85 minutes, shares certain elements with the earlier play, notably a ruggedly masculine protagonist, a bucolic setting and a dual fascination with nature and myth. But despite the considerable charisma and commitment of its outsize star, Hugh Jackman, this new work is a sliver of a mood piece that never tightens its grip.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,11/16/2014
The River,5,"Hugh Jackman is wasting his time, and ours, in ‘The River’","If ""The River"" was playing some dinky little theater with a bunch of unknowns, it'd be dismissed as flimsy and gimmicky. Yet the above description still applies: This show is overreaching and underachieving, its hollow pretentiousness even more glaring under the bright Broadway lights. Playwright Jez Butterworth's previous effort, the Tony-nominated ""Jerusalem,"" was overrated, but compared to this, it's a masterpiece. At least Ian Rickson's production - he also directed the London premiere, starring Dominic West (""The Affair"") - looks good. Ultz's rustic set and Ian Dickinson's elaborate sound design make the most of the Circle in the Square's in-the-round design, taking us to a lived-in cabin by a babbling brook.",NY Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,11/16/2014
The Last Ship,9,Review: Sting's 'The Last Ship' is thrilling stuff,"Sting's stage composing is nicely complex, mixing sassy ballads with brooding duets and big, violin-led crowd pleasers. Outstanding are ""Dead Man's Boots"" and ""The Night the Pugilist Learned How to Dance,"" which here is wonderfully staged between a father and son behind bars, and the simply beautiful title track, which the creators clearly know is good: It's leaned on no less than four times.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,10/23/2014
The Last Ship,9,"Sting revisits roots in buoyant, moving 'Last Ship'","The songs, despite a few maudlin touches, are melodically and emotionally vital, offering potent vehicles for performers such as the wonderful Fred Applegate, cast as Father O'Brien, and Jimmy Nail, who plays a crusty veteran laborer, and whose smoky but siren-like voice evokes Sting's more nearly than Esper's. By the deeply affecting final scene, Gideon, Meg and the others have learned that love, in all of its forms, can involve letting go - of grievances, dreams, even people. That's hardly a novel concept, but The Last Ship makes it feel surprisingly fresh.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,10/23/2014
The Last Ship,9,Sting's the Last Ship: The Prodigal Son Returns,"At its core, The Last Ship poses a religious quest for redemption: Father Jim (Fred Applegate) hears Gideon's confession of sins of the flesh, drink, and foul talk. But hey, this father has a few foibles of his own. His heart is so big, he inspires Gideon and the entire community, characters we come to know and love in the pub, and at the ship yard where industry is closing, turning from the actual building of ships, the mainstay of these hearty, lively folk, to jobs akin to pencil pushing. The company, led by Jimmy Nail as Jackie White and Sally Ann Triplett as his wife Peggy, won't have it, and they rally to erect just one more ship, the last one, which, as in the epics of old, will carry a body out to sea.",Huffington Post,Regina Weinreich,10/23/2014

One is very effective, the other not so much.",NY Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,10/23/2014
The Last Ship,8,"Review: ""The Last Ship"" Is a High-Water Mark for Sting","It's a familiar story that in lesser hands would quickly wobble under its weight.
As it happens, a great cast, led by Esper and Rachel Tucker (a one-time West End Elphaba, in ""Wicked"") as Meg, that one-time love, prevent that from transpiring. It's bracing to see Esper in a more adult, even paternal role, and it's one he pulls off with charisma. That Esper's Gideon must somehow make peace with his past, the abusive father and so on, is a foregone conclusion, but his methods of doing so struck me as exceedingly honest.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,10/23/2014

The book, by John Logan (""Red"") and Brian Yorkey (""Next to Normal""), and inspired in part by Sting's own upbringing in the northeast England town Wallsend, where the show is set, is unfocused and diffuse.

Melancholy tones of sorrow and regret saturate this highly personal and intensely felt musical play, which is set in Wallsend, the industrial town in the north of England where the singer-songwriter grew up. The somber book by John Logan and Brian Yorkey takes place in 2007, the year the historic shipyard closed and the town lost its purpose and identity. The lyrical language of Sting's mournful score gives poetic voice to the distressed shipbuilders, but depicting their story as a heroic allegory is regrettably alienating.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,10/23/2014
The Last Ship,7,Sting's 'Last Ship' is a 'see'-worthy musical,"In a refreshing change of protocol, Sting has written a new score in a folk Celtic style, full of sweeping choral and orchestral arrangements and unabashed, open-hearted sentiment. The originality and sincerity of the enterprise are certainly worthy of applause. Joe Mantello's production manages to be thoroughly atmospheric without turning into a spectacle. (Spoiler alert: We only see a small portion of the ship.)",amNY,Matt Windman,10/23/2014
The Last Ship,7,'The Last Ship': Theater Review,So what's missing? It's easy to see the central figure of Gideon Fletcher as a romanticized alter ego of Sting (Gordon Sumner at birth). But the plodding book by John Logan and Brian Yorkey gives him too little psychological dimension to come alive. It also strands him among generic characters and clichéd situations seen in countless Brit films set in depressed industrial towns blighted by Thatcherism.

The Last Ship,5,‘The Last Ship’ Theater Review: Sting Takes a Cruise to Nowhere,"In ""The Last Ship,"" director Joe Mantello gives us one scene in which workmen stomp around (intense choreography by Steven Hoggett) and brandish blowtorches (big sparklers, actually) that literally scorch the air around them. But nothing really happens. Eventually, something like a ship is vaguely indicated when the stage rises, everybody jumps aboard singing, there's light from heaven, and a tsunami of sound envelopes us.

The Last Ship,5,Theater: 'The Last Ship',"The musical's book, written by John Logan and Brian Yorkey, settles for simply pushing the story forward, from A to B to C. But the failure also falls on Sting, who created the inexpressive score, in his theater-writing debut. The songs permit the characters to reveal their feelings - ""I love you. I hate you"" - but not who they are and why they have those feelings. And while there are some nice melodies, especially a gentle courting song, ""What Say You, Meg?"" much of the score consists of thumping declarations and anthems.

There really isn’t enough story or music for two acts.

Once,7,Once Review: Falling Slowly on Broadway,"Once stays homey, charming, and inviting; on a smaller scale than usual for a Broadway musical, which turns out to be a good thing. It is also slow moving and slight. It requires patience, or at least the right mind-set, to fall for this show (Falling slowly, indeed.) The musical is an hour longer than the movie. But even with John Carney’s movie script adapted by a first-rate playwright, Enda Walsh (whose most recent play produced in New York was the eerie Misterman), the story in Once the musical is only a bit less sketchy than the film.",Faster Times,Jonathan Mandell,03/18/2012

That makes it a visual treat, but eye candy takes you only so far...Thomas has boyish charm, but Pippin hasn't changed by the time he chooses to settle down at the closing...Gorgeous Patina Miller...seems robotic here, another victim of the leeching of sex from the show.

Only one moment, centered on Andrea Martin as the title character's grandmother, achieves that kind of transcendence.

Pippin,6,Theater Review: Big Top Pippin,"Still, distraction, even when it's enchanting and absolutely necessary, is not itself a viable dramaturgy. If Paulus has succeeded, against the odds, in shaping a satisfying modern Broadway spectacle from material that's fairly empty...it's because she must have realized that the other thing she needed was an actor who could definitively cut through the dreck. Enter Andrea Martin as Pippin's feisty grandma, Berthe. A ham's ham but one with total discipline, Martin is both warm and demanding; she knows when to let out some line and when to snap it back...The somewhat stiff, presentational style of the other actors (Patina Miller as the Leading Player is awesome but not exactly mellow) relaxes, and so does the audience, now confident of getting what it came for.",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/25/2013

Ceaselessly grinning, quivering with energy, singing at full throttle, Miller is impressive but so relentless in her triple-threat attack that she becomes somewhat tiresome...As the ringmaster of this bustling production, Paulus perhaps has been cracking her whip too often for the show's good.

The 31-year-old Culkin...is undeniably too old for the role, but he perfectly captures Dennis' youthful braggadocio as well as his carefully hidden insecurities...Cera...Playing not too far from his familiar dorky screen persona, he makes an impressive stage debut, fully mining the pathos and humor of the fumbling Warren and easily scoring the evening's biggest laughs. The 18-year-old, waif-like Gevinson has no such problem in terms of age...But the awkwardness she displays onstage, whether intentional or not, works beautifully for the role of a young woman struggling with a transition into adulthood, and her off-kilter line readings are consistently engaging.",Hollywood Reporter,Frank Scheck,09/11/2014

Even so, it suits his character and he brings plenty of laughs. The 18-year-old Gevinson, who has terrific rapport with Cera, vigorously conveys Jessica's suspicious nature.

Shapiro's superlative direction uses it to fuel an unforgettable performance, the more so for marking his New York stage debut. As the overliteral, quasi-Asperger's lost-soul 19-year-old Warren Straub...he digs so far into the character's drugged-out disappointment you see only the shadows of it rippling the surface.

Culkin's Dennis, a repository of self-regarding bravado whose out-of-control drug-dealing has prompted his rich parents to banish him to an apartment of his own, is no less remarkable: The bullying bile he aims at Cera's cowed Warren is spewed with magnum comic impact. And Gevinson, as self-conscious Jessica Goldman, a girl so contrary she manages to turn Warren's admiration for her into something bitter, makes the acting triumph here a triumvirate. What she and Cera do with a twisting scene, built around Warren's gift to her of a sentimental item, is itself a little treasure.",Washington Post,Peter Marks,09/11/2014

But she manages to mine the wry humor and pathos in Youth's portrait of privileged despair and spiritual malaise...Sadly, Gevinson, who plays Jessica, is the production's weak link. Squirming and shouting her lines in a high-pitched whine that suggests barely repressed hysteria, she overplays Jessica's feigned confidence and confusion, making Warren's enduring attraction to her less convincing.

Shapiro's clear-eyed and tight staging brings out earnest, honest performances from the young trio. Cera's facial deadpan and vocal drone have the curious effect of deepening, not lessening, our sympathy for Warren.

The Country House,7,'The Country House' review: Banter in the Berkshires,"It is easy to understand why playwrights, especially those fascinated by the layers of human relationships, are drawn to the work of Anton Chekhov...Except for the fine cast led by the formidably elegant Blythe Danner, however, there is little else that feels right enough about ""The Country House."" Margulies...is straining here to update Chekhov's ""The Seagull"" to a summer house full of theater people at the Williamstown Theatre Festival...Of course, it is always a pleasure to watch Danner have her way with a big character, even such a familiar one as the shrewd, tempestuous, increasingly insecure theatrical diva...[but] the banter is hackneyed and, ultimately, the crises are pointless. Worse, these people are dull.",Newsday,Linda Winer,10/02/2014
The Country House,7,Blythe Danner shines in Donald Margulies’ ‘The Country House’,"...this comfort-food of a play by Donald Margulies (""Time Stands Still"") is like Goldilocks' porridge: not too hot, not too cold -- just . . . lukewarm...Margulies draws from Chekhov, especially ""The Seagull"" and ""Uncle Vanya,"" for his fractious weekend in the country. Spotting the parallels will keep you busy for a while, along with Danner, who's amusing and blessedly restrained in a role that could easily have turned into a caricature. Steele, so good as Alan Cumming's daughter on ""The Good Wife,"" is earthy and keen, her character a breath of fresh air in this hothouse of self-regard. Under the direction of the prolific Daniel Sullivan, classy and subdued as usual, the show trots along at a solid clip, dotted with the expected bon mots...episodes of painful truth-telling, arguments and fights. Add a typically luxurious set by John Lee Beatty and you've got yourself a pleasant evening out. And yes, that is faint praise.",NY Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,10/02/2014
The Country House,7,‘The Country House’ Theater Review: Blythe Danner Plays a Mommie Chilliest,"It's also not a good idea to have your wisest character reprimand another character for ""sounding like a Lifetime movie"" when, in fact, Margulies turns his second act into a Lifetime movie...After Danner's playing good cop to Robert De Niro's bad cop in all those ""Focker"" movies, it's fun to see her let go with a bad-momma character. Actually, Anna's not even a bad mom; rather, she's just a little chilly. And Danner plays chilly with real panache...""The Country House"" is actually two plays: the sentimental drama of the second act, and the sitcom comedy of the first act. No wonder director Daniel Sullivan can't make sense of it. He has no choice but to open the play with broad performances to replicate what's happening in the cute twists of the overly complicated plot.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,10/02/2014
The Country House,6,'The Country House': Theater Review,"Timing is everything. Donald Margulies respectfully raids the Chekhovian thematic pantry in The Country House, which arrives on Broadway in an elegant production staged with customary polish by Daniel Sullivan and starring Blythe Danner in a role that overlaps with her own professional history. But coming in the wake of Christopher Durang's far more illuminating contemporary riff on the Russian master, Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike, seriously undercuts the usefulness of this engaging, if rather safe, middlebrow entertainment.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,10/02/2014
The Country House,6,The Country House,"If you're the kind of person who enjoys Chekhov but wishes it were more, you know, relatable--a kind of person who probably doesn't and certainly shouldn't exist-then The Country House is just the play for you. Donald Margulies's dozy family drama transplants Uncle Vanya to a cottage near the theater retreat of Williamstown, with modern jokes and bits of The Seagull patched in for variety...The essential banality of this bubbleless soap seems intended to be tempered by our inherent fascination with show business. The play depicts an insular and obsolescent theater world, and exemplifies it.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,10/02/2014
The Country House,6,Review: “The Country House” Is No Vacation,"Regrettably, the action in the play...is far too contrived to make much of an impact...Margulies, supposedly, was heavily influenced by Chekhov, cutting and pasting characters and situations from ""The Seagull"" and ""Uncle Vanya"" to craft ""The Country House."" Perhaps that explains why the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, of ""Dinner with Friends"" and ""Time Stand Still,"" is so muddled here. He seems bound by his device, not propelled by it...Despite a rocky structure, there are some winning performances. Danner is a treat as the steadfast and strong Anna, giving gravity and poise to a woman grieving the loss of her daughter and her youth. The venerable actress moves through much of the material here with ease, and you'll be glad she's leading the ship.",NBC New York,David Quinn,10/02/2014
The Country House,6,"‘The Country House,’ theater review","The curtain rises on ""The Country House"" by Donald Margulies to reveal a snazzy living room -- and you just know things will get ugly. That's standard operating Broadway procedure: Cozy interior, turbulent encounters. And aside from one exceptional performance, this clichéd, but ultimately harmless, comedy-drama directed by Daniel Sullivan is an old-fashioned, by-the-numbers affair...Margulies skimps on character details but gives his creations the gift of gab...The cast proves capable. Danner is solid in a role that's not much of a stretch. Lange turns on the emotions as required when the story takes a turn to ""Ordinary People"" territory. Sunjata adds appeal as a sudden celebrity. Best of all, Steele transforms her character from more than a wounded, walking wisecrack into the show's heart and soul.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,10/02/2014
The Country House,6,Theater Review: The Country House Needs a Total Renovation,"What went wrong? Manhattan Theater Club, which did such a fine job on Margulies's Time Stands Still four years ago, has applied its usual polish, with Daniel Sullivan again directing. Yet the tone wobbles like one of those air socks at a car dealership: now inflated, now bent, mostly becalmed and flaccid. Perhaps the problem is that the play was purpose-built, commissioned by MTC, and too closely tailored to the interests, if not the real talents, of its star. Neither Danner nor the rest of the well-cast cast (Daniel Sunjata as the action star and Sarah Steele as the Yalie at least look spot-on) are able to get out ahead of their characters, to apply that spin that can make theater people, with their ludicrous vanities and bitter envy, enjoyable to watch. As a result, Anna and the others all just seem vain and entitled, which may have been accurate up in the Berkshires in Psacharopoulos's day but was never much worth watching.",Vulture,Jesse Green,10/02/2014
The Country House,6,A ‘Country House’ Divided,"To single out Ms. Steele and Mr. Lange is not, however, to suggest that their colleagues are less than excellent. They are, in fact, uniformly superior, and Daniel Sullivan has staged the play with an ungimmicky simplicity that allows each one to shine in turn-but it is the author who makes them real. If ""The Country House"" is a backstage drama by virtue of its setting, its actual subject is how the members of a close family can hurt one another without meaning to do so. You needn't have done time on the far side of the proscenium to know all about that, to recognize how fully Mr. Margulies understands it or to appreciate the seasoned skill with which he has turned that hurt into the stuff of a truly affecting play.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,10/02/2014
The Country House,5,First Nighter: Is Donald Margulies's 'Country House' Too Chekhovian or Not Chekhovian Enough?,"Some plays about actors, acting and other theater concerns can be quite good--a worthy example being Anton Chekhov's 1895 work, The Seagull. Most plays about actors, acting and other theater concerns, however, are not so rewarding. Sorry to say that one of them is Donald Margulies's newest comedy-drama, The Country House...Curiously, one of the reasons the play falls short of Pulitzer Prize-winning Margulies's usual vaunted mark is that he's chosen, as many playwrights before him have, to make The Country House an homage to Chekhov...Although the characters forge through a good deal during the two acts, torpor gathers quickly. Something stultifying creeps in that lends The Country House the feel of a middling sitcom...As modern-day Chekhov counterparts, the six actors here acquit themselves well. To pay them and director Sullivan the best compliment under these circumstances is to say it would be a pleasure to see them tackling the real thing(s).",Huffington Post,David Finkle,10/02/2014
Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill,9,Review: Audra McDonald divinely channels Lady Day,"It's sad without being maudlin, a history lesson without being preachy. It's earthy and seemingly honest. Since her death, Billie Holiday, who was raped and mistreated and jailed, has become a siren for singers, her tortured life and vocals too rich too pass up. McDonald does honor to her troubled spirit...As for the singing, it's a testament to McDonald, who has one of the strongest voices in musical theater, that she molds hers to fit Holiday's sound, whether it's in a subdued ""Crazy He Calls Me"" or a sassy ""Baby Doll."" She manages to capture that smoky, peanut-buttery, sometimes staccato delivery. It's haunting. Close your eyes and Lady Day is back.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,04/13/2014
Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill,9,Audra McDonald offers a moving night with 'Lady Day',"McDonald gets to show off her comedic skills, naughtily teasing her conductor and pianist (the excellent Shelton Becton) and wandering among the audience members who sit at tables incorporated into the set. At one point, her Holiday heads for the bottles of booze lined up in back of them and pours herself a strong one; at another, she nuzzles her pet pooch, Pepi (played by a sweetly poised rescue dog named Roxie)...Not surprisingly, though, Lady Day is at its most potent when the songs speak for her. McDonald delivers a beautifully phrased God Bless the Child, an enchanting Crazy He Calls Me, a chilling Strange Fruit.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,04/13/2014
Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill,9,'Lady Day' review: Audra McDonald as Billie Holiday,"In Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill, a late entry in the Broadway season, McDonald has taken on the task of impersonating a real person in what's virtually a solo show about the late jazz singer Billie Holiday, whose rough life story is almost as familiar as her distinctive sound...McDonald doesn't let Holiday wallow as she tells us, almost offhandedly, about her rape at 10, her prostitution at 14, the macabre death of her great-grandmother, a slave, and the racism that haunted her career. Long before we are shocked, yet again, by the haunting images of her great song about racism, ""Strange Fruit,"" this amazing actress and this jazz icon are indivisible.",Newsday,Linda Winer,04/13/2014
Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill,9,Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill: Theater Review,"Along with salty humor, joy, bitterness and plummeting despair, that sense of suffering as a constant companion permeates and elevates Lanie Robertson's slender yet affecting bio-play with music, crafted as a woozy late-night concert in the South Philly locale of the title, a few months before the singer's death...Watching such a consummate performer lose herself in the character and her music, it's clear there's not just diligent research here but also a profound empathy with the tragic struggle of Holiday's tempestuous life...There's an inevitable artificiality about so much biographical data being stuffed into a ""concert"" performance, and Price adds to that informational aspect by beaming superfluous photographs and other visual aids onto the rear wall. But compared to the clunky Garland or Joplin shows mentioned earlier, Robertson's play incorporates his subject's background with sufficient economy to maintain the illusion of a spontaneous performance.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/13/2014
Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill,9,Broadway Review: ‘Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar & Grill’ Starring Audra McDonald,"The ungainly stage at Broadway's Circle in the Square has proved an inspiration for set designer James Noone to recreate Emerson's Bar & Grill, the seedy joint in North Philadelphia where Billie Holiday played one of her last club dates in 1959, three months before she died...It's a known fact that McDonald is a majestic singer. (Maybe the best Bess, of ""Porgy and Bess,"" our modern stage has seen.) In more than a dozen songs, she captures the plaintive sound, the eccentric phrasing and all the little vocal catches that identify Billie Holiday's unique style. But it's her extraordinary sensitivity as an actor that makes McDonald's interpretation memorable.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,04/13/2014
Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill,9,BWW Reviews: McDonald Mesmerizes in LADY DAY AT EMERSON'S BAR AND GRILL,"But little of that matters once McDonald takes the stage. So immediately stunning is the accuracy of her replication of Holiday's timbre and inflections at that point of her life that many of Thursday night's audience responded with applause a mere eight bars into her opening performance of 'I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone.' So galvanizing is McDonald's work that it wasn't until midway through the performance that I began to notice images being projected in back of her. Never mind them. You won't want to draw your attention away from Audra McDonald for a moment. As the saying goes, there's a lady on stage, and not only is she an entrancing singer, but she's one hell of an actor.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,04/13/2014
Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill,9,STAGE REVIEW Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill,"While McDonald's vocal inflections can seem a tad overstudied in the show's opening number, 'I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone,' as she spits out breaths at the end of each musical phrase, the actress quickly settles into the role and erases all memory of her operatic belter's soprano and her naturally bubbly personality. In their place: a voice both smoky and breathy, and a demeanor that suggests a hard-lived life in the first half of the 20th century. The physicality of her portrayal is similarly remarkable.",Entertainment Weekly,Thom Geier,04/13/2014
Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill,9,First Nighter: Audra McDonald Dazzles as Billie Holiday,"Perhaps the most complimentary remark to be made about Audra McDonald in Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill is that in 90 minutes and under Lonny Price's fully empathetic direction, she nails that voice and she gets that whole life.

Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill,8,‘Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar & Grill’: Theater review,"The much-decorated McDonald - five Tonys and counting - evokes the tough steel and rough velvet of Holiday's singing with uncanny precision. But this isn't about mimicry. It's about the heart and soul, bruised and battered, that comes through. Audra McDonald channels Billie Holiday in Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill. This is McDonald at her most intimate. Director Lonny Price has Holiday roam the audience bumming cigarettes and drinks. The play is the story of a women whose gift was her voice. The final moment - in dead silence - is shattering. Ooh, ooh, ooh, indeed.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,04/13/2014
Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill,8,Stepping Into the Shoes of a Ravaged Singer,"We hear much (too much) of this sorry story during the show, written by Lanie Robertson and directed by Lonny Price, and first produced Off Broadway in 1986...Mr. Robertson has created a persuasive voice for these reflections, salty and sassy, occasionally flaring into hot bursts of anger, and prone to gin-fueled digressions. Ms. McDonald moves between the moods with a jittery sharpness, conveying the warmth and humor in bright, glowing bursts that can quickly subside into dark, bitter ruminations on the wayward, reckless groove into which her life gradually fell...Still, it's worth putting up with the show's tackier (and duller) aspects for the pleasure of hearing Ms. McDonald breathe aching life into some of Holiday's greatest songs.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,04/13/2014
Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill,8,Audra McDonald is spellbinding in 'Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill',"It is often said that Holiday cannot be authentically imitated or covered. That's probably true. But as directed by Lonnie Price, McDonald undergoes a complete transformation vocally and physically, a la Meryl Streep, that is highly theatrical but believable and seemingly effortless. It's easy to forget that the play is pretty thin thanks to her transfixing performance. McDonald forsakes her rich singing abilities to capture Holiday's distinctively small and scratchy voice. But more than that, she credibly and powerfully inhabits a disoriented woman who is slurring her words and appears to be lost both emotionally and mentally.",amNY,Matt Windman,04/13/2014

On the other, there's the raspy-voiced Billie Holiday, who lifted herself from the gutter to achieve fame as a jazz singer, only to crash out on drink and drugs. Talk about casting against type.

Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill,8,Theater Review: How Much Can Audra McDonald Sound Like Billie Holiday?,"You will undoubtedly hear that what Audra McDonald is doing as Billie Holiday in Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill is not an impersonation. It is, though. However much more it eventually becomes, it starts with capturing that eccentric, heartbreaking voice - and the capture is uncanny. Right from the first syllables of ""I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone,"" which opens the show, McDonald nails the pinched tone, side-mouth delivery, and precipitous register leaps of Holiday in her heyday. Consonants are negotiable: ""love"" is more like ""luhw."" Final vowels become dramatic opportunities: ""Hear my plea-uh and hurry home to me-uh!"" Pitch is obscure or even absent; some notes sound fried in place yet remain part of the melody. McDonald's Holiday doesn't so much sing as play her voice, like a saxophone, with perfect confidence in (or indifference to) its expressive powers.",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/13/2014
Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill,7,Theater review: 'Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill',"Under the direction of Lonny Price, the evening is a stinging portrait of a great artist's failed life. But even with deep admiration for McDonald's potent acting, the evening feels out of balance. The details of Holiday's story are already well-known, so it doesn't have the allure of revelation. (The same material was covered last year in the off-Broadway bio-musical ""Lady Day."") What the production does offer that's fresh, exciting and irresistibly entertaining is McDonald singing Holiday. Too bad the vivid evening wasn't more strongly tilted in that direction.",Bergen Record,Robert Feldberg,04/13/2014
Bullets Over Broadway,9,'Bullets over Broadway': Musical of mobsters and old standards,"Pastore is exceedingly funny, as is the delicious Marin Mazzie, who blows her way deliciously and fearlessly through the Dianne Wiest role in the film... Brooks Ashmanskas eats his way through the night as the gourmand-actor Warner Purcell, and Nick Cordero stays sandpaper dry, perhaps to a fault, as Cheech... And Lenny Wolpe holds down the normative character, the agent Julian Marx, whose job is to set up the funny lines of the wackos and keep the narrative moving. There are, for sure, times when ""Bullets"" is stymied by its lack of an original score, although the lyrics have been thoroughly subjugated to its comedic purpose, wittily so. The use of standards was not such a problem on film, since part of Allen's cinematic gestalt was to forge a gauzy comic tribute to a golden age of Broadway.

Sinclair, portrayed by the wonderfully self-assured Marin Mazzie, is one of the reasons to see Bullets Over Broadway, the new musical birthed by Woody Allen from his 1994 movie of the same title. The Broadway show makes a Sinclair-sized effort to persuade us of the value of early-20th-century songs shoehorned into a 1929 setting.

She has staged a truly deliciously vulgar scene sung to ""The Hot Dog Song"" that, let's put it bluntly, will not be making the Tony telecast. She has teamed up with Santo Loquasto's ambitious and lovely set designs to put a snazzy looking real car onstage and yet also make a train out of dancers dressed as red caps in white gloves. When she has mobsters in three-piece suits tap dance to ""'Tain't Nobody's Biz-ness If I Do,"" their masculine movements are a joy. When the play-within-the-musical is staged, the proscenium has real dancers posing like carved statues. It's all been so well thought out and executed, right down to its bouncy chairs and rotating houses. Stroman has the right to sing, as the title of one song goes ""Gee Baby, Ain't I Good to You.""

Director-choreographer Susan Stroman is back in idea-crazy form in Allen's adaptation of his 1994 backstage-Broadway movie about gangsters and tootsies and self-serious thespians in the '20s. The show takes a while to hit its stride, feeling competent but mechanical at first, as if the job could only get done if everyone bellows and hard-sells the lamest jokes.

Even when the jokes fall flat and the songs (all borrowed from the period, many revamped by Glen Kelly) seem incongruous, the show has the galloping vigor of a runaway hit, if few of the ecstatic peaks...Stroman's staging moves with an effervescent fluidity - gangsters and flappers glide by, each in high Cotton Club style - yet the book isn't as spry.

Sex talk that came across with a shrug and a glint resurfaces as a broad neon leer.

So why does this musical, adapted by Woody Allen from his irresistible 1994 screen comedy about the tortured path of the artist, wind up shooting blanks? Flat where it should be frothy, the show is a watered-down champagne cocktail that too seldom gets beyond its recycled jokes and second-hand characterizations to assert an exciting new identity.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/10/2014
Bullets Over Broadway,5,Woody Allen’s “Bullets Over Broadway” Opens at NYC’s St. James Theatre,"The cardinal sin in adapting a Woody Allen film comedy for the stage is forcing the funny. So the creators of ""Bullets Over Broadway the Musical,"" the sledgehammering act of period-tune-driven desperation that opened Thursday night at the St. James Theatre, have a whole lot to answer for. The sinners include Allen himself... and Susan Stroman, the Tony-winning director-choreographer (""The Producers"") who amps up the material in uncomfortably vulgar fashion. (Yard-long phallus, anyone, for ""The Hot Dog Song?"") Except for the heretofore unheralded Nick Cordero, who plays Cheech, the goodfella with the soul of Euripides, no one emerges with a feather in their fedora. Not the hard-working Zach Braff, mugging his way through the ill-fitting role of handwringing nebbish; not the cartoonish Helene Yorke, overplaying the stock-variety floozy; not even the musical veteran Marin Mazzie, in a scenery-chewing turn as an operatically needy stage diva...",Washington Post,Peter Marks,04/10/2014
Bullets Over Broadway,5,'Bullets Over Broadway' is mildly entertaining but not a blockbuster,"In an ideal universe, the new musical ""Bullets Over Broadway,"" based on the 1994 Woody Allen film, would shut down for a few months so that a talented songwriter - perhaps David Yazbek (""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" or the young team of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (""A Christmas Story"") - could pen an original score for it. To its credit, ""Bullets Over Broadway"" is mildly entertaining...Although the show contains flashy design elements, amusing one-liners and generally decent performances, the decision to use jazz standards from the 1920s and 1930s instead of an original, well-integrated score proves to be absolutely fatal. By pigeonholing these familiar tunes into the existing plot, they arrive randomly and have almost nothing to do with the characters or plot...Zach Braff works too hard at portraying the stressed-out playwright. His singing voice is pretty thin as well. On the other hand, Marin Mazzie is ideally cast as the grandly theatrical Sinclair, and Vincent Pastore of ""The Sopranos"" is effortlessly effective as Valenti.",amNY,Matt Windman,04/10/2014

He gets a worthy foil and love interest in aspiring reporter Katherine (charming newcomer Kara Lindsay), one of several smart additions to the film's story by playwright Harvey Fierstein.

Here, Ost has created three massive rolling steel towers that get a workout as they twist and turn to resemble various cityscapes, often nicely paired with Sven Ortel's projections. ""Newsies"" will likely now go from Broadway to high school auditoriums across the country. Part history lesson, part fable and part love story, it's practically got its bags packed.

Jeremy Jordan, who made his first impression this season in the short-lived ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" is the heart -- even the heartthrob -- of the action as Jack Kelly, leader of the homeless urchins.

And dance. The choreography by Christopher Gattelli is dazzling. The acrobatic moves – leaps and kicks, back flips and mid-air somersaults – put “Newsies” up there with “Memphis” and “Anything Goes” for the most thrilling dancing currently on Broadway. Why they’re dancing is not always clear. At several moments in “Newsies,” I found myself asking: What exactly does this chorus line have to do with the plot?

The neon-and-graffiti mean streets of South Philly are portrayed with grim verisimilitude, but the glitz starts to fly as the climactic fight scene draws nearer, and the fight itself is a total-immersion, spare-no-expense stage spectacle. Since Steven Hoggett and Kelly Devine are jointly credited with the show's choreography, I assume that they deserve much credit for the potency of this scene, which is a rich and masterly synthesis of movement, music and design.

Not necessary. Any doubts about how well the story translates into a musical are dispelled in the opening minutes.

""Rocky,"" the massive theatrical spectacle that opened Thursday night at the Winter Garden Theatre, certainly is a broadly realized story told with bold punches and too much nonperiod video, and it has a reflective, low-key score that reaches too often for songs of nervousness, or of past regret, when it should also convey the red blood that courses through a fighter's veins.

Rocky,7,Swinging at Fighters and Serenading Turtles,"The creators of ""Rocky"" the musical - which features a book by Thomas Meehan and Mr. Stallone, and songs by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, with Alex Timbers as the director - have perhaps gone overboard in capitalizing on this legend. For what they have given us is a show that at first feels like such a flat liner that you can't imagine that it could pull itself into any kind of competitive shape, even in a lackluster season for Broadway musicals. The doubts that plague and paralyze its title character (the appealing, deliberately underwhelming Andy Karl) seem to have informed the show as well. The governing sensibility isn't just underdog; it's hangdog...Every tool at the disposal of the creative team (and probably much of the show's budget) is brought into play now for an all-out, multimedia assault on the senses that forces much of the audience to its feet. And I won't say more, because why should I spoil the one real pleasure this show provides? The fight, for the record, lasts 16 minutes. With front orchestra tickets costing $143 (and you'll want to sit close), that comes to about $9 per heart-racing minute. Such is the price of excitement on Broadway these days.

Of course, having an indestructible story with underdog characters worth rooting for doesn't hurt either...The ace up the show's sleeve, however, is...talented lead Andy Karl, who sticks close enough to the Stallone model in his characterization as Rocky Balboa while at the same time injecting fresh vitality and humor into the role...The delicate chemistry between Karl and Seibert breathes warmth into their outsider romance, and Adrian's solos, the melancholy ""Raining"" and ""I'm Done,"" in which she finally asserts herself and stands up to overbearing Paulie, are among the better numbers.

Rocky,7,‘Rocky’ Theater Review: Sylvester Stallone's Boxer Comes Out Swinging and Singing,"It's never a good sign in a stage musical when the most rousing numbers are not written by the credited songwriters, in this case Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens for their Broadway version of ""Rocky,"" which opened Thursday at the Winter Garden...Stallone and Meehan are faithful to that script, and on stage the dialogue plays even weaker than on screen. The corny jokes and meet-cute lines don't land or define character; they just sit there surrounded by dead air. Flaherty and Ahrens have merely punctuated that lame dialogue with their songs - or other people's songs...The show's Rocky is a bright spot in the production. Andy Karl has been in and out of a lot of Broadway shows, often as a replacement. Unlike Stallone's performance, there's nothing sentimental about Karl's Rocky, except the dialogue he's been stuck with.

We're watching a simulated fight lifted from a fictional movie but played inside an ornate Broadway theater. Which begs the question why this material screamed out to be a musical in the first place. The gritty, bloody world of 1970s boxing is not a natural fit for bursting into song - as some very awkward early moments in a gym here will attest. The creators seem to have acknowledged this tension and just abandoned the whole musical part.

Rocky,6,"Rocky, Winter Garden Theatre, New York – review","This new musical version of Rocky premiered last year in Germany, an appropriate choice: the 1976 movie and its five sequels are their own kind of Ring cycle. And that is, in fact, the key word here, as the main reason to see this spectacle is the stately Act Two emergence, from the proscenium into the audience, of a boxing ring. What precedes that coup is, in Broadway terms, an unexpectedly intimate affair -- a well-acted, occasionally dull and sometimes touching story of two wounded souls: Rocky Balboa, a piddling club fighter, and Adrian, a bespectacled clerk at a pet store...it becomes apparent that the musical Rocky subscribes to the method of Mamma Mia!...for ensuring a hit: wallop the audience for the final 15 minutes.

Rocky,5,Theater Review: Why Rocky Doesn’t Fly Now,"Take the score, by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, who (as Ragtimedemonstrated) know their way around iconic Americana. They work very carefully here, slowly developing a general musical atmosphere with shards of sung dialogue before allowing the emergence of a straight-up song. But, boy, do you feel the work. Ahrens, scrambling for hooks that won't sound musical theaterish and twee, has actually found some, but they come at the cost of a certain outlandishness, like Rocky's introductory solo ""My Nose Ain't Broken."" Similarly, Flaherty has identified a reasonable sound for the gritty story: guitar-heavy, with throbbing-headache bass, and bright chrome-on-a-used-car flugelhorning as suggested by Bill Conti's original movie scores...But within that compelling sound Flaherty mostly fails to make compelling songs...But because garage-band writing, however apt for the material, doesn't develop but rather repeats in torpid cells, the songs don't lift: they barely even move. Instead, the set does.",Vulture,Jesse Green,03/13/2014
Rocky,4,Theater review: 'Rocky',"The flow is also disrupted by all the new ballads, which attempt to psychologically probe Rocky and his girlfriend Adrian but end up being poorly integrated, musically weak and unintentionally ridiculous. Rocky, being an inarticulate individual, was not meant to burst into song. Hokey one-liners are also loaded into the script...While Andy Karl deserves credit for enduring so much physically as Rocky, he comes off as too clean cut to be credible in the role. As Adrian, Margo Seibert is stymied by her character being so undeveloped and makes little impression. In effect, ""Rocky"" is the new ""Spider-Man,"" a similarly flashy and misconceived spectacle-musical that exists mainly to showcase an elaborate fight sequence as its finale.",amNY,Matt Windman,03/13/2014
Violet,10,BWW Reviews: VIOLET is an Underappreciated Musical Gem,"While there are no miracles of biblical proportions, Violet ends with emotional cleansing, self-realization and hopefulness...Sutton Foster is that rare above-the-title Broadway star who can match polished musical theatre craft with an approachable everywoman quality. As Violet, she mixes her character's devout trust in the Lord with a protective shell of distrust built from twelve years of blaming her dad for both her initial injury and how he handled its aftermath and from dealing with the repulsed and cruel treatment she's received from others for half her life. It was the best acting performance of her New York career...Violet is a small musical of big ideas. Its spectacle comes in its writing and in the opportunity for singing actors to play intriguing characters. This production is not to be missed.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,04/20/2014
Violet,10,'Violet' a Vision of Beauty,"Everything about ""Violet"" is extraordinary, from its captivating, character-driven storytelling and pulsating country-rock score to the focused direction from Leigh Silverman and pitch-perfect casting. Sutton Foster, a two-time Tony winner, gives her most expressive, deeply felt and vibrant performance to date, fully capturing the character's yearning and volatility. It ought to be required viewing for all aspiring stage actors. She is joined by the similarly excellent Joshua Henry, Colin Donnell, Alexander Gemignani, Annie Golden and Ben Davis.",amNY,Matt Windman,04/20/2014
Violet,9,STAGE REVIEW Violet,"As musicals go, the story couldn't be simpler. Yet the material couldn't be richer...As Violet travels from the Blue Ridge Mountains to Memphis to Tulsa, the music moves from warm, soul-stirring folk-the bulk and heart of the score-to smoky R&B and blues to full-throated gospel and back again. It's impossible not to get swept up by rousing numbers...And, more important, you'll have to imagine Violet's facial scar, the result of an ax blade swung accidentally by her father when she was a girl; Foster's face remains unblemished. Of course, from the start, you know she's on a fool's journey. But you'll never regret taking the ride.",Entertainment Weekly,Entertainment Weekly,04/20/2014
Violet,9,Violet: Theater Review,"Broad strokes and big effects often appear to be the default setting for Broadway musicals, so it's always refreshing to see a modestly scaled show in which the cast and creative team trust in the value of emotional intimacy. Driven by a performance of incandescent yearning fromSutton Foster that's all the more moving for its restraint, Violet is a delicate wildflower, craning toward the sun...While the story could be treacly sentiment in less skilled hands, Violet brings a quiet spiritual undertow to its characters' search for fortifying connections. It's emotionally satisfying without being manipulative. Even the heroine's inevitably deflating encounter with the televangelist is handled with a delicate touch, becoming less about religious hucksterism than faith of a more human nature.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/20/2014
Violet,9,"Theater Review: In Violet, an Unlovely Accident Yields a Lovely Musical","But when it sings, Violet obviates such concerns. I don't mean just when it melodizes. Crawley's dialogue is as pungent and musical as his lyrics. And in Sutton Foster he and Tesori have found the ideal star. Foster has never been a vain actress, but here she seems to relish the opportunity to strip away everything inessential. (She has one costume, and it ain't pretty.) All spunk erased from her delivery, she's riveting in her portrayal of a woman who, despite everything, is ready to learn, from a black friend, about the thinness of skin. That's a very American story, in contrast, say, to The Cripple of Inishmaan, in which the title character's deformity particularizes the universal and irreversible ugliness of humanity. We're never even shown Violet's disfigurement - which, by the end, is the only thing wrong with her.",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/20/2014
Violet,9,Aisle View: Sutton's Violet Triumphs,"If Foster is exceptional in the title role, she is strongly supported by Henry, Donnell and especially the teen-aged Steele. Director Leigh Silverman (Chinglish) enhances her Encores work, taking the show's built-in production concept--a bus consisting solely of chairs, the heroine's disfiguring deformity suggested only by the facial reactions of the other actors--and using them to great advantage. The nine-piece band and the strong chorus are firmly led by music director Michael Rafter, who has a long history with both Foster and Tesori.",Huffington Post,Steven Suskin,04/20/2014
Violet,8,"‘Violet,’ theater review","[Foster] sings, 'I am on my way.' Buckle your seatbelts, folks. So are you. And what a wonderful trip it is...Songs by composer Jeanine Tesori and lyricist Brian Crawley add dimensions and textures, too. Summoning country-fried rhythms, gospel glory, bittersweet ballads and tender lullabies, the score is a rich and beautiful thing. Well-integrated too. Numbers make perfect sense and fuel characters and the plot like high-test gasoline...This journey unfolds a half-century ago, but you don't have to look far to see that the idea that life can change dramatically and devastatingly in a flash. What you do next becomes the question - and it makes this Violet evergreen.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,04/20/2014
Violet,8,Sutton Foster shows different shades in 'Violet',"Violethas the intimate feel of a chamber piece, so the vast space here doesn't seem like an ideal setting. Crawley's sensitive dialogue can drag at times - as can Tesori's rootsy score, which veers from country-flavored ballads to R&B and gospel-tinged production numbers. But Silverman and her cast reward our patience with performances that transcend clichés, taking care to make the fragility of these characters, and their different quests for dignity and love, authentic...The leading lady, not surprisingly, meets the challenges posed by her role - which proves a nice showcase for the folkier, more nuanced quality Foster's singing can take on when she's not belting to the back rows. Not that you'll have any problem hearing her here, or appreciating the courage and passion she brings to her latest star turn.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,04/20/2014
Violet,8,Longing for a Facial Scar to Simply Vanish,"If the time has come for Ms. Foster to take her place among the first rank of Broadway musical theater performers (fittingly in a season uncommonly rich in fine work from women), the moment also seems ripe for Violet, originally produced Off Broadway in 1997, to be acknowledged as an enduringly rewarding musical...But the musical concludes on a satisfying but not too sugary note of uplift. By shedding her illusions, at however painful a cost, Violet has also found a new kind of faith: a belief that her life's promise does not depend on divine intervention but the homelier comforts of human attachments.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,04/20/2014
Violet,8,‘Violet’ Theater Review: Sutton Foster Headlines Broadway's Latest Cinderella Story,"Since every other song is geared to bring down the house, it's a surprise the American Airlines Theatre still stands. Several spare but lovely melodies continue to run through Tesori's music; one thing that the original Violet had going for it was simplicity, and the composer didn't overreach with a big Rosa's Turn the way she did with the eleven o'clock numbers in her subsequent shows Caroline, or Change and Fun Home. Some of that unadorned lyrical beauty remains in Violet's ballads, nicely sung by Sutton Foster. She succeeds in not competing with the showbiz brashness surrounding her, although the actress's signature can-do spunk doesn't always jibe with Violet's self-image. Perhaps that little inconsistency doesn't matter. The generic hillbilly twang that everyone sports is just make believe. Give these country folks a song, and they can't help but turn into Broadway babies.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,04/20/2014
Violet,8,Review: B'way's 'Violet' Shows Beauty in Its Score,"Some musicals are big and brassy, calling out for attention with their razzle-dazzle and sassy sets. Others are more demure, letting their simple beauty shine. How appropriate then that a show about inner loveliness chose the latter path...Violet is a reminder - if we have already forgotten the power of Once - that a Broadway musical has to hit your heart as much as be visually pretty. A recent preview of Violet left some in the audience crying and smiling. And that's with a show that has actors simply bumping up and down on chairs to recreate a bus trip...It's not too hard to figure out that a show about a woman who thinks she's repulsive will ultimately deal with issues of beauty and the nature of love. It does, but it also explores guilt and belief, proving there's a lot you can do when you have great songs, wonderful singers and keep it simple.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,04/20/2014
Violet,8,Review: Sutton Foster Reinvents Herself in “Violet”,"Those expecting to see Sutton Foster belting and tap-dancing her way through her latest Broadway leading-role should be warned: the 39-year-old actress, who won Tonys for her turns in Thoroughly Modern Millie and Anything Goes, provides a restrained, intricate performance in Violet, the Jeanine Tesori-Brian Crawley musical now open at the American Airlines Theatre...It's hard to believe Violet was Testori's first musical, as her score is rich with complex melodies and delicate themes. A blend of country, gospel, blues and bluegrass, Tesori's music pay tribute to the best of the American roots. Crawley's lyrics are pure poetry, utilizing the plain-spoken language of the time to create beautiful illustrations of the difference between perception and reality...For Broadway, book writer Crawley has cut Violet from a two-act play into a one-act. At nearly two hours without intermission, Foster never leaves the stage. This is Violet's story, and Violet wouldn't dare let anyone else tell it. Which is good, because you'll fall in love with Foster so wholeheartedly, you won't want her to leave anytime soon.",NBC New York,Dave Quinn,04/20/2014
Violet,8,Violet,"It took 17 years, but Jeanine Tesori's beloved musical about a woman with a facial deformity journeying through the 1960s South has made it to Broadway...In expanding Betts's story, Crawley freights these relationships with more weight than his writing supports, and small moments of exaggeration (in the writing and staging) interfere with the piece's mood. But Tesori's music is a savory stew of American roots, stirringly sung by a cast that includes Emerson Steele as a younger Violet and Rema Webb as a gospel soloist. Though flawed on its face, Violet provides-as Flick sings in the show's best song-reason to rejoice.",Time Out NY,Adam Feldman,04/20/2014
Violet,7,'Violet' review: Sutton Foster in glorious musical,"So here it finally is, 17 years later and officially considered a revival, in a taut, vibrant, dirt-kicking show directed with exuberance and minimal fuss by Leigh Silverman...Colin Donnell plays the hunk, surprised to find himself drawn to her. Joshua Henry portrays the black man, the first Violet ever knew, who sings that he wants her to 'see me the way I see you'...In the middle of it all is Foster's Violet, with lank hair and lanky limbs and a glorious voice that cuts through complicated emotions without ever belting. She embodies both Violet's defensive armor and the childlike trust in a miracle that will give her 'Gene Tierney's eyes and Ava Gardner's eyebrows'...Yes, this is an ugly-duckling Cinderella tale about beauty being skin deep. But it is filled with unexpected details, compassion for its quirky characters and, especially, a rigorous score that reaches its own destinations through gospel, bluegrass and heart-aching anthems to tentative hopes.",Newsday,Linda Winer,04/20/2014
Violet,6,"'Violet' exits the bus, then loses its way","Much of 'Violet' takes places on a bus, which lends itself to a minimalist staging with just a few chairs. The flashbacks should be simple, too. But once Violet and her GIs exit the bus, this production (which is designed by David Zinn) can't decide how (or whether) to build on its initial, simple style. The set expands and contracts. Some of the onstage musicians don robes and join a gospel choir. But you never really feel the pull of place, or of a lost time, nor the comforts of a well-defined imagined world. Foster throws herself into this unglamorous role, her face pale and her body propelled into a world of no self-confidence. It is a very honorable performance, filled with craft. Foster never condescends, and she clearly enjoys her character's intelligence, although she, too, struggles toward the end with the need for climax and consequence.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/20/2014

But the other star of the show is helmer Anna D. Shapiro, who turns in an impeccably mounted production without a single blemish. The ensemble acting is flawless. The design work is breathtaking.

O'Dowd...makes a convincing, full-bodied transformation into the innocently excited, gentle giant Lennie...Franco, a regular presence on film, in the tabloids and even academia, acquits himself very well as George, stressing the character's introspective nature, frustration in trying to protect Lennie from the outside world and the loneliness and guilt that leads him to take on the challenging role of his protector.",amNY,Matt Windman,04/16/2014
Of Mice and Men,9,Of Mice and Men: Theater Review,"The headline news in this stirring Broadway remount is the stage debut of peripatetic artistic adventurer James Franco, starring opposite the wonderful Chris O'Dowd as itinerant ranch workers George and Lennie. But the real satisfaction comes from those unforgettable characters, their joy and wrenching sorrow, and the enduring power of their story of friendship sustained by illusory dreams in a world of solitude...If he's not quite a natural onstage, registering as an actor more accustomed to transmitting nuances of feeling to a camera, [Franco] brings warmth and understated manliness to George in a performance that grows more assured as the play progresses. Most crucially, Franco has beautiful chemistry with O'Dowd...Irish actor O'Dowd is tremendous in a part that could easily stray into mawkish territory.

But the real news is that Franco is just one fine element in this straightforward powerhouse of a revival, directed by Anna D. Shapiro with inspiring trust in the impact of classic storytelling...Franco has an easygoing presence and a dark, cranky, cowboy voice and, except perhaps for overly manicured facial hair, never suggests he might be smarter or hipper than his character. O'Dowd's Lennie is a big, childlike mouth-breather whose deliberate speech contrasts touchingly with his delicate fingers, which appear to dance -- at times too heavily -- with a mind of their own...No matter how well we know the story, it is hard not to hope that, just maybe, things will turn out better this time.

When Lennie is excited or curious, the fingers on his left hand curl, as if grasping for information he cannot comprehend; when he's afraid, or ashamed, he flinches, like a child being scolded. It's a vivid, sensitive performance of the piece with director Anna D.

O'Dowd gives an endearing interpretation of a mentally addled man who wants nothing more than ""to live off the fat of the land."" Franco, the performer-director-writer-teacher -- geez, he's such a multitasker that he even appears in a Gucci ad on the back of the Playbill -- is such a cult object that I feared his presence would throw the characters out of equilibrium.

As a result, Franco, a better actor than his meta-shenanigans sometimes suggest, gets off to a shaky start...Later though, as George becomes more protective and unselfish, Franco not only aligns himself with the part but justifies his star casting.

All are writ and here played as fearful. Whether it's Jim Parrack as Slim, Ron Cephas Jones as Crooks, Joel Marsh Garland as Carlson, Jim Ortlieb as The Boss or Jim Norton as the elderly Candy, a heart-wrenching character who must suffer through the loss of his beloved old dog and immediately understand that they will be coming for him next, the valley on the stage of the aptly named Longacre Theatre is filled with small but beautifully crafted, and deftly cast, performances.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/16/2014

O'Dowd, who's well known to theatergoers in London and Dublin (he also guest-starred on HBO's ""Girls""), brings a surprisingly feminine grace to the mentally challenged Lennie, a quality that makes his shifts into violence all the more shocking. He's a big man on stage, but the real joy in this performance is watching his hands. The gestures are so delicate, as if his fingers can express what his tongue can't.

Franco? He's pretty good in his Broadway debut as George, but O'Dowd, in a tricky role, steals the show...O'Dowd, his hair shaved and sporting a bushy beard, beautifully conveys Lennie's innocence, his tics and his toddler-like frustrations.

Franco gives an easy, well-shaded performance, but it's O'Dowd who stuns with a harrowingly real Lennie. The role of a mentally disabled character can be either technically overdone or a wallow in bathos, but O'Dowd is superb -- watch his delicate hand fluttering and how he steals looks at the boss's flirty daughter-in-law (Leighton Meester).

As Lennie faithfully repeats and then immediately forgets George's instructions before they reach their latest ranch, O'Dowd neither patronises nor makes light of the character. His American accent is pretty good, too. O'Dowd slides more easily into Steinbeck's rhythm than Franco, who crackles with intensity in some scenes but who initially gives a strained, over-exerted performance.

This shouldn't be impossible...Yet somehow Ms. Shapiro's handsome, meticulously designed production (featuring impressive Walker Evans-evoking sets by Todd Rosenthal) feels about as fluid as a diorama in a history museum. And its two undeniably talented leading men, though known as quirky and adventurous screen stars, here wear their archetypes like armor...Lennie is a role that is pretty hard to get wrong, if the performer has the right physical dimensions. Mr. O'Dowd gives the expected gentle-giant performance, though he uses his left hand in surprisingly delicate gestures that bring affecting grace notes to Lennie's lumbering presence.

Shapiro's finely staged production is Chris O'Dowd (Bridesmaids) as George's mentally challenged travel companion, Lenny. The gifted comedic actor brings a studied and skillful physicality to Lenny, a gentle giant with a stubbly shaved head who's not aware of his own strength even as he compulsively touches soft things -- a scrap of velvet, a puppy, a young woman's neck. O'Dowd's riveting performance is a study in underdeveloped impulse control: He frequently reaches out his hand with crooked fingers, then just as quickly withdraws.

Except we don't see much of anything in Franco's inexpressive countenance. Poised handsomely in work clothes, he registers changes in his features barely perceptibly, as if he is waiting during the 15th take for the camera to pick up the facial nuances...O'Dowd is called on here to convey intellectual slowness in that big, conventionally physical way, with slurred speech and a slightly unfocused gaze.

Of Mice and Men,6,Review: 'Of Mice and Men' finds James Franco in CliffsNotes mode,"In playing George opposite Chris O'Dowd's lumbering, mentally challenged, bunny obsessed Lennie in Anna D. Shapiro's gleaming yet hollow production, Franco delivers a performance that is the equivalent of a term paper on John Steinbeck's 1937 novella written the night before it was due with help from a double-shot of energy drink. He's obviously an actor of wide-ranging intelligence, but his intellectualism doesn't serve him here. His acting -- unspontaneous, utterly devoid of reflexes and lacking the gremlin smirk of his best film work -- happens strictly from the neck up. Rather than inhabiting moments and making connections with his fellow performers, he plays a series of ideas, turning up the dial on impatience, anger and loneliness when required but remaining more or less disembodied from his circumstances...O'Dowd, making a worthier Broadway debut, submits himself more wholly to the task at hand.

Of Mice and Men,6,Theater review: 'Of Mice and Men',"Franco is not terrible; he's an intelligent actor. But his George reveals no shadings of feeling, or internal life. It's a performance that just evaporates. Only Norton, a canny veteran, manages to suggest the poignancy of his trapped character. When one of the other men in the bunkhouse takes Candy's old, deaf dog outside to euthanize her, Candy sits shaken and silent, waiting - along with everyone in the audience - for what seems like minutes, for the sound of the inevitable shot that will tell him the deed is done.

Holler If Ya Hear Me,6,Review: Tupac Shakur musical tests limits of rap,"The high-energy, deeply felt but ultimately overwrought production opened Thursday in a blaze of N-words at the Palace Theatre, proving both that rap deserves its moment to shine on a Broadway stage and that some 20 Shakur songs can somehow survive the transformation -- barely...Unlike other jukebox musicals, the songs in ""Holler If Ya Hear Me"" are rarely ever delivered in the style of the original artist. Instead, the show's creators test their elasticity by turning them into duets or group songs -- and one even gets a folky acoustic guitar treatment. The danger is that the urgent, free verse style of Shakur's very personal songs gets diffused, lightened and flattened...Either way, rap is firmly on Broadway, and that's something to celebrate.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,06/19/2014
Holler If Ya Hear Me,6,Holler if Ya Hear Me,"While there have been rap-rich musicals (In the Heights), the fusion of hip-hop and razzle-dazzle has been tricky at best, tacky at worst. The latest attempt is Holler if Ya Hear Me, a ghetto-not-so-fabulous repurposing of songs by Tupac Shakur (1971-96) for a ramshackle morality tale about revenge and second chances. Although songwriting purists will shrink and wince at Shakur's freewheeling meter and propensity to rhyme slant, the real crime against craft is Todd Kreidler's weak book...Director Kenny Leon has a surer hand with straight plays (such as his solid revival of A Raisin in the Sun), and the enterprise deserves respect for bringing Shakur's verbal pyrotechnics and political rage before a new audience.

Otherwise, this show keeps falling prey to almost every cliché that has made the jukebox musical such a maligned genre in the theater. It's not just that Todd Kreidler's book can't match the power of Shakur's stark and bracing poetry. Kreidler keeps subverting those lyrics with a storyline that makes a contradictory mess of its principal characters. ""Holler"" is not a travesty like the super-successful ""Mamma Mia!,"" where only the first line of every Abba song refers to the action at hand and the rest of the lyrics go on their merry, aimless way. But all too often, Shakur's lyrics only comment on the emotional content of the characters' lives. As with most jukebox musicals, the lyrics rarely further the action.

That's the gamble investors took on this musical treatment of works left behind by Tupac Shakur, the now-sainted rap artist who died at the age of 25 in a 1996 drive-by shooting.

The former rear orchestra section is now given over to a few uncaptioned exhibits on loan from the National Museum of Hip-Hop, including a baby-blue tracksuit apparently worn by someone, and a pair of Timberland boots customized with portraits of Mandela and Obama.

Any danger of his long-in-development Tupac Shakurbiopic being beaten to the punch by Holler If Ya Hear Me is quickly dispelled by the deflating experience of this well-intentioned but toothless Broadway rap musical. The show is not a biographical drama but a story of friendship and family, gun violence, racism and redemption in an inner-city black neighborhood, inspired by Shakur's lyrics and poetry. However, therein lies the problem.

So it's extremely disheartening to report that ""Holler If Ya Hear Me"" is a total mess and misfire. Perhaps it needed more time for development...Rather than focus on Shakur's short and tumultuous life, which would have provided some structure, ""Holler If Ya Hear Me"" integrates -- or at least attempts to integrate -- Tupac's songs into an aimless and confusing tale of gang violence in a generic urban landscape that is full of undeveloped characters.

When an American film crew arrives on the neighboring island ofInishmore, planning to document the locals, a few find fresh inspiration - among them ""Cripple Billy"" Claven, an orphaned teenager sheltered by two spinsters, who alternately coddle and belittle him, and shunned or ridiculed by pretty much everyone else.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,04/20/2014

It's more comfortably a comedy than, say, Beauty Queen. But as outrageously funny as it often is, the play aches with a subliminal sadness that stays with you. The fabrications and speculations that these characters spin, in the fine old tradition of wild Irish yarns, come from an awareness that life is short and dangerous and, perhaps worst of all, empty...This gorgeously realized production has the wisdom to let us laugh until it hurts.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,04/20/2014

He suddenly reverses their backstories or presents unseen sides to their personalities that upend what the audience thinks it knows...While Billy's coming of age is tinged with melodrama by McDonagh's fervid plotting, he and his fellow Inishmaan residents remain memorable and richly drawn, providing an evening of boisterous theatricality that overlays buried empathy for our shared human frailties.",Associated Press,Jennifer Farrar,04/20/2014

But from bizarre stage plays like The Lieutenant of Inishmore to a psychotic film like Seven Psychopaths, the scribe always tempers his killing wit with affection, and even sympathy for his victims. That's the way it works with The Cripple of Inishmaan...McDonagh's sly point here seems to be that Irish humor, so wickedly cutting and clever, doesn't always mean to inflict pain.

The work also has none of the political chill of his masterwork, The Pillowman.

For any movement around the stage, which includes climbing over walls in Christopher Oram's evocative turntable set, he must oblige that impediment...McDonough is responsible for some of the darker material to appear on the Rialto in recent years ('The Pillowman' et al), and 'Inishmaan' is considered a piece that shows he has 'a sentimental side.' The play ends on a note that will make you question whether that's true-we are reminded of life's fragility going out, as we were going in.

Any friends or relations? Forget it: these four are one another's world - perhaps even the world - and that's that.",Telegraph,Matt Wolf,04/06/2014
The Realistic Joneses,7,Death and dark humor in 'Realistic Joneses',"To some extent, Eno seems to be asking which of the Joneses is, in fact, realistic? Any of 'em? This is a play about confronting mortality for sure, which is what underscores the gobs of intellectual and linguistic stimulation that flows from the stage: Letts' Bob, for example, no longer sees the point of painting the house, given that it only has to be redone. That being what you do is no longer sufficient for him. Bob, for the record, has many more caustic zingers, even though the character barely has the energy to spit them out. Hall's John, meanwhile, keeps trying to talk risks of new enterprises and new ways to communicate (why not?), but he mostly flails. Of course. Death is a brick wall. But the play's emotional appeal - and this one, weird as it most surely is, has more of that than any Eno work to date - comes from its equal recognition of the stress of taking care of the ill, the dying, the declining, the angst-ridden...Gold clearly understands that Eno is a writer with heart and compassion (and a useful touch of insecurity).",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/06/2014
The Realistic Joneses,7,Theater Review: The Realistic Joneses Are All Talk,"Which pair of Joneses, if either, is the ""realistic"" one is not made clear, or even addressed, though a certain merging of identities in the Albee manner makes the question moot. This is not altogether unappealing. The jokes are funny, and when their content supports character development, as sometimes randomly happens, they even land quite nicely. The growing tension between Bob and John - a matter of peacock territoriality and something darker, it would seem - naturally finds expression in such conversational gambits...Eno brings a decided intellectual panache to the genre (as opposed to, say, Lisa D'Amour's more emotional Detroit) but I'm not sure that's an improvement if the aim is to produce meaning; it's like producing water by squeezing a hamperful of damp clothes. You might be able to do it, but is it worth the effort? So even though The Realistic Joneses is smart and witty and beautifully produced, it's not exactly enjoyable. As Groucho Marx, who knew from paraprosdokians, once said, 'I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/06/2014

Will Eno's ""The Realistic Joneses,"" which opened Sunday at the Lyceum Theatre and marks his overdue Broadway debut, isn't one of them, despite all the fine acting and writing talent on display. The drama feels overextended even before its four characters settle into a final, whimpering contemplation of life, mortality, the cosmos, eternity and that owl hooting in the woods nearby...It's quirky, but nothing ages faster than quirky when the playwright doesn't have a second act for his short one-act play.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,04/06/2014

Yet Sunday night, the Massachusetts native made his Broadway debut with ""The Realistic Joneses,"" a dark comedy that's fairly accessible - for Eno (we're not talking Neil Simon here) - but won't settle the debate.

At the center of a top-notch ensemble isBryan Cranston, portraying our 36th president with that memorable thick Texas drawl, a commanding presence, a quick mind and a ferocious temper. He is indeed a skilled conductor; ruthlessly political, bullying, foul-mouthed and often insensitive to those who show him the most loyalty, all for the cause of promoting the sweet harmony of civil rights with a minimal amount of rioting.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,03/06/2014

Although Johnson is not the exclusive focus of the play -- many passages focus on the strategizing among various black civil rights organizations -- Mr. Cranston's heat-generating performance galvanizes the production.

All The Way,8,Review: Bryan Cranston Superb in 'All the Way',"The Johnson who emerges at the Neil Simon Theatre is ferocious and vulgar, likely to grab you by your throat and toss off a disgusting joke or throw around four-letter words. In Bryan Cranston's hands, he's completely irascible - and one of the highlights of the Broadway season... Cranston, fresh off his triumph as a drug kingpin in ""Breaking Bad,"" shows what he can do in a Broadway debut, and it's astonishing... Watching Cranston bully, threaten, feel sorry for himself, compromise, bellow and turn the knife is a hoot, no matter which side of the aisle you sit. Like ""House of Cards,"" the play explores the ugly sausage of politics and the gulf between the public and private politician...The other real star here is director Bill Rauch, who keeps this jigsaw puzzle humming along. There are countless scenes and a staggering number of parts, and the action spills out into the aisles.

All The Way,8,'All the Way' review: Bryan Cranston a fascinating Lyndon B.

And yet, for all the villains and heroes and sprawling ideals in the play, which began at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival without Cranston, this feels like a fascinating one-man show in a high school history pamphlet...Through it all, Cranston's LBJ feels a bit like a caricature, but one that's compelling and fun to watch. And every time the president made a big point at a recent preview, the audience clapped as if the actor were a tenor singing a high C. We suspect the unflashy Walter White would not have approved.",Newsday,Linda Winer,03/06/2014
All The Way,8,Failed by His Administration,"Robert Schenkkan's ""All the Way"" is not LBJ's first stage appearance, but it's the first time that he's made it all the way to Broadway, and the presence of Bryan Cranston in the cast is the sole reason for his arrival here. New plays don't reach Broadway nowadays without a movie or television star, and Mr. Cranston, lately of ""Breaking Bad,"" is (at least for the moment) the latter. Far more important, he's also a totally assured stage performer who plays Johnson as a gangly, lapel-snatching wheedler in whom self-pity and rage are twisted together too tightly to rip apart. Yes, it's a caricature, and a garish one at that, but Mr. Cranston makes you believe in what you're seeing and hearing...Bill Rauch has staged ""All the Way"" with a fluid physical vitality that makes the script seem smoother than it is...As for Mr. Cranston, he's a knockout. May he return to Broadway soon-in a less earnest play.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,03/06/2014
All The Way,8,All the Way,"Bryan Cranston recently ended five seasons playing a good man surrounded by depraved criminals, drowning by inches in a cesspool of guilt, paranoia and homicidal rage. In other words, he was training to be President of the United States. As Lyndon B. Johnson, borne into the Oval Office on a wave of blood and hemmed in by enemies within and without his party, Cranston rules the boards with a vengeance, a latter-day Abe Lincoln who drops f-bombs and talks plenty about balls. The TV star's galvanic turn and the layered, polyphonic production around him take the dried facts of history and make them walk, talk and kick ass to victory...Director Bill Rauch keeps the action flowing through Schenkkan's lively use of direct address, split scenes, soliloquy and fourth-wall-breaking exhortation. This being a political potboiler, there's plenty of rousing rhetoric, and Cranston imbues his inspiring speeches and profane rants with a larger-than-life intensity that leaps off the page.

Bryan Cranston - three-time Emmy winner and everybody's favorite bad boy as the scholarly drug czar in ""Breaking Bad"" - owns the role of LBJ, cracking the politician's hard shell to expose the man's personal crisis of conscience.

All The Way,8,‘All the Way’ Theater Review: Bryan Cranston Brings His Wildly Funny LBJ to Broadway,"Cranston doesn't look or act much like the real LBJ (at least the one most of us saw on TV), and that's one of the more intriguing aspects of Bill Rauch's direction. Except for a dead-on Lady Bird Johnson (Betsy Aidem) and George Wallace (Rob Campbell), the cast avoids the Madame Tussauds approach to acting that has taken over biopics (and rarely fails to win actors their Oscars). Rauch keeps the focus on telling a complicated story as nimbly as possible, dispensing with the extreme makeup and mannerisms that would only get in the way as Brandon J.

Because Cranston, late of TV's habit-forming ""Breaking Bad,"" works like the dickens to convey in his cagey, short-fused, eternally prowling LBJ a strength of will that reveals what a political leader needs to get big things done. It's a darn good thing, too, for without him, the three-hour production, which opened Thursday night at Broadway's Neil Simon Theatre, might feel like something a little duller, along the lines of a talking textbook. Perhaps in the vast cavalcade of Washington events and personalities the play covers, there was not much room left for nuanced portraits. In any event, none of the personages filling out the story, from J. Edgar Hoover (Michael McKean) to George Wallace (Rob Campbell), from Ralph Abernathy (J.

The play charts Johnson's first year in office and the passing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, taking LBJ from ""accidental president"" (he took over after the killing of John F Kennedy) to elected man of the people, with meticulous fidelity.

All The Way,6,'All the Way': Theater review,"Hot off a prize-winning streak on ""Breaking Bad,"" Bryan Cranston drives this star vehicle covering LBJ's turbulent first year in the top job with an uncanny authority and confidence rare in first time Broadway performers. The actor is at the height of his power playing a commander-in-chief striving to harness his own. Cranston, who turns 58 Friday, is fiery, ferocious, scary and, quite often very funny as the President who struggles in 1964 to validate his ""accidental"" rise while also ensuring re-election. Getting the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is key to achieving both - but the clock is ticking and the ranks of opponents are growing...It's also longwinded as it checks off 1964 talking points - MLK's infidelity, FBI spying, three young men killed in Mississippi, Democratic National Convention gamesmanship and more.

But the air often feels filled with the dry dust of chalk erasers being batted together by a painstakingly instructive schoolteacher. This is a shame.

Set at a Catskills resort that caters to straight married fellows who secretly dress and act like women, the play delicately traverses a midcentury American subculture at the time represented only in dirty jokes and horror movies. But if you want to know what impels these men to externalize their feminine sides, the play has difficulty peeling away more than a layer or two-it's more about gussying up than stripping bare.",Time Out NY,David Cote,04/22/2014
Casa Valentina,8,Casa Valentina: Theater Review,"Joe Mantello's impeccable production and a cast of outstanding actors make this an engrossing portrait of a marginalized group, but the strong set-up isn't matched by focused follow-through...A beloved Broadway fixture as well as a vocal LGBT rights activist, Fierstein is so perennially busy that it's surprising to realize how long it's been since his last new play...But just as out-of-town tryouts tend to be crucial in fine-tuning a musical, plays need thorough development too, and this one seems a workshop or two away from being fully realized. Which is disappointing, because there's no shortage of snappy comedy, tenderness, highly individualized character studies and thematic ambition here...Under Mantello's sensitive direction, the actors keep us invested in their characters, and there's certainly an inherent fascination in watching this unobserved pre-Stonewall subculture.

He has the benefit of a superb ensemble cast. Patrick Page and Mare Winningham have a poignant rapport as George/Valentina and his wife, Rita...Tom McGowan is an immensely endearing Bessie, one of several characters we only meet in their feminine guises, while Gabriel Ebert brings a goofy sweetness to the role of first-timer Jonathan/Miranda. Vets John Cullum and Larry Pine are predictably supple as, respectively, mother figure Terry and The Judge/Amy, who may harbor a dangerous secret.

Fierstein wants us to understand the vast spectrum of gender and sexuality. Along the way, bless him, he understands how to entertain.",Newsday,Linda Winer,04/23/2014
Casa Valentina,8,"Theater Review: A Fascinating, Somewhat Musty Look at Transvestism in Harvey Fierstein’s Casa Valentina","But even within the new play's sampling of seven cross-dressers, the meaning of the act varies widely. For some it's a hobby, for some a sexual fetish, for some a substitute for the worse sin of gayness, and for some an expression of deep allegiance to the feminine side of their soul. For most, regardless, it's also a jumble...In any case, the way these motives come together, or don't, to advance the cause of liberation for ""self-made women"" is the subject of this fascinating if somewhat musty play...Luckily, Joe Mantello's disciplined direction pulls the script swiftly past its punch lines and sops up some of its sentimentality as well. The design and the cast (which also includes John Cullum, Larry Pine, Nick Westrate, and Lisa Emery) are up to the Manhattan Theatre Club's usual high standards. Still, none of these fine attributes can quite disguise the odor of over-ingratiation that clings to Casa Valentina like day-old Prince Matchabelli.",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/23/2014
Casa Valentina,8,STAGE REVIEW Casa Valentina (2014),"A quasi-witchhunt follows, setting a violent and sobering climax in motion. In a play full of proud fakeries, the story hits the loudest false note. Fierstein's explosive resolution feels rushed and less authentic to the characters than the Donna Reed wigs on their heads. Still, the most lasting impressions of Casa Valentina are good ones: Fierstein's meticulous dialogue, Joe Mantello's smooth and confident direction, the cast's flawless performances. And if the characters teach us anything, it's that confidence and charm can cover a multitude of imperfections. B+",Entertainment Weekly,Adam Markowitz,04/23/2014
Casa Valentina,8,‘Casa Valentina’ cross-dresses and impresses,"The show, tightly directed by Joe Mantello, cruises through its first act, where Fierstein neatly balances pathos, killer one-liners -- ""I'm so pretty I should be set to music"" -- and a battle of ideas after Charlotte reveals her agenda. Things bog down after intermission, when there are one too many earnest speeches and saintly Rita admits to an unease with her marriage. Still, the entire cast is a delight, making us empathize with the characters' plights, dreams and journeys. And it's especially fun to watch Birney -- a specialist of milquetoast characters -- play a villainess with a messiah complex. Paradise may be lost by the end, but it's quite a ride to see it go down.",NY Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,04/23/2014
Casa Valentina,8,First Nighter: Harvey Fierstein's Highly Accomplished 'Casa Valentina',"It's possible to leave Casa Valentina believing that drag for straight men -- as is drag for homosexual men and women in Hedwig and the Angry Inch -- is an ultimately imprisoning mental state. Yet, I have a psychotherapist acquaintance who maintains that some men who dress as women do so because they're so smitten with women, so enamored of their wives in many instances, that they want to find out what it feels like to be women. They're turned on by it -- as Albert/Bessie declares he is here. Fierstein might have made a point of getting around to that and to other psychological insights. That he hasn't hardly detracts from an amazing accomplishment and one that, as the Tony season ends, will be a strong contender for the coveted prize.",Huffington Post,David Finkle,04/23/2014
Casa Valentina,8,Fierstien's Casa is Not a Drag,"While the play is heart-felt and enjoyable, it doesn't feel quite finished, and it ends on a rash and depressing note.

And given his experience in drag performance, maybe he can even join the cast of a future production.",amNY,Matt Windman,04/23/2014
Casa Valentina,7,Broadway Review: Harvey Fierstein’s ‘Casa Valentina’,"The inspiration for Harvey Fierstein's ""Casa Valentina"" was a discreet sanctuary in the Catskills where manly men (with wives and children and other baggage) could get their kicks in the bottled-up postwar era of the 50s by dressing up like girly-girls. But the play doesn't venture much beyond the facade of its true-life model. Fierstein vividly captures a group of these brave pioneers with their girdles on, and a trim ensemble helmed by Joe Mantello lends them character. But the plot is messy, the action static, and attempts to probe the psychosexual dynamic of transvestism are tentative and superficial.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,04/23/2014
Casa Valentina,7,Theater review: 'Casa Valentina',"Under the direction of Joe Mantello, the play benefits from superb acting, with each male character creating a strongly individual, convincing female self. Westrate's tough Gloria, Birney's careerist Charlotte and Ebert's awkward Miranda are all particularly vivid. ""Casa Valentina"" is very uneven, with abrupt changes in mood, action and attitude. But its illumination of a neglected corner of human activity is diverting, and often thought-provoking.",Bergen Record,Robert Feldberg,04/23/2014
Casa Valentina,6,"‘Casa Valentina,’ theater review","With ""Torch Song Trilogy,"" ""La Cage aux Folles"" and ""Kinky Boots"" to his credit, playwright Harvey Fierstein knows a thing or three about the fluidity of gender, identity and sexuality -- and about men raiding women's closets.

Casa Valentina,6,‘Casa Valentina’ Theater Review: Harvey Fierstein Lifts the Skirts of Hetero Crossdressers,"In the Playbill, Fierstein tells us not to call his characters ""drag queens"" or ""female impersonators."" And that's not the end of his sermonizing...From ""La Cage aux Folles"" to ""Kinky Boots,"" Fierstein has created some very sympathetic hero-victims. With ""Casa Valentina,"" those victims are looking more pathetic than sympathetic. He's the master of the long, bigoted diatribe that helps make the audience feel superior but leaves the poor character who's the object of all this verbal abuse simply battered and abused. There's much more nuance in Joe Mantello's direction of his actors, although even he doesn't succeed in softening Fierstein's sledgehammer when, late in the play, a transvestite's daughter (Lisa Emery) arrives to tell off the owners of the Catskills resort.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,04/23/2014
Mothers and Sons,9,"Review: Tyne Daly Is Haunted by Her Son's Ghost in ""Mothers & Sons""","With ""Mothers & Sons,"" McNally has again crafted a narrative that could not be more particular to time (the present) and location (the progressive Upper West Side). This time, it's a story rooted in optimism, and one that manages to look simultaneously over its shoulder and straight ahead. Daly gives an exquisite performance as a lonely, suicidal woman desperate to imagine a life her son might have led...Together, Daly and Weller have dynamic chemistry, lurching from moments of mutual respect to moments of accusation, and back...I thought ""Mothers & Sons"" was fantastic, for how effectively it locks down this unique period of time that is 2014, in New York City, amid the explosive progress of the gay rights movement in the last handful of years. I hope it finds a broad audience. If you're under 30, ""Mothers & Sons"" is a history lesson; if you're older, it may feel like the sun on your face.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,03/24/2014
Mothers and Sons,8,'Mothers and Sons' a moving reflection on a changed gay America,"To a large extent, McNally is chronicling the revolutionary changes he has seen in the lives of gay Americans - and what playwright has more right to do so? McNally, 75, who got married in 2010, writes here with the moral authority of one who has chronicled this fast-moving history in real, dramatic time; had ""Mothers and Sons"" been the work of a different playwright, the way it feels in the theater would be entirely different. The persona of the writer counts for a great deal here, aesthetically, politically and otherwise. Broadway doesn't often feel like a community talking to itself about the immediate moment, but it does here. This is also an exceptionally timely play, a piece that puts great change into context and, in the Broadway world, also has the advantage of having gotten there before anyone else; same-sex marriage became legal in New York only in summer 2011.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,03/24/2014
Mothers and Sons,8,Paths That Crossed Cross Again,"""Mothers and Sons,"" which opened on Monday night at the John Golden Theater in an impeccably acted production directed by Sheryl Kaller, is wrapped in a sense of urgency that paradoxically saps it as a drama. It wears its significance defiantly and a bit stiffly, rather as Ms. Daly's character, a Dallas matron visiting Manhattan, wears the big, blocky fur coat in which we first see her...It is, in essence, a debate play with fraught emotional underpinnings, and it doesn't avoid the stasis of that genre. It also tends to sabotage its potential to move us by making the debate, rather than psychological credibility, its first priority...The performers are skilled enough that we don't hear the sound of gears stripping. But they can't entirely justify their emotional U-turns, nor keep at bay our sense that we are following a menu of subjects that must be covered before the evening's end.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,03/24/2014

The gentle and moving ""Mothers and Sons"" opened Monday at the Golden Theatre, where a celebrated revival of the searing AIDS drama ""The Normal Heart"" was staged in 2011. As a sign of how much has changed, McNally's play is being billed as the first time a legally married gay couple has been portrayed on Broadway...The 90-minute play moves quickly, and although some of the most angry exchanges seem to erupt from nowhere, the playwright beautifully shows how close to the surface long-suppressed emotions and slights can fester.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,03/24/2014

And, paradoxically, rule No. 1 is: Give nothing away. As Katharine Gerard in Mothers and Sons, she doesn't clue you in to her intentions, or tease her next moves, or make big faces to indicate her anger at the world: an anger so unrelenting she could ""let that ottoman put me in a rage."" She resists crying and tells no jokes but jerks the most tears from the audience and gets the evening's biggest laughs just by standing or sitting and doing the plainest things.

But there she is on stage at the Golden Theatre, where Terrence McNally's ""Mothers and Sons"" opened Monday, now inhabited by Tyne Daly and acting every bit the human refrigerator that the late Sada Thompson presented in that 1990 episode titled ""Andre's Mother."" Did McNally bring Katharine back just to beat her up again? Maybe. Whatever, this public trashing is a riveting show. Of course, by play's end Katharine has delivered a couple of bombshells that explain her bitterness, if they don't exactly absolve her, and Daly gets some of the evening's biggest laughs without even saying a word.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,03/24/2014
Mothers and Sons,7,Broadway Review: ‘Mothers and Sons’,"Terrence McNally tries to cover a lot of territory in ""Mothers and Sons"": the relationships between mothers and their gay sons; the satisfactions of gay marriage; the dark, enduring legacy of AIDS; and the generation gap within the gay community. Lucky for this high-profile scribe, he has sensitive interpreters of these themes in thesps Frederick Weller and the ever-astonishing Tyne Daly.

For proof of the remark, look no further than Mothers and Sons, the sometimes absorbing, somewhat unsatisfying new play by Terrence McNally that has arrived on Broadway. Without Tyne Daly as Katharine Gerard, who has come to New York from Dallas to bring her dead son's diary to his former lover, the character -- and the 90-minute, interval-less play -- would have struggled to engage us from the first beat.",Financial Times,Brendan Lemon,03/24/2014
Mothers and Sons,6,Theater review: 'Mothers and Sons',"Directed by Sheryl Kaller, the play has a rather clumsy construction, with pretexts continuously popping up for characters to leave the room - they answer the front door, go to the bathroom, give Bud his bath - so that the remaining pair can have their private conversations.

Mothers and Sons,6,Mothers and Sons: Theater Review,"Tyne Daly is far too grounded and honest an actor to give an inauthentic performance, but she deserves a more satisfying play than Terrence McNally's Mothers and Sons. There's no shortage of thematic breadth here concerning the changing dynamics for gay men and their families, in a work that considers the generational shift from AIDS victims to survivors, from incomprehension to increased acceptance, and from rights-deprived relationships to legitimate marriage and parenthood. But while it's absorbing and at times mildly affecting, this shapeless drama never probes deep enough, its air of artificiality making it appear to have been rushed to Broadway with insufficient development.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,03/24/2014

Though dated at times, and shaded with passive aggression, this is arguably McNally's best play in 20 years...Sensitively directed by Sheryl Kaller, Mothers and Sons rarely lags as it unfurls in a single unbroken scene. And Daly's commanding performance helps check McNally's impulses toward pop sociology and reverse nostalgia. She has the strength and give of melting steel.",Time Out NY,Adam Feldman,03/24/2014

As she did in McNally's ""Master Class,"" Daly offers a masterful performance, delivering her lines with a dry acidity and firm poise while her reactions to both men reveal her conflicted emotions.

Mothers and Sons,3,No drama from this mama in ‘Mothers and Sons’,"A clunker of a Broadway show, ""Mothers and Sons"" asks us to endure the vacuous chit-chat of deeply unpleasant people. The worst part is, there isn't even a good reason for their chit-chatting in the first place. Fortunately, one of them is played by Tyne Daly, who gives the character of Katharine Gerard -- the embittered mother of a dead gay son -- the complexity and dignity playwright Terrence McNally refuses her...Under Sheryl Kaller's stilted direction, all three adults look uncomfortable, though at least Daly's character is meant to be that way. The actress suggests a world of pain, grief and anger behind the stoic, matronly facade, and she lands her zingers with ease.

The sweet ""Act One,"" which opened Thursday at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, faithfully and chronologically charts Hart's rise from poverty in the Bronx to co-writing with Kaufman ""Once In a Lifetime"" in 1930, his first Broadway hit. But it's of course more than that: The majority of the 22 actors play multiple parts, jumping in and out of characters and costumes while the bold, complex set by Beowulf Boritt spins and spins.

Act One,8,You’ve Got to Have Hart,"The result is a thrillingly well-staged play that runs for two hours and 40 minutes but feels much shorter. Not only is ""Act One"" light on its theatrical feet, but it has the open-hearted impact of a melodrama -- one that has the advantage of being true. Part of what makes ""Act One"" so potent is that Mr. Lapine disdains all irony in describing Mr. Hart's rise to fame.

Dozens of scenes, mostly the same length, paint pretty pictures of Hart's life...But this format of narration and illustration, enabled by Beowulf Boritt's gigantic revolving three-story set, is the opposite of dramatic; it's formal and repetitive like a pop-up book, about the last thing you want from Hart's you-go-kid story.

While the multitasking Shalhoub is given little to do as the older Moss and his father, he mines welcome humor out of his portrayal of the fastidious, soft-spoken George, even if too much of the performance is about the celebrated playwright's OCD neuroses.

But splitting the part creates unnecessary distractions, especially since Shalhoub also plays Hart's father and his co-writer. He's highly amusing as the kooky, nitpicking Kaufman, but this doesn't take us far.

The Bridges of Madison County,9,'The Bridges of Madison County' review: Weepy romance detours into conventional Broadway,"""The Bridges of Madison County"" is a ravishingly beautiful musical play based on the phenomenally popular 1992 weeper about a four-day love affair between an Iowa farm wife from Italy and a worldly photographer. In other words, this is unblushing Harlequin Romance-style material bound in top-quality leather. So many intelligent, gifted artists are involved in this adaptation that we wish the objective were deeper than a high-toned bodice ripper with comic-relief detours into conventional Broadway. But Kelli O'Hara and Steven Pasquale, magnificently magnetic as Francesca and Robert, make the ripping feel like real heartbreak.

She also confirms her position as one of the most exquisitely expressive stars in musical theater. Her Francesca, a questioning farmer's wife who briefly discovers a love with all the answers, brings a rich and varied topography to what might have been strictly flat corn country. True, the rest of the show, directed by Bartlett Sher with a script by Marsha Norman, isn't nearly as multidimensional. Though Ms. O'Hara has a lust-worthy leading man in Steven Pasquale, most of what surrounds her has the depth of a shiny picture postcard, one that bears a disproportionately long and repetitive message.

And second: Are we so starved for affection we're willing to give over our hearts to a story that is - sorry, folks! - utterly preposterous? Even after swooning over the book? And sighing over the movie? The answers: Indeed, Kelli O'Hara can do anything, darn near perfectly, including transform herself into a chestnut-haired Italian beauty who, for the better part of two decades, has assumed the role of an Iowa housewife.

But I must also admit that those same jaded eyes, by the end of the show, had misted up more than once; and judging from the waves of muffled sniffles around me, this was not an uncommon response. Marsha Norman and Jason Robert Brown's adaptation earns those tears. The musical's emotion is unapologetically grand, and its love story has a wide, old-fashioned scope.

The Bridges of Madison County,8,STAGE REVIEW 'The Bridges of Madison County',"It helps that Jason Robert Brown (Parade, The Last Five Years) has written a lush and deeply romantic score, filled with rich and melodic duets that show off its leads' terrific voices - their second act rafter-shaker 'One Second & a Million Miles' is destined to become a cabaret staple. The tunes help compensate for Marsha Norman's more problematic book, which stumbles whenever the spotlight isn't on Francesca and Robert. The story has no real villains, or even antagonists, to work up a plot worth sustaining for 2 hours and 45 minutes...Director Bartlett Sher does his best to fill the space in the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre. Ultimately, this is a chamber musical that is both introspective and modest at its core. But when O'Hara lets her guard down and opens herself up to the possibility of romance, and when her magnificent soprano belts out Brown's swooping melodies, even a small space can seem as wide and expansive as an Iowa cornfield.

Kelli O'Hara, who plays Francesca, is never better than when working from loss and confusion; her prettiness has always contained more than a hint of hurt, which gives her voice its richest colors...And barihunk Steven Pasquale, as Robert, who starred opposite O'Hara in Far From Heaven off Broadway last spring...at last gets a chance to be heard singing on Broadway.

And the stunningly gifted Kelli O'Hara should win her fifth Tony nomination with this role, the most finely tuned of her illustrious career, and she sings her heart out.

Parts of it are as musically exciting as anything heard on Broadway since Stephen Sondheim's glory days...But Mr. Brown is rather better at writing scenes than songs, and except for ""Another Life,"" a sweetly folk-flavored ballad sung in a flashback by Robert's ex-wife (Whitney Bashor), none of the songs in ""The Bridges of Madison County"" has a clear-cut, boldly shaped melodic profile-or, for that matter, a truly memorable lyric.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,02/20/2014

In Bridges of Madison County, when romance goes asunder and the sympathetic lovers are forced apart, we sit there stonefaced, with nary a wet eye in the house. At least, not where I was sitting.

Playwright Eric Coble presents the aging decay of the human mind and body as a necessary process replete with mordantly humorous and empathetic moments. He lightens the potentially depressing subject matter by providing plenty of comedic zingers to both Academy Award-winner Parsons -- here powerful and ingratiating -- and to her co-star, the equally skilled Stephen Spinella.

In Messing's funny, moving performance, we see how Anthony breaks through that armor - even though it's Rosemary who, in an intermittently awkward but endearing climax, determines to force Anthony out of his shell...Outside Mullingar's account of human connection is generally less provocative, and a lot more comforting.

Director Doug Hughes, also from Doubt, keeps the action moving smoothly between the four sets and sustains the mood over one hundred intermissionless minutes. Not the least of Outside Mullingar's delights is the rain-soaked scenery by John Lee Beatty, which provides its own magic in the final scene. Mullingar is admittedly not quite so imperishable and rarefied as Leenane or Inishmaan, no.

Outside Mullingar,6,Theatre review: 'Outside Mullingar' -- 2.5 stars,"While the play itself is meandering and uneventful, it opens up considerably in the heartwarming final scene where Anthony and Rosemary finally connect in spite of their hesitations and quirks. It serves as a hearty payoff after over an hour of straight boredom. Messing, who is making her Broadway debut, has noticeable difficulty handling an Irish accent but still manages to make her character sympathetic and endearing. Byrne, who originated the role of Father Flynn in ""Doubt,"" foregoes his charismatic intensity and makes for an unexpectedly cute and quirky counterpart to Messing.",amNY,Matt Windman,01/23/2014

On the packing list of required elements, no item is left unchecked. Irish-ish stars? Sure: The production is headed by Brían F. O'Byrne (born in County Cavan) and Debra Messing (hey, she's got red hair). Dank setting? John Lee Beatty's scenery looks like it was dredged from a peat bog. An old Hibernian air? Please join me in singing ""Wild Mountain Thyme."" Everything, including the kitchen sink, screams Ireland as we know it from plays great and small: the wellies, the crucifix, the rain, the mad stories, the fierce colleen, the crafty old man, the wake, the Guinness, the touch of the poet.

Somehow, as the way it is played here under Doug Hughes's direction, Anthony comes off as a violet to Rosemary's hornet. While many in the audience made it clear that they found this scene both hilarious and touching, others may applaud in relief at the Delayed Curtain.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,01/23/2014

Had he elected to stick with a character-based ""backstage"" story, as he does in the first scene, he might have had a winner this time...It's not just that the story, having jettisoned whatever was interesting about it, is so undeserving of the emotional extremes that surrealism at its best can illustrate. It's also that Simonson, emerging from the dream, has nothing left to pitch.

Bronx Bombers,4,Bronx Bombers,"If penning sports plays were a competition, Eric Simonson would be MVP. He's found drama in football coaching (Lombardi), basketball rivalry (Magic/Bird) and now, with Bronx Bombers, the national pastime. None of these qualify as great works, but for some theatergoers, they offer tantalizing glimpses into exotic subcultures...Bronx Bombers touches on high points of 20th-century Yankee history, although it hasn't been so much plotted as researched and pitched to guys who get a lump in the throat from seeing Lou Gehrig shake hands with Derek Jeter...Simonson, who directs his own script too laxly, touches on predictable tensions between individual excellence versus team spirit, but in terms of ideas or visual flair, there are no curves here.",Time Out NY,David Cote,02/06/2014

Lombardi focused on one man; Magic/Bird took on two. Here, he's dealing with a whole franchise. (What's next - a hockey play that puts the entire NHL on ice?) Worse, the manufactured plot doesn't even begin to approach believability... In his defense, Simonson doesn't have a heck of a lot to work with. There's no footage or photos - no visual backstory that could fill in the blanks for viewers who aren't completely steeped in 90-plus years of Yankee history. MLB should be able to supply more than a few pinstriped uniforms with the interlocking NY logo. Not that a few video clips would turn Bronx Bombers into a hit.

From the evidence of Simonson's play and Allen's movie, painters and writers make a helluva lot better dinner guests than baseball players. The premise isn't bad, but the around-the-table chat in ""Bombers"" is...After the endless dream sequence, Simonson takes us to the last game in the old Yankee Stadium. It's like he's directing the Passion Play what with all the dry ice foaming and church bells ringing and beatific light streaming. It's not unusual for screenwriters to direct their own scripts, but they're working in collaboration with a cinematographer and an editor.

Helmer Lyndsey Turner's stunning production creates an appropriately bleak environment for this dark drama, and Rebecca Hall (a member of British theatrical royalty better known for her movie work) makes a compelling case for this fragile creature.

Happily, the Roundabout, which has been steadily upgrading its ""classic"" offerings in terms of both choice and execution, gives it the top-drawer mounting it deserves. The director, Lyndsey Turner, making an exceptional U.S. debut, pulls off the neat trick of realizing a Big Idea without letting it consume the play.

You might say such a battle, pitting a lone specimen of humanity against a marvel of technology and artifice, only underscores the haunting determinism of ""Machinal,"" and I wouldn't argue.

The combined effect is dour but often darkly beautiful...This is a tough play with an intensity that doesn't let up, and the actors all respond to it with full-force commitment...But it's Hall who rivets attention, holding nothing back in her tortured portrayal of this everywoman's dehumanizing downward spiral as she's failed by her own survival skills and by everyone around her.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,01/16/2014

A Night With Janis Joplin,8,Review: Davies a Knockout in A NIGHT WITH JANIS JOPLIN,"The one hundred and ten year history of Broadway's Lyceum Theatre has seen nine musicals, a couple of plays with music and a few concert evenings grace its stage. But I doubt if the walls of the classic Beaux-Arts showplace have ever felt any vibrations like the powerful full-throated wails of soulful orgasmic psychodelia emoted from Mary Bridget Davies in the title role of A Night With Janis Joplin...Writer/director Randy Johnson's concert-style musical is not to be lumped in the same category with that trio of Beatles imitation concerts that have played Times Square or other such shows that rely solely on mimicry. The ambition is a little higher here, and while A Night With Janis Joplin has its flaws as drama, as a raucous, hyper-energized tribute to one of American music's great icons, it's a joyful explosion.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,10/10/2013
A Night With Janis Joplin,8,"Little Girl Blue Howls Again, but Talks Sensibly, Too","Ms. Davies portrays both sides of Janis, I should add. And while she bears a notable physical resemblance to Joplin, and her speaking voice has the same whisper of a twang and down-home earthiness, I'm a little suspicious of that second character. If the real Joplin had the kind of sensible perspective on her life and career that she exhibits in this show - happily reminiscing about her youthful love of painting, or giving a learned docent tour of blues history - she would probably not have died of an overdose of heroin and alcohol at 27...There remains a strange disjunction between the soul-baring singer and the woman calmly telling us that ""the blues is just a good woman feelin' bad,"" or ""the blues are a way out of where you are, and they can drag you to where you're going,"" or ""it's the want of something that gives you the blues, man.""

A Night With Janis Joplin,7,Theater Review: A Night With Janis Joplin Is a Cheap Thrill,"Don't expect much in the way of personal revelation or public misbehavior. Apart from sucking on a bottle of Southern Comfort, this Janis is quite composed and sedate between songs. She tells charming stories about housecleaning, her family, her favorite 45s. Johnson's script has been carefully policed by the Joplin estate, which consists of Janis's siblings-thus, it's long on stories about her siblings and short on just about everything else. If an alien landed in the theater, seeking knowledge of Janis Joplin, its report to the mother ship would describe a mild, genial hippie redneck whose onstage routine included the occasional nip of hooch-basically Ron White in combat boots and batik, with a song in his heart...Davies's Janis, it must be said, is nothing short of extraordinary in the pipes department: She shreds her larynx like a woman possessed and still has more to give. It's a close but not Xeroxed impression, and in the narrow interstices between impersonation and performance, she injects real feeling and nuance.

A Night With Janis Joplin,7,A Night With Janis Joplin Broadway Review,"""A Night With Janis Joplin"" is more or less a concert, with some patter in-between the songs that could be called monologues. In these, we learn that Janis's mother was a talented singer in Port Arthur, Texas who decided not to move to New York for a professional career, and thereafter listened incessantly to Broadway albums like West Side Story and My Fair Lady, whose songs Janis memorized. Janis herself at one point wanted to be a painter; her artwork appear behind her. She also read a lot as a child; her favorite was F. Scott Fitzgerald. And she loved the blues, a subject she tells us about with almost scholarly disquisition.",New York Theatre,Jonathan Mandell,10/10/2013

A Night With Janis Joplin,6,Broadway Review: ‘A Night With Janis Joplin’,"As a musical biography, ""A Night With Janis Joplin"" is pretty much a bust. The book by Randy Johnson, who also helmed, skims lightly over the singer's Texas childhood and her tenure with Big Brother and the Holding Company, with nary a word about her personal life or the booze and drugs that cut it short.

A Night With Janis Joplin,6,"A long, loud 'Night With Janis Joplin'","What the blues are, exactly, is a preoccupying concern in this musical tribute, which opened Thursday at Broadway's Lyceum Theatre. They can be, Joplin tells us at different points, ""a good woman feelin' bad,"" or ""the want of something,"" or occasionally ""the devil himself."" Speaking these lines, Mary Bridget Davies, who plays the late '60s rock goddess, is utterly credible as a hippie icon, from her alternately blissed-out and earnest vibe to her groovy period costumes (the latter provided by designer Amy Clark). Yet under the direction of Randy Johnson, who also wrote the book, Night offers a distinctly post-American Idol version of the blues. Davies is accompanied on stage by a band and four other spectacularly gifted female vocalists, who alternate as the backing ""Joplinaires"" and various artists whose work inspired Joplin's; and the fireworks they provide can border perilously on crowd-pleasing caricature.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,10/10/2013

A Night With Janis Joplin,6,STAGE REVIEW A Night With Janis Joplin,"It's a shame, then, that this musical doesn't give Davies much to work with other than her phenomenal voice. Written and directed by Randy Johnson, Night focuses on Joplin's musical icons - Bessie Smith (Taprena Michelle Augustine), Nina Simone (de'Adre Aziza), Etta James (Nikki Kimbrough), and Aretha Franklin (Allison Blackwell) - without revealing much about their influence beyond the fact that sheplayed that record until she wore it out, man. There's no trace of Joplin's juicy life - no gossip about what happened backstage at Woodstock or the Monterey Pop Festival, nothing about the night she allegedly broke a beer bottle over Jim Morrison's head, or her romance with Leonard Cohen, who later memorialized their relationship in the ballad 'Chelsea Hotel.' Instead, Johnson strings together broad clichés from her childhood memories, with Joplin's character insisting that women feel the blues more acutely than men, and that fans love blues singers more after they're dead. During one night of previews, an audience member audibly gasped 'Aww!' after the latter line, apparently unaware that Joplin died of a heroin overdose in 1970.",Entertainment Weekly,Melissa Maerz,10/10/2013

A Night With Janis Joplin,5,Theater review: 'A Night With Janis Joplin',"No one can accuse ""A Night With Janis Joplin"" of not delivering what it is promised in the title. Not unlike the recent Beatles tribute show ""Let It Be,"" this marks yet another faux concert in which a performer pretends to be a legendary rock star...But whereas ""Let It Be"" featured no acting of any sort, the very talented and dedicated Mary Bridget Davies really digs into the role of Joplin, authentically replicating the Queen of Rock's distinctively raw and raspy voice in every song while bringing an unrelenting intensity...It's easy to tell the Joplin fans, who stand up and cheer after she performs songs such as ""Piece of My Heart"" and ""Me and Bobby McGee,"" from everyone else. They'll be pleased. But what about those unfamiliar with Joplin, as well as those who never liked her in the first place?",amNY,Matt Windman,10/10/2013

But it also displays a genuine wit and musical flair that marks a refreshing change from the onslaught of overblown musicals permeating Broadway these days.

Truth to tell, it's pleasantly fluffy and not without charm, and were it playing in an off-Broadway house, it'd have a better chance of finding its natural audience, which I take to be hopeful millennials who bear the unhealed scars of the online dating wars...It helps, too, that Mr. Levi, a second-tier television star (""Chuck"") who is making his Broadway debut, turns out to be a strikingly adept stage comedian who knows how to put the right spin on a good joke, while Ms. Rodriguez is a spunky sasspot with grade-A pipes.",Wallstreet Journal,Terry Teachout,08/08/2013

So does Levi, though first he has to drag out a shameless dead mother story and he doesn't get an edgy song until about 85 minutes into the 90-minute show.

They do have a balls-out confidence when it comes to avoiding daintiness, and there's wit, warmth, and charm in sufficient abundance to keep us engaged for 90 minutes...The creative team's real achievement begins and ends with casting. It isn't so much that Levi and Rodriguez exceed the rather restricted types they're playing; it's how they keep making us forget that they're playing types.

Although his singing is merely adequate, Mr. Levi brings a vitality and off-kilter humor to his performance...Ms. Rodriguez has the drearier role - it's obvious that the show was written by three guys, since only the female characters are accessorized with flaws - but her singing is ardent and assured.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,08/08/2013

On the other hand, Austin Winsberg's sitcom-style dialogue lands few laughs. Levi...is sincere, but overplays the geekiness, while Rodriguez...manages to add signs of character depth.

Now, if I knew a less-than-precocious child of 10 or so, and had several hundred dollars to throw away, I would consider taking him or her to the new and improved ""Spider-Man.""",New York Times,Ben Brantley,06/14/2011
Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark,1,A Critic’s Final Word on Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,"Spider-Man — to beat my running metaphor into the ground and then leave it for dead — is like that good-and-crazy friend with a highly entertaining substance-abuse problem, the one who goes off and gets clean, and comes back a different and diminished person: With his manias and overmuchness reined in, you suddenly realize how very little you ever had to offer one another. With Taymor gone, and the ruins of her monstrous Lovecraftian vision overrun by Lilliputians, there's simply nothing to see here, other than the sort of ""stunt spectacular"" that wouldn't look out of place amid a backdrop of roller coasters and toddler vomit. It's a vast emptiness, void even of its animating madness. It shuffles and smiles and subsides, like a good inmate, its hummingbird heartbeat slowed to a crawl. Put your head to Spidey's chest, and all you'll hear is the dull smack of a damp wad of cash hitting the boards.",New York Magazine,Scott Brown,06/14/2011
Big Fish,8,Review: Hyperkinetic 'Big Fish' Emerges With Heart,"While acknowledging that the show is about a self-consciously rambling and absurdist hero, the bloated 90-minute Act 1 threatens to derail as visual gags, projections and busy scenes - plus a book that uneasily mixes whimsy and cancer - bombard the senses....Butz proves he's simply in a league of his own, able to switch from middle-aged to teenager in a snap, offering a complex portrait of a Southern man while avoiding good 'ol boy cliches, and he even spends some of the night lying in a hospital bed, not the most expected way to lead a musical. But then there are lots of other fun surprises at ""Big Fish,"" including elephant fannies.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,10/06/2013
Big Fish,8,Hooked by storytelling in 'Big Fish' the musical,"With the indefatigable, deeply engaged and seemingly irreplaceable Norbert Leo Butz driving its storytelling and willing the show's crucial emotional subtext into being by sheer force of talent and will, ""Big Fish"" arrives on Broadway as an earnest, family-friendly, heart-warming and mostly successful new American musical. Modestly and movingly scored by Andrew Lippa, ""Big Fish"" is set in the Deep South and honors that region's love of tall tales without exploiting the Southern stereotypes so common to the genre of musical theater.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,10/06/2013
Big Fish,8,STAGE REVIEW Big Fish,"With his stocky build, short stature, and thinning hair, Butz is an unlikely leading man, but he has the loose-limbed energy and charisma of a young Dick Van Dyke. The radiant Kate Baldwin is underused as his sympathetic wife, though she brings her silken voice to the beautiful second-act ballad, 'I Don't Need a Roof' - one of the highlights of the mostly tuneful score by Andrew Lippa (The Addams Family). Steggert is less compelling as their not-so-likable son, particularly in the problematic second act saddled with several superfluous fantasy numbers and an ending that packs less of an emotional wallop than it should...For the most part, though, Big Fish finds theatrically inventive ways to reel audiences into its central love story. In this case, it isn't boy-meets-girl but father-hooks-son. And Edward Bloom is quite a catch.",Entertainment Weekly,Thom Geier,10/06/2013
Big Fish,8,"Review: Norbert Leo Butz, with ""Big Fish"" to Fry","Norbert Leo Butz, as Edward, is as charismatic as ever in this father-and-son fable, based on Tim Burton's 2003 film about a traveling salesman who tells far-fetched stories...The two-time Tony winner leaps, swaggers and sweats his way through more than two-and-a-half hours of fair-to-middling show tunes with enough visual spice to keep us engaged, if not quite tapping our fingers along in our armrests....Where ""Big Fish"" gets stuck in the shallows is with its score, by Andrew Lippa (""The Addams Family""). A brash musical demands you leave the theater wanting to buy the cast recording, or at least humming a song. ""Big Fish"" doesn't, though ""Be the Hero,"" which bookends the production, is catchy enough, in spite of its been-there-heard-that message: you should ""be the hero of your own story.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,10/06/2013
Big Fish,8,"‘Big Fish’ Is a Gorgeous, Charming, Dream Musical: Review","I doubt Broadway has ever seen a prettier, more sensuously kinetic musical than Susan Stroman's adaptation of ""Big Fish"" set to music by Andrew Lippa (""The Addams Family."") It's enchanting, especially once it slows down a bit to catch its breath. That doesn't happen until the second act, but it won't matter much, even to fans of the Tim Burton movie (or the Daniel Wallace novel that started it all). When the brooding trees begin their laconic dance before morphing into swamp witches, you know you're watching a Stroman show. By then, we've already fallen under the spell of Edward Bloom, Alabama homeboy, teller of tall tales and creaky jokes, absentee husband and father.",Bloomberg,Jeremy Gerard,10/06/2013
Big Fish,7,Review - BIG FISH Makes Wholesome The New Hip,"Wholesomeness gets a bad rap on Broadway these days, usually regarded as the kind of unbearably sweet and inoffensive entertainment that sophisticated theatergoers must endure while taking their conservative grandmas out for a night on the town...But Big Fish, the new musical that tattoos its heart on its arm, displays no fear in plopping its unabashed wholesomeness right in your lap. Its spirit is steeped in Rodgers and Hammerstein decency that propels an evening that's adventurous, romantic and, yeah, kinda hip. That said, the work of Andrew Lippa (score) and John August (book, based on his own screenplay of Daniel Wallace's novel) is not exactly top shelf musical theatre (although on paper Big Fish easily outclasses any original-run Broadway musical currently on the boards) but director/choreographer Susan Stroman, at the top of her game, whips this warmhearted story into a supremely imaginative and heart-tugging entertainment.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,10/06/2013
Big Fish,7,'Big Fish' won't quite reel you in,"When Edward proposes to his future wife, Sandra, hundreds of yellow daffodils sparkle against a clear blue sky.Somehow, though, the effect isn't as dazzling, or as moving, as you would hope -- particularly given the talented players involved in this production, which opened Sunday at the Neil Simon Theatre...Butz, Baldwin and Bobby Steggert, as the grownup Will, all bring a sense of genuine humanity to their roles. In the end, though, this Big Fish lacks the imagination or cohesion to reel you in like one of its hero's yarns.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,10/06/2013
Big Fish,7,Broadway Review: ‘Big Fish’,"Resisting the usual Broadway tendency toward over-production, this show is perfectly scaled to the modest level of Edward's boyish daydreams. Invention, not excess, seems to be the dominant house rule, from the tight choreography, which is quick and clever and never over the top, to the primary-color projections by Benjamin Pearcy that make a comic-book universe of Julian Crouch's sets. William Ivey Long captures the playful vibe with ingenious costumes that move in unexpected ways (like the fishtail of a mermaid's silvery costume) and contribute their own magic to the storytelling (like the witches that materialize from the trees in a forest). The main thing missing from this show - and might have taken the edge off its unlikable hero and unpalatable message - is the mystical sensibility that flavors Southern storytelling. Although supposedly set in Alabama, there's not a hint here, musical or otherwise, of the traditional magic found in regional folktales. The kind of magic that might transform a selfish character like Edward Bloom into the hero of his own dreams.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,10/06/2013
Big Fish,7,Big Fish: Theater Review,"The musical slaps on the sentiment with a heavy hand, and given that it's ultimately quite moving, that's no crime. But I couldn't get past fundamental problems with the source material...While the lyrics are more literal than imaginative, not to mention doused in Hallmark syrup, Lippa's score is better than his last show, The Adams Family. It freely mixes old-fashioned Tin Pan Alley with pop, using banjos to evocative effect for a show set in Alabama and Mississippi...But many audiences will lap it up, and nobody's begrudging them that. A lot of loving craftsmanship has gone into this musical, and it delivers satisfying entertainment for those who don't mind being emotionally manipulated",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,10/06/2013
Big Fish,6,A Dad’s Tall Tales and a Down-to-Earth Son,"For a show that celebrates tall tales, ""Big Fish"" feels curiously stunted. Granted, this movie-inspired musical about a whopper-spinning traveling salesman, which opened on Sunday night at the Neil Simon Theater, is certainly big by most conventional measurements...""Big Fish"" fails to forge the crucial connection between its characters and their fantasies. Featuring songs by Andrew Lippa and a book by John August, this musical is about one of those impossible, wonderful, embarrassing fathers whose ghosts have done so much to keep psychiatrists in business...[Susan Stroman] seems to be drawing almost randomly from her bottomless bag of tricks. Yes, her use of dancers to embody an enchanted forest and a campfire is delightful. And it's hard not to chuckle when those two-stepping elephants make a cameo appearance. But if the show is all about the need for personal myths, it has to let its leading mythmaker take charge...Not once did I feel that what I was seeing had been spawned by the teeming mind of Edward Bloom. The show's de facto theme song may advocate ""be the hero"" of your own life, but somehow ""Big Fish"" turns everyone into a local-color extra.",New York Times,Ben Brantly,10/06/2013
Big Fish,6,Hack score undermines Broadway version of ‘Big Fish’,"There's a huge gap between what you see and what you hear in ""Big Fish."" Visually speaking, this new Broadway musical is inventive, playful and often downright magical. But then, we expect nothing less from director Susan Stroman, the whiz behind ""The Producers"" and ""The Scottsboro Boys."" Unfortunately, Andrew Lippa's score is a hack job stringing one banal non-tune after another. Every time Broadway takes one step forward musically (""Matilda,"" ""Once""), it takes two back with safe, witless junk like this. Those who heard Lippa's disposable contribution to ""The Addams Family"" can't say they weren't warned.",NY Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,10/06/2013
Big Fish,6,Big Fish,"Big Fish feels like the show that got away. Adapted by John August from his own 2003 screenplay, the musical is built around the tall-or at least well-stretched-tales of an Alabama-born traveling salesman, Edward Bloom (Butz), who has a penchant for embellishing his life...Yet the show is hobbled by a major flaw: Andrew Lippa's thoroughly mediocre score. The music suggests a cross between familiar, inflated Broadway pop and 1970s AM radio; the lyrics vacillate, sometimes line to line, between banal colloquialism and stiltedness... Big Fish has lovely sequences, and earns some sniffles at the end. But it could have been a real catch",Time Out NY,Adam Feldman,10/06/2013
Big Fish,6,"‘Big Fish’ Theater Review: It Sings, It Dances, but Wait — Isn’t That ‘The Little Mermaid’?","Very early in the new stage musical ""Big Fish,"" director Susan Stroman delivers a splashy ensemble number, ""Be the Hero,"" that effectively introduces us to many of the fantastical characters we know from Tim Burton's 2003 film version and the original novel by Daniel Wallace. The difference, however, between seeing them onscreen or reading about these mythic figures is that when they're forced to sing and dance right off the bat with no introduction, there's a distinct feeling of the wrong kind of déjà vu. Is that Ariel from ""The Little Mermaid""? One of the witches from ""Wicked""? The circus ringmaster from ""Pippin""? And the giant from ""Shrek""? Suddenly, they're not archetypes anymore but rather the stars of some ""Best of Broadway"" theme-park show...The problem is, neither Stroman's staging nor Andrew Lippa's songs expand upon or deepen our understanding of these stock Broadway figures.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,10/06/2013
Big Fish,6,‘Big Fish’: Theater review,"Stroman's dances - tap, waltz, hoedowns - are polished but a bit pedestrian.

In fact, there are many pleasures in this ambitious but disappointing adaptation of Daniel Wallace's Walter Mitty-esque novel and Tim Burton's 2003 movie about a father's inability to make a truthful connection with his serious son...So it's crushing to realize, early on, that this gentle, sincere, beautiful-looking show is deadly dull. Author John August, who also wrote the screenplay, strings sentimentality and hackneyed picaresque escapades together as if they were equivalent balls on a string. Tension never builds, even when Edward's son Will (Bobby Steggert) tries to unravel the father's secret life.",Newsday,Linda Winer,10/06/2013

The Snow Geese,9,Mary-Louise Parker stars in a graceful 'Snow Geese',"...after a slow start, White's play (jointly produced by Manhattan Theatre Club and MCC Theater) evolves, under Daniel Sullivan's meticulous direction, into a lovely, moving account of a clan's struggle to adapt to trying circumstances and a changing world. White's Broadway debut, The Other Place, produced earlier this year, also followed a middle-aged woman whose grasp on reality was challenged, but it was a psychological mystery that blurred lines between past and present, imagination and fact. This more conventionally structured study of unlucky souls seems to have been written under Chekhov's spell.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,10/24/2013
The Snow Geese,8,Review: THE SNOW GEESE Sees America Through Chekhovian Eyes,"And if White's text doesn't shine any new light on the subject, the play is engaging enough when matched with Daniel Sullivan's handsome, mostly well-acted production, featuring distinguished visuals by John Lee Beatty (set), Jane Greenwood(costumes) and Japhy Weideman (lights)...Unfortunately, Mary-Louise Parker's wispy and underwhelming performance lacks the necessary depth, often speaking too quickly and softly to be understood. Far more strength and craft is displayed by Victoria Clark as her pragmatic and devout sister, Clarissa, and Danny Burstein as Clarissa's thickly accented German husband, a doctor keeping Elizabeth on medication to sooth her depression.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,10/24/2013
The Snow Geese,8,Something satisfying about ‘Snow Geese’,"Director Daniel Sullivan smoothly handles White's melodramatic story, which also includes Elizabeth's religious sister, Clarissa, and her German husband, Max.

The Snow Geese,7,Broadway Review: ‘The Snow Geese’,"Mary-Louise Parker is much too delicate and entirely too fashionable (in stunning widow's weeds designed by Jane Greenwood) to be stuck in Syracuse in the dead of winter and at the end of the Gilded Age in America. But that's the price of playing a Chekhovian heroine in ""The Snow Geese,"" Sharr White's bland homage to the master of upper-class existential malaise. The family in this domestic drama is, indeed, as melancholy as any family in a Russian play. But they're so shallow and self-centered that they are welcome to their misery.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,10/24/2013
The Snow Geese,7,The Snow Geese: Fighting On,"Those drawn to ""The Snow Geese"" for the star at the center of it, Mary-Louise Parker, might be disappointed to discover a vulnerable, careless woman whose demons have been exposed after the untimely death of her husband. It won't come as a surprise, though, for those who saw playwright Sharr White's other Broadway play earlier this year, ""The Other Place."" A common thread runs between those two plays about the mania that follows the loss of a loved one...As Elizabeth dreams of her husband's reemergence, Parker shows off her acting chops. It's a scene that sits tangential to the drama taking place around it, but it lends incredible insight into Elizabeth's troubled mind and heartbroken soul. To some degree, the play could use more of those moments, where Elizabeth appears to be alone, but is much more alive in those moments than at any other point in the play. They also give the audience a chance to marvel at what talent Parker brings when the stage clears and makes way for her.",Huffington Post,Danny Groner,10/24/2013
The Snow Geese,7,NY1 Theater Review: 'The Snow Geese',"""The Snow Geese"" characters share Chekhov's thematic constant - boredom. The challenge is how to write about it without becoming it.

The Snow Geese,6,A Matriarch’s Cold Realities Pile Up,"""The Snow Geese,"" a fable of a family that isn't as rich as it thinks it is, is unlikely to stir any emotion other than bewilderment as to how this lifeless play wound up on Broadway. I can answer that question in two words (or three, if you don't count hyphens): Mary-Louise Parker...On its own, though, Mr. White's play remains a muddle of pastiche parts that never cohere into an original and organic whole. And the cast members - who include the excellent Broadway veterans Victoria Clark and Danny Burstein and several attractive young newcomers - fail to convince us, and perhaps even themselves, otherwise. The same might be said of Ms. Parker, whose preternaturally youthful face seems frozen in mild astonishment, as if she were surprised to find herself here.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,10/24/2013
The Snow Geese,6,Theater review: 'The Show Geese',"It takes some time -- too much really -- for the conflict to develop. But in time, ""The Snow Geese,"" as directed by Daniel Sullivan with his characteristic polish, turns into the atmospheric character study that White intended. Jonigkeit's emotional transformation in disposition is the unexpected centerpiece of this production. While Parker brings a credible fragility and vulnerability, she comes off as too contemporary for a period piece. As family members, Danny Burstein and Victoria Clark offer fine performances that are remarkably sober compared to their acclaimed turns in numerous musicals.",amNY,Matt Windman,10/24/2013
The Snow Geese,6,'The Snow Geese' review: Family muddle,"How sad, then, that the play is such a muddle. It's an interesting neo-Chekhovian muddle, mind you, and I'm not a bit sorry to have shared the time with White, 43, a late-blooming playwright whose corporate job has been supporting his family in their Hudson Valley home. Given the rich situation and director Daniel Sullivan's darkly luscious production, however, the disappointments hurt. Parker, whose extensive theater career includes her Tony-winning performance in Sullivan's staging of ""Proof,"" makes a fascinating, poignant wraith -- a lost soul in silky black mourning gowns (by Jane Greenwood), just beginning to realize how much is lost. But her voice is sometimes hard to hear, especially in the wordy exposition when everyone in the family is babbling at the same time about many important plot points. Victoria Clark is exquisitely down to earth as the pious sister, while Danny Burstein has touching fury as the German-born doctor enduring wartime xenophobia.",Newsday,Linda Winer,10/24/2013
The Snow Geese,6,The Snow Geese,"While The Snow Geese inherits some of the less appealing aspects of 19th-century dramas-lengthy exposition, laborious bird metaphors-it does not share those works' depth of feeling or insight.

The Snow Geese,5,The Snow Geese: Theater Review,"But homage is a tricky thing, in this case making for a tedious play that's stubbornly unaffecting, its pathos hollow and manufactured. Daniel Sullivan's Broadway production has elegance to spare. The same goes for the gorgeous sets of John Lee Beatty, which revolve to ingeniously allow for different perspectives on the same space of an early-20th century family hunting lodge in upstate New York, opening onto the wild marshes outside. Jane Greenwood's period costumes also are handsomely detailed. But the overwhelming impression remains that a lot of care and effort has been put into a play that acquires a pulse only intermittently...while Parker can be a dangerous and exciting stage actor to watch, her idiosyncratic mannerisms often place her inside a bubble with little connection to the other players on the stage; that contributes here to make an unsympathetic character more distancing.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,10/24/2013
The Snow Geese,5,Theater Review: The Snow Geese Is Chekhov à la Cuisinart,"The Snow Geeselacks two qualities whose absence can't be finessed. One is freshness. Whereas Christopher Durang's Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike, another Chekhov gloss, successfully put the master's archetypes in amusingly new situations, White gives us a play we feel like we've already seen...The actors do what they can, but here, too, there is a mismatch. On one team you have Mary-Louise Parker as Elizabeth, looking lovely in her widow's weeds. Parker can be extraordinarily compelling when playing contemporary characters; her thinking process, with all its starts and stops and pauses and reversals, is unusually legible and honest. (She'd be excellent in White's terrific play The Other Place, recently on Broadway.) Characters who are less modern pose a problem for her though, because they are usually written to think withthe lines, not between them. Parker just doesn't gravitate that way, and because her pull is so powerful the audience gets dragged into her style instead of the play's, and so do some of the young actors playing her sons.",Vulture,Jesse Green,10/24/2013

Some compensation comes from a fine-tuned cast led by Mary-Louise Parker, who's at her signature idiosyncratic best...White raises lots of ideas - about parental favoritism, culture clashes and sibling rivalries. He doesn't fully develop any of these notions. And Arnold's 11th-hour solution to money woes should have been obvious to the whole family from the get-go.

They are terrific when they kiss, and they do so with a frequency perfectly in synch by their characters' savage love.

Despite the presence of some fine actors who manage to light some sparks here and there, this gimmicky rendering of Shakespeare's tale of adolescent lust gone tragic is curiously lacking in tension, passion, romance and, for some cast members, clear diction.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,09/19/2013
Romeo and Juliet,5,Such Sweet Sorrow,"Mr. Bloom, in a first-rate Broadway debut, and the gifted Ms. Rashad exude a too-fine-for-this-world purity that makes their characters' love feel sacred...Yet, while the production features stunning columns of flame as part of its eclectic mise-en-scène, it never acquires the fiery, all-consuming urgency that ""Romeo and Juliet"" should deliver...Good as she is in the early scenes, Ms. Rashad doesn't yet have the vocal heft and variety to take Juliet into the echoing halls of tragedy...On the other hand, Mr. Bloom, famous for being handsomely heroic in the ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchises, keeps surprising. For once, we have a Romeo who evolves substantively, from a posturing youth in love with love to a man who discovers the startling revelation of real love, with a last-act descent into bilious, bitter anger that verges on madness.",New York Times,Ben Brantly,09/19/2013
Romeo and Juliet,5,‘Romeo and Juliet’ on Broadway is Shakespeare in Modern Dross,"Would that Mr. Bloom's big entrance led to something interesting, but this ""R & J"" is a slick, weightless assemblage of modern-dress trickery (Romeo wears a hoodie and jeans) whose conception is as stale as its been-there-seen-that décor and TV-movie music. From the low-impact knife fight to the brutally abridged tomb scene (what happened to Paris?), it proceeds systematically along its overfamiliar way, never missing a chance to be obvious. When the star-crossed lovers paw one another lasciviously at their first meeting, you can almost hear Mr. Leveaux assuring himself, ""That ought to thrill the kiddies.""",Wallstreet Journal,Terry Teachout,09/19/2013
Romeo and Juliet,5,Theater Review: 'Romeo and Juliet',"The real battle at the new Broadway revival of ""Romeo and Juliet"" has nothing to do with Capulets and the Montagues. It's actually between Orlando Bloom and Condola Rashad, the show's young, photogenic leads, who are offering flavorless performances full of fakery, and the adult actors in supporting roles who wipe the floor with them...Bloom, after making a bafflingly cheesy entrance on a motorcycle, gives an empty, uninteresting performance marked by shrill line readings. Rashad wears Juliet's naïveté like a mask that prevents her from offering any other facial expressions. At least she's graceful.",amNY,Matt Windman,09/19/2013
Romeo and Juliet,5,'Romeo and Juliet' review: Not in Bloom,"Alas, these lovers are not just star-crossed but so mismatched that they could be from different galaxies in director David Leveaux's busy-with-brainstorms but broad and surprisingly unmoving production. Bloom -- more famously the elf prince and a Caribbean pirate -- makes a dashing, appealing, if not exactly youthful Romeo. He has a flashy entrance in ripped jeans on a motorcycle that, ask not why, is never seen again and he catapults from a playful romantic to a doomed one with a winning grace. It hurts to have to say this, but Rashad -- who has much-deserved Tony nominations for ""Stick Fly"" and ""The Trip to Bountiful"" -- is not a natural Shakespearean. Her voice has little variety, and she basically has two expressions -- happy and n",Newsday,Linda Winer,09/19/2013

I was watching a good actor laboring against a director's two-dimensional construct: Bloom couldn't possibly have chosen to be so flat and uninflected...Yet Leveaux seems intent on underscoring the difference not only in their ages but in their levels of maturity.

Romeo and Juliet,5,Theater Reviews: Romeo and Juliet and Women or Nothing,"In the absence of all suspense - though not of pacing, which is fairly fleet, almost brisk - the show is taken over by spotlight supporting roles, most notably Jayne Houdyshell, who steals the show as Juliet's nurse. Houdyshell is, of course, a brilliant stage performer, but when the Nurse runs off with yourR&J, chances are it wasn't secured properly in the first place. Mercutio's another matter: As the only brilliant person in this rather dull crew of partisans, prigs and puppy-lovers - and thus the only crazy person, as well - he's designed to walk away with the whole shootin' match. Christian Camargo doesn't disappoint: A skinny-jeaned, leather-jacketed apparition, he's like some Billyburg poseur driven mad by the dawning recognition of his waning powers of bullshit. As a verbal duelist, Camargo's the very butcher of a silk button - he speaks in short stabbing motions, milks nothing, hits everything, jumps back before he's worn out his welcome.",Vulture,Scott Brown,09/19/2013

The Winslow Boy,9,Review: Masterful Rees Heads THE WINSLOW BOY,"Director Lindsay Posner's swift and riveting production comes to Broadway from London's Old Vic. The entirely recast Roundabout staging revolves around a masterful performance by Roger Rees as ailing family patriarch Andrew Winslow. It's a study in subtle details as he valiantly keeps a brave and noble face during the two years the story covers as his health deteriorates, his judgment is questioned and everything he's worked for seems to be crumbling at the latter stages of his life...Though the play never leaves the Winslow drawing room, Rattigan did a remarkable job of keeping suspense and tensions high throughout the evening with detailed descriptions of what was happening in court. This is The Winslow Boy's first Broadway revival since initially visiting in 1947 and Posner's crackling production makes you wonder what took so long.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,10/17/2013
The Winslow Boy,9,Broadway Review: ‘The Winslow Boy’,"Like some forgotten treasure found in the attic, the Old Vic's radiant revival of ""The Winslow Boy"" - now presented on Broadway by the Roundabout Theater - practically glows in the dark. Terence Rattigan based his 1946 drama on the actual experience of an upper-middle-class family whose legal defense of a son's honor became a cause celebre when its brief against the English political establishment was debated in London's High Court. A top-drawer ensemble masterfully helmed by Lindsay Posner and headed by Roger Rees do the honors in this tense legal drama, which Rattigan has shrewdly taken out of the courtroom and into the drawing room.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,10/17/2013

The Winslow Boy,9,First Nighter: Terence Rattigan's The Winslow Boy Superb in Lindsay Posner's Roundabout Production,"The Winslow Boy is a well-made play, yes, but it deals with a problem for which the solution is patently not well made. To allow the situation to unfold persuasively, Rattigan does some remarkable writing--taking care to give every character the chance to have at least one spotlighted center-stage moment. Those lucky enough to be handed multiple chances to shine are each of the Winslows, the suave Sir Robert, the conflicted John Watherstone and well meaning but unlovable Desmond Curry...But where to begin passing out individual laurels? Probably with Rees, who presents a stern Edwardian gentleman who isn't in the best of health when he first appears and whose resolve slowly takes its visible toll. When Rees impressed Manhattan audiences as Nicholas Nickleby a few decades ago, he was wonderful. He's been wonderful in various assignments ever since, but this may be his best outing since the initial one. Let's just say it is.",Huffington Post,David Finkle,10/17/2013

The Winslow Boy,8,Father May Not Know Best,"Anchoring the production is Mr. Rees's perfectly modulated performance as Arthur, on whom the anxiety and notoriety surrounding the case take the most physical toll. When the play begins, he is obviously a man whose physical prowess is on the wane, even if his mind remains sharp, but as the months and years pass, he grows stooped and infirm. Mr. Rees movingly intimates that, underneath his confident exterior, Arthur has also become prey to thoughts of how heedlessly, and perhaps permanently, he has endangered his family's fortunes: his eyes glitter with disturbed imaginings.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,10/17/2013

The Winslow Boy,8,The Price of Righteousness,"If you want to know how ""The Winslow Boy"" should be played, look to either of the excellent film versions, which were directed by Anthony Asquith in 1948 and David Mamet (yes, that David Mamet) in 1999. Don't let that stop you from seeing this production, though, in which enough is right to obscure what's wrong. The actors, as I say, are exceptionally fine, especially Ms. Parry, the ever-satisfying Michael Cumpsty, and Alessandro Nivola, who is exceedingly well cast in the show-stopping role of Sir Robert Morton, a languidly haughty barrister who finds himself swept up in the Winslow case far more fully than he ever expected. Moreover, Peter McKintosh's set and costumes evoke with admirable accuracy the ""solid but not undecorated upper middle-class comfort"" that Mr. Rattigan calls for in his stage directions...And Mr. Posner deserves high marks for not overplaying the possibility of a romance between Catherine and Sir Robert, a coarsening mistake of taste that is made in both film versions of ""The Winslow Boy.""",Wallstreet Journal,Terry Teachout,10/17/2013

The Winslow Boy,8,Theater Review: The Old-Fashioned Emotional Play of The Winslow Boy,"Quick and confident characterizations, along with a very delicate balancing of them, are needed to keep a play so full of contrary energies from pulling apart; the Roundabout's 2011 Rattigan outing, Man and Boy, suffered from a too marvelous, overwhelming central performance by Frank Langella. Here, despite Nivola's bravura, the fireworks are better distributed, with Roger Rees, as the curmudgeon, mostly keeping in check his eagerness to amuse. Instead, he carefully delineates the steps along the path of the father's crisis, from gleeful chin-first aggression to obsession to exhaustion to resignation. And Michael Cumpsty, looking like a walking toothache, turns in a beautifully modulated comic performance as the nice man who will never get his girl.

The Winslow Boy,8,The Winslow Boy Review: A Feminist Comedy Before Its Time?,"Billed as a transfer of the production of the play done by the Old Vic in London, the set and costume design by Peter McKintosh emphasizes how British this play - they are both sumptuous and staid. The play, at two hours and 45 minutes (including intermission), takes its time. But the surprising humor, and the vibrant and detailed performances of the cast, especially Roger Rees, who noticeably deteriorates over the two years that the play takes place, and Charlotte Parry as his equally stubborn daughter, offer so much more juice than the more overtly relevant (and far duller) play of Rattigan's that the Roundabout revived two years ago starring Frank Langella , Man and Boy. ""The Winslow Boy,"" the 18th production of a Rattigan play on Broadway, but only the third over the last 40 years, is more likely to make theatergoers wonder whether there is anything else of his as worth reviving.",New York Theatre,Jonathan Mandell,10/17/2013
The Winslow Boy,7,"'Winslow Boy' short on surprises, long on charm","At its best, the play is an entertaining, and ultimately touching, study of these characters; and the new production -- which the Roundabout Theatre Company imported from London's Old Vic (with a new cast) -- delivers that with predictable warmth and ease. The polished authenticity is established immediately by Peter McKintosh's handsome set, which captures the upper-middle-class comfort of the Winslows' existence in the years just before World War I... As that comfort is threatened by Arthur's crusade, Roger Rees makes the toll physically palpable. Rees' Arthur seems to age before our eyes, growing wearier and more feeble, but retains the overwhelming devotion to Ronnie that transcends family pride. It's impossible not to root for this patriarch, even when his loved ones are frustrated by him...The truth, while more complicated, is no harder to predict than any of the developments in Winslow Boy; but this winsome revival will charm you nonetheless.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,10/17/2013

And Rupert Holmes (The Mystery of Edwin Drood) does an admirable job of condensing Grisham's 600-plus-page book, jettisoning entire subplots and characters (the wife of Jake, our defense lawyer hero, for instance) while emphasizing the story's dramatic highlights. Unfortunately, this also means that character development often gets short shrift. Ashley Williams' Boston-bred law student, who joins the defense team and has a brief flirtation with Jake, seems particularly sketchy...

I especially enjoyed the elliptical, only half-intelligible conversations between Jake and his mentor, disbarred, sleepily devious Lucien Wilbanks (Tom Skerritt), a progressive sot who enjoys regular regressions into Margaritaville. Skerritt is so relaxed, you can barely understand his cottony mouthfuls of dialogue, but he's a loose, disarming present in a highly staged, totally controlled environment.

Mr. Anderson sings with a soft, captivating intensity, and the orchestrations often appealingly evoke Carlebach's original recordings.

Soul Doctor,6,Review: Unusual rock star rabbi hits Broadway in colorful but mostly tuneless ‘Soul Doctor’,"The new Broadway musical ""Soul Doctor"" examines the life and times - and music - of Shlomo Carlebach in a unique, if plodding, study of a charismatic holy man who finds himself stuck between an unstoppable force and an immovable object. Carlebach, widely considered to be the modern era's father of Jewish popular music, makes for a fascinating biographical subject, even if the re-orchestrations of his staid, folksy compositions aren't quite lively or diverse enough to fill a two-hour, 30-minute musical...In the lead role, Anderson displays a formidable presence - and beard - with a disarming mix of placid shyness and childlike bursts of kinetic energy.",Associated Press,Peter Santilli,08/15/2013

Soul Doctor,6,Broadway Review: ‘Soul Doctor’,"Lots of luck marketing ""Soul Doctor"" to a general audience. This worshipful musical biography of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, the so-called ""Rock Star Rabbi"" credited with infusing Jewish music with the musical idioms of 1960s pop culture, has obvious appeal for its core audience of fans.

Soul Doctor,5,STAGE REVIEW Soul Doctor,"Oy gevalt. It's not that there's anything particularly terrible about Soul Doctor, the biographical musical about the late 'rock-star rabbi' Shlomo Carlebach, but there isn't all that much to recommend either. Carlebach is certainly an interesting figure: An Orthodox Jew who embraced pop music and hippiedom over traditional scholasticism and rose to prominence in the 1960s, he served as a striking countercultural counterpoint. But director Daniel S. Wise's production - which consists mostly of a Judaic jukebox of Carlebach's popular melodies - fails to achieve anything beyond a standard, and occasionally cringeworthy, retelling of his life.",Entertainment Weekly,Keith Staskiewicz,08/15/2013

Wise's episodic book. But the show digs shallowly into its central character and his beliefs, and often rings false.

Yet perhaps Tyson's best scene is with ex-Dukes of Hazzard star Tom Wopat. You'd think a burly, white small-town sheriff going nose to nose with a tiny black woman would be unsettling.

Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike,7,Theater Review: Christopher Durang’s Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike,"The real problem is how the different parts of the play connect to one another.... You begin to get the feeling that Durang, in modeling his structure on Chekhov, invested in the best luggage available and then packed it like someone with five minutes to get to the airport. Some of what comes out of the valise is gorgeous: thoughtful, quiet moments but also perfectly crafted comedy scenes that sustain their dizziness for improbably long stretches. Other elements-notably the borderline-offensive black cleaning lady, who's all sass and voodoo-make you think: Why did he bring that?...Like its Chekhovian characters, Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike is assembled from mismatched parts and is desperate for affection, which it miraculously earns.",Vulture,Jesse Green,03/14/2013
The Nance,9,The Nance: Theater Review,"In The Nance, Douglas Carter Beane undertakes an archeological investigation into the homosexual subculture of late-1930s New York, which in itself seems an audaciously unfashionable enterprise in this age of gay marriage and increasing social acceptance. Perhaps the playwright's intention was to remind today's complacent audiences of the injustices of an intolerant society. If the ambitious play ultimately doesn't dig deep enough to find the ideal balance between its delirious low comedy and pathos, at the very least it provides a tremendous vehicle for Nathan Lane.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/15/2013

It helps to have a bona fide (and certifiably bankable) star like Nathan Lane casting his glow in the title role of a Depression-era comic who plays ""pansy parts"" in burlesque shows. Another smart move was booking this period piece into a beautiful old Broadway house. The final coup was entrusting the helming to Jack O'Brien, whose impeccable taste in casting and keen eye for design guarantee a seamless show.",Variety,Gordon Cox,04/15/2013

As portrayed with shiny expertise and dark conviction by Nathan Lane in a production that opened on Monday night at the Lyceum Theater, Chauncey looks every year of whatever age he may admit to, and then some, whenever he's not onstage...This Janus-faced persona makes Mr. Lane a natural for the divided soul that is Chauncey, and he doesn't disappoint. Moving between his natural and artificial selves in increasingly adverse circumstances, his Chauncey flips the on and off switch so often that it finally short circuits, to devastating effect...But even Mr. Lane can't reconcile all the disparities Mr. Beane's script asks him to weave together.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,04/15/2013

The Nance,8,Theater Review: The Nance Makes Ideal Use of Nathan Lane,"For Beane, the play is a revelation that effects a rehabilitation. After writing the books of three fairly trite musicals, he has found a way to harness his love of camp and make it do something other than amuse with diminishing returns. When The Nance is sharp, it's very sharp indeed. But it isn't perfect; Beane will go almost anywhere for a joke, even years into the future, and the storytelling gets woozy and frankly a bit lost whenever it leaves the central plot behind...But Lane, in the apotheosis of his sad clown routine, is sensational throughout. Rarely have his innate qualities of pathos and quacking cheer been put to better use; it's hard to decide whether Beane has given him a part he was born to play or he has given Beane a role he was born to write.",Vulture,Jesse Green,04/15/2013
The Nance,8,Nathan Lane Bares All as Comic Queen in ‘Nance’: Review,"There are moments when ""The Nance"" feels too contemporary, though the play resists the snide humor afflicting Beane's adaptation of ""Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella,"" which opened earlier this season. But it's also a sympathetic love story about one damaged man's inability to feel deserving of more than anonymous sex...Lane, in his best performance since ""The Producers,"" brings considerable heart to Chauncey's ambiguities...Jack O'Brien has directed with his usual sensitivity, never allowing the play to devolve into a camp fest.",Bloomberg,Jeremy Gerard,04/15/2013

Chronicling Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia's crusade to wipe out burlesque, accomplished in part by the persecution of gay people, in 1937 New York City, the show offers taut direction from Jack O'Brien and a tour de force turn from the brilliant Nathan Lane.

And they've assembled a crack comic team to play the Irving Place performers...the priceless Lewis J. Stadlen portrays Efram, Chauncey's usual scene partner. Stadlen and Lane have built up quite the easy-breezy comic rapport over the years in shows such as Laughter on the 23rd Floor, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,Mizlansky/Zilinsky or 'Schmucks', and The Man Who Came to Dinner.

Possibly Broadway's one legitimate box-office name, Lane has played versions of Chauncey Miles before...As he's previously demonstrated, he has the uncanny ability to make audiences laugh while tugging at their heartstrings -- the gift indicating more than a spark of genius...Lane's stance, his expresssion at the final curtain -- the cause of the despair won't be revealed here -- may not be earned by Beane's play, but at that moment the actor beautifully compensates for anything and everything that up until then might have been missing.",Huffington Post,David Finkle,04/15/2013

She seems to have taken a cue from Jessica Hecht's heartbreaking Julie in keeping the pathos at bay as resolutely and as long as possible. When it finally insists itself-as it does, for instance, in a very quick gulp of regret handled with marvelous economy by Judith Light as Faye-it is much more painful than a weepy speech would have been.

Film star Tom Hanks, in his Broadway debut and first stage appearance in more than 30 years, displays potent theatrical technique and dispenses the requisite charisma as the bombastic newspaper flack. Audiences primed for seeing Hanks in the flesh probably won't care about the flimsiness of his vehicle and the reams of rat-a-tat-tat narration that shackle it.",Backstage,Erik Haagensen,04/01/2013
Lucky Guy,6,Theater review: ‘Lucky Guy’,"At its best, the drama cracks with the smoky and gritty atmosphere Ephron knew firsthand from her own days as a reporter.

Lucky Guy,5,STAGE REVIEW Lucky Guy,"Lucky Guy boasts a posthumous script by the beloved late writer and director Nora Ephron; the Broadway debut of super-duper movie star Tom Hanks; and the real-life story of Mike McAlary, a swaggering New York tabloid columnist...That's a lot of juicy back story - none of which saves Lucky Guy from its fate as a dull, stalled play about a not-particularly-noteworthy mug with a flair for self-promotion. Two hours of Lucky Guy and a theater-goer with no previous knowledge of McAlary and his tabloid cronies will still have no idea why Ephron was so enamored of this blowhard, no sense of McAlary himself, and no explanation for why a Broadway production, directed by the inventive George C. Wolfe with so much energetic set-changing and stage business, nevertheless feels so inconsequential and dramatically inert. C+",Entertainment Weekly,Lisa Schwarzbaum,04/01/2013

Ann,8,Ann: A Fiery Political Pillar,"The best parts of the show come at the beginning and the end when Taylor is back at the front of the stage, comfortable at the podium, making eyes with the crowd. That's where Richards became most prominent and established herself as a political force. Sure, she needed time to campaign behind the scenes to get voters behind her.

With no live foils onstage — another unavoidable condition of the genre — Taylor works the room relentlessly. Every laugh is procured and brought home like pork. And while she is a fine enough actress to integrate that kind of wolfishness into her characterization, you can’t help thinking it would be nice if she could press some actual onstage, co-star flesh. After all, it’s not just a good line and good politics, but good playwriting advice as well, when Taylor has Richards say, near the end, “Why should your life be just about you?”",Vulture,Jesse Green,03/07/2013
Ann,6,Ann: Theater Review,"Taylor’s intention is admirable in shining a spotlight on a woman driven by a heroic passion for public service. But the longer the show runs on, the more its lack of shading becomes apparent. She peppers the dialogue with pandering audience nods to racial and gender equality and gun laws. But she glosses over the potentially juicy stuff such as the dirty politics that tried to keep Richards out of office the first time and succeeded when she ran for a second term. It also might have been interesting to include a wry acknowledgment that Richards’ failed re-election bid gave her the dubious distinction of opening the door to the political career of George W.

Is there any ingenue role in musical theater that Kelli O’Hara — of “The Pajama Game” and “South Pacific” revivals — couldn’t make her very own? In “Nice Work,” even given a stellar cast, when she’s on the stage she often is the single focus, by sheer force of her ability to sing any song fully in character, and deliver it with a striking musicality. This leaves her leading man, Matthew Broderick, in an uncomfortable position.

""Orphans"" remains as synthetic as ever, only now Tom Sturridge, Ben Foster, and Alec Baldwin do the bravura thesping...In a fearlessly physical turn, Sturridge gives Phillip sweetness and vulnerability, emphasizing his all-but-smothered intelligence and wide-eyed desire to learn. Foster's Treat is at first a boiling cauldron of rage, his lid ready to blow at the slightest provocation...Broadway veteran Baldwin snaps with paternal authority as Harold and is amusingly sentimental in the man's desire to help these two boys...The actor misses, however, the edgy sense of menace that Mahoney brought to the role.",Backstage,Erik Haagensen,04/18/2013

She also has the manic energy of a woman whose refusal of the comforts of sleep - and more pointedly, the healing balm of dreams - has taken her beyond fatigue...Provocative as much of the content is, Toibin is not doing anything so blunt as a revisionist interpretation of the Scriptures. He is undertaking a nuanced psychological exploration of a figure whose nobility is due in part to her eternal silence, rendering her instead here as a woman who will not be silenced.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/22/2013
The Testament of Mary,9,Theater Review: The Quite Contrary Testament of Mary,"Mary is becoming more modern, or rather, incorporating more modernity into her timelessness. This is subtly and thrillingly done, not just by Shaw, who is endlessly resourceful and even manages to squeeze a few laughs from the definitionally tragic material...The Testament of Mary does not work like most other plays, solo or otherwise, nor even like Tóibín's wonderful novella, which seems to occur spontaneously-an immaculate conception-in the reader's imagination.

His text, though it started as a play, is more impressive as a novel. In its dramatic format, there's an occasional choppiness to the transitions and the ending is abrupt...But ""The Testament of Mary"" belongs to Shaw, one of the most versatile and commanding stage actresses in the English-speaking world.

She has a tendency, especially early in the show, to show you how. bloody. hard. she's acting! And director Deborah Warner allows too much neurotic prop-moving business and italicized bits of mugging.

Ms. Shaw gives us that woman, for sure... But if you're going to give us a vision of Mary as we've never seen her, why would you block the view?...I was never happier - or more harrowed - than in those rare quiet, contained moments when this Mary made us feel that we were in a private tête-à-tête with a woman who had an extraordinary story to tell, and needed to keep telling it, forever and ever.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,04/22/2013

""She isn't a phony because she's a real phony,"" as someone explains to the writer who lives next door to her. ""She believes all this crap she believes.""

The tunes that work best find Anastasio and cowriter-lyricist Amanda Green at their musically Phishiest - notably the bitter, Foster-sung 'God Answered My Prayers.' But the pair's excursions into country, blues, and a clutch of other genres rarely rise above the generic.

Speed is important to keep the audience guessing, but it leaves no room for a moment's error. Mantello proves as sharp as the narrator is unreliable.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,01/10/2013
The Other Place,8,Theater Review: Laurie Metcalf Astonishes in The Other Place,"Metcalf supplies the gravitation that holds it all together, even as her immense centrifugal energy is, simultaneously, working to fling it all apart. Her physical and spiritual transformation over the course of this brief, intense story is total. I greatly enjoyed The Other Place in its original Off Broadway incarnation, but I wondered if Joe Mantello's exquisite, bounded-in-a-nutshell production would scale up to Broadway. It does, I'm thrilled to report, and a great deal of the credit is due Metcalf herself, who's found several clever ways-near-subliminal physicalization, megaphonic emotional projection-to turn a delicate chamber performance into a great ringing cry from the darkness, suitable for an amphitheater.",Vulture,Scott Brown,01/10/2013
The Other Place,8,"Review: Laurie Metcalf, Torn Between Here and ""The Other Place""","Metcalf's Juliana is two different women: the first, a businesslike medical researcher-turned-pharmaceutical rep; the second, a disintegrating mother distancing herself from reality. Juliana's fear about her health manifests as anger and sarcasm, and is particularly potent in scenes like one where she bites the head off her doctor for not allowing her to smoke in her office ... which is inside a hospital. Anyone can get sick, but is it the truly brilliant people who have the most trouble when control over their bodies is wrenched away? Metcalf makes us feel her fear.",MBC New York,Robert Kahn,01/10/2013
The Other Place,8,Theater review: ‘The Other Place’,"The supporting cast is topnotch, including Daniel Stern as Juliana's beleaguered husband, Zoe Perry (Metcalf's real-life daughter), who plays a doctor and a bitter divorcee, and John Schiappa in a couple small roles. But it's really all about Juliana, a brittle individual who seems even tougher than she did during the first run. She's now caustic enough to come with a warning label. It's not a fluke, considering that Ian says to his wife: ""You know, what surprises me almost more than anything else is how cruel this thing has made you."" It's a harsh reality. And played by Metcalf, it hurts so good.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,01/10/2013
The Other Place,8,Laurie Metcalf in 'The Other Place' review,"Metcalf's Juliana begins tough and funny, oozing a sexuality that cannot be separated from her braininess. Against startling changes of sound and light designs, her body -- including those no-longer-confident legs -- shape-shifts as she is pummeled by delusions and a genuine life-altering trauma. Operating within a honeycomb of overlapping wooden frames, Metcalf transforms from moment to moment and back again, from sublime competence to a helplessness that is hard to watch. But dare you to take your eyes off her.",Newsday,Linda Winer,01/10/2013
The Other Place,8,Laurie Metcalf In The Other Place: My Review,"The Other Place might lack poetry--or Wit--but its emotional moments are potent. And Metcalf? Unforgettable. She even holds focus for the half hour before the play starts, sitting onstage in a chair, fiddling with a device, and trying to make sense of things. I could definitely do without this gimmick in general, but 30 minutes more of Metcalf is always a good thing.",Village Voice,Michael Musto,01/10/2013
The Other Place,8,STAGE REVIEW The Other Place,"Julianna is a perfect fit for Laurie Metcalf, a Steppenwolf Theatre veteran best known for her Emmy-winning work on Roseanne. Still lithe in a slim black skirt and jacket with a black and white top (the costumes are by David Zinn), Metcalf radiates a brusque intelligence and mordant wit with occasional flashes of raw and childlike vulnerability. Hers is a mesmerizing performance",Entertainment Weekly,Thom Geier,01/10/2013
The Other Place,7,'The Other Place' looks at 'a woman in-between',"Juliana's seeming deterioration and her struggle to come to terms with it raise intriguing questions about our emotional and intellectual autonomy; and director Joe Mantello, who initially helmed the play off-Broadway last year, guides his fine cast with sensitivity and wit. Metcalf, who earned an Obie Award in that earlier production, gives a performance as impressive for its elegance as it is for its fearlessness. Even in Juliana's most lost, desperate moments, we're aware of her native mental agility and her fierce pride, which make her painful journey all the more poignant.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,01/10/2013
The Other Place,7,Metcalf’s Wit Hides Ravaged Mind in ‘Other Place’: Review,"Laurie Metcalf's performance as Juliana in ""The Other Place"" has both sharpened and deepened since Sharr White's drama ran off-Broadway nearly two years ago. Given a second outing, now on Broadway under the wing of the Manhattan Theatre Club, the one-act drama still packs a formidable punch...but ""The Other Place"" has lost some power in the interregnum. The most easily identified reason is a significant casting change: Where Dennis Boutsikaris was sharp, even severe as Ian, Daniel Stern is warm-and-fuzzier, less of a foil to Juliana...Like ""The Great God Pan"" earlier this season, ""The Other Place"" is yet another ambitious play that's maddeningly unfinished.",Bloomberg,Jeremy Gerard,01/10/2013
The Other Place,7,Metcalf’s mesmerizing in a dark ‘Place’,"The play is less riveting than it is reasonably engaging. It's not entirely new, either, having premiered downtown two years ago. As for the ""thriller"" tag, let's just say the decorous Manhattan Theatre Club is behind this Broadway transfer, so don't expect fisticuffs.",NY Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,01/10/2013
The Other Place,6,Theater review: 'The Other Place',"The play succeeds best as a showcase for Metcalf's acting skill. Perry, who also has a third role as a kind of interloper in the story, provides strong support. Stern, though, gives a lightweight effort as Juliana's put-upon husband.",Bergen Record,Robert Feldberg,01/10/2013
The Other Place,5,Theater Review: 'The Other Place',"""The Other Place"" is essentially a stream of consciousness monologue padded with a few scenes and flashbacks to add a bit of substance and suspense. It feels derived from previous plays about smart women confronting illness, such as ""Proof"" and ""Wit."" With all due respect to Metcalf, who never leaves the stage and gives a brave and raw performance, ""The Other Place"" leaves much to be desired. 2 stars.",amNY,Matt Windman,01/10/2013
Evita,9,Evita: Theater Review,"While Buenos Aires-born Roger is new to Broadway, this production made her a star in London, where it originated in 2006. At the risk of sounding harsh, the actress is physically unprepossessing – short and beaky – not to mention occasionally shrill in the vocal department. But she acts the hell out of the role. ... The other bit of headline casting is Ricky Martin as Che. Moving away from the original production’s clear allusions to Che Guevara, he appears here as an enigmatic peasant worker who serves as the bio-musical’s narrator and its voice of skepticism, seeing the beatified “Santa Evita” for the ravenous spotlight-seeker she really is. His dramatic presence could be more aggressive, but Martin’s Latin-pop vocals are a smooth fit for the role, and his relaxed charm and dreamboat looks will yield few complaints. Fans eager for him to bust some serious dance moves have to wait until midway through Act II, but he eventually turns on the trademark sizzle.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/05/2012

Evita,8,Don't cry for this graceful 'Evita' revival,"Though Rogers' voice isn't strong, her singing has a raw ache and folky authenticity. She also moves like a gazelle, reinforcing Eva's beguiling sensuality and adding further sparkle to Ashford's earthy, vibrant dance numbers. The narrator, Che, isn't presented as the flamboyant revolutionary (based on Che Guevera) he became under Harold Prince's original direction. A charming Ricky Martin plays the character more as an amused, sometimes sympathetic spectator; though critical of Eva, as Rice's lyrics demand, he also conveys a certain tenderness.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,04/05/2012
Evita,8,"Eva Perón, Superstar","Never having seen Harold Prince's much-admired original production of ""Evita,"" I'm not in a position to compare it to this one, and in a way I'm glad. Despite the inadequacies of its nominal star, Mr. Grandage's ""Evita"" is an impressive achievement that should be judged on its own merits, which are legion. Even if you don't like Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, it will hold your eye from curtain to curtain.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,04/05/2012
Evita,8,"‘Evita’ Returns With Grand Sets, New Eva, Ricky Martin","Eschewing the character’s familiar military fatigues and stogy, Martin plays Che (who never had anything to do with Argentina) as a populist observer. He’s more the jaunty, glinty- eyed critic than the embodiment of dashed hopes. In an open shirt and suspendered slacks, his eyes crinkled and mustache a bushy wonder, Martin exudes bonhomie.
That’s not enough to offset the comically shameless Perons, especially given Rice’s compressed libretto. We’re left to connect a lot of dots. In her Broadway debut, Roger has plenty of the star quality Evita sings about. I worry how long her voice, a little brittle at the top, will hold up, even on a limited performance schedule.",Bloomberg,Jeremy Gerard,04/05/2012
Evita,8,'Evita' revived on Broadway,"This time we have a fierce dynamo of a Broadway debut by Elena Roger as Eva, the ambitious street girl with a contradictory fondness for finery, Mussolini and the poor, and who slept her way to superstar first lady before dying of cancer at 33. Roger, despite a few frayed top notes at Tuesday's preview, is a justly celebrated Argentine native whose sprite of a dancer's body belies a massive theatrical presence and the steely heft of her tangy voice.

Evita,7,'Evita' Review: Ricky Martin Is Easily The Best Thing About This Revival,"Much of the buzz coming from the new revival ""Evita"" has been about the spitfire Argentine playing the title role. But all of the heat actually comes from the guy shaking his bon-bon. Ricky Martin is easily the best thing about this revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's bio of Eva Peron, which opened Thursday at the Marquis Theatre. He sings beautifully, dances gracefully, athletically climbs ladders, plays his role with a knowing sneer and elicits drools in his suspenders and tight white shirt. He even makes a mustache work. In fact, maybe it's time for Broadway to have a new rule: Put Ricky Martin in everything. He would fit in happily at ""Newsies."" He would definitely enliven ""Death of a Salesman."" Heck, put him in ""Mary Poppins"" and watch the roof really lift off.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,04/05/2012
Evita,7,Evita,"Director Michael Grandage scores with a dynamic new ""Evita,"" graced by an impressive performance from Argentinean actress Elena Roger and the ticket-selling presence of recording star Ricky Martin, who acquits himself nicely if not remarkably. The 1979 Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice poperetta comes off fairly well in its first Broadway revival, thanks to a director who doesn't seem crimped or intimidated by Hal Prince's striking original staging. That said, the flaws inherent in the material -- typified by grasping-at-straws rhymes like ""That's what they call me/so Lauren Bacall me"" -- remain. Look for boffo biz so long as Martin chooses to stay.",Variety,Steven Suskin,04/05/2012
Evita,7,NY Review: 'Evita',"The production is entertaining enough for those who are satisfied to hear the now-familiar score—including “You Must Love Me,” which was written for the 1996 film version starring Madonna—pleasantly performed. Musical supervisor–conductor Kristen Blodgette deserves credit for the precise delivery of Rice’s wordy lyrics and Lloyd Webber’s rich tunes. But if you yearn for a powerful wallop to your gut, listen to either of the original cast albums and fall under the spell of Paige or LuPone.",Backstage,David Sheward,04/05/2012
Evita,6,Requiem for a Kingmaker,"Despite the hard work of its spirited leading lady, the Argentine actress Elena Roger — supported by a barely there Ricky Martin and a sterling Michael Cerveris — this musical combination of history pageant and requiem Mass feels about as warmblooded as a gilded mummy. ... I thought I was fully immune to the show’s signature song, “Don’t Cry for Me Argentina,” from having heard it everywhere (even discos) in my youth. But darned if that slippery thing, whose melody is a repeated leitmotif in the show, hasn’t attached itself like a leech all over again. And can anyone advise me about how to expel from my brain the jinglelike refrain, “I wanna be a part of B.A./Buenos Aires — Big Apple.” The show’s ads, borrowing from Mr. Rice’s lyrics, have it that “the truth is she never left you.” No, the notes she sings were just lying dormant, like a virus, waiting to infect our systems all over again.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,04/05/2012

Golden Boy,10,Odets’ ‘Golden Boy’ Gets Golden Revival From Lincoln Center Theater,"In these days of the small-cast, tidy domestic drama, what a pleasure it is to encounter Clifford Odets’ soaring, expansive, and tough-as-nails “Golden Boy,”...A sumptuously talented cast of 19 digs into the tale of would-be violinist Joe Bonaparte, who forsakes music in favor of a high-stakes career as a boxer for monetary reasons…Joe is fueled by a rage he can neither articulate nor comprehend, and the extraordinary Seth Numrich makes that central to his knockout performance...Space limitations forbid me saluting all the fine turns in the company. At the top of the heap is Tony Shalhoub’s decent, courtly, and finally devastated Mr. Bonaparte. Yvonne Strahovski shines as the sullen Lorna, holding her own in a man’s world with engaging feistiness...Danny Mastrogiorgio gets Moody’s self-doubt and sweaty hunger for success exactly right, while Anthony Crivello makes a welcome return to the New York stage as Fuseli, scarily psychopathic and shot through with latent erotic desire.",Backstage,Erik Haagensen,12/06/2012
Golden Boy,9,The Sweet Science vs. the Stradivarius,"The skills [Sher] evinced in that rewarding revival [“Awake and Sing!”] are on view here, too: a knack for making Odets’s vernacular language feel like fresh mint instead of stale corn, and a gift for cutting to the emotional quick of a conventionally structured melodrama…As the young hero, who is determined to make himself over into the kind of man the world reveres, Mr. Numrich (“War Horse”) moves with an antic grace in the play’s early scenes...There is music in the way Mr. Numrich moves that hints at the lyric temperament Joe once felt as a salvation..., and now feels as an inhibiting burden…The process is watched from a distance by his loving father, played with impressive delicacy by a sad-eyed, soft-spoken Tony Shalhoub….Mr. Shalhoub infuses his performance with an elegiac tenderness that never descends into the maudlin….“Golden Boy” is at times dragged down by predictable plot mechanics that obscure the ripped-from-the-gut honesty that glittered more fiercely in earlier Odets plays. Some passages are too bluntly written, tapping out the play’s moral message in telegraphic language that makes you wince….But even the play’s pulpier excesses...are brought home with conviction by the cast.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,12/06/2012
Golden Boy,9,Review: Broadway revival of Clifford Odets’ ‘Golden Boy’ dazzles in the darkness of boxing,"A dazzling revival of Clifford Odets’ ”Golden Boy” opened Thursday, still packing a punch after 75 years. Tyson could do well to watch how to successfully put together a show about the rise and fall of a boxer…Tony Shalhoub is a stand-out as Bonaparte’s father, a role whose lines are written in broken Italian-accented English which could be a disaster in the wrong hands...But Shalhoub is so skilled that only a deeply felt character emerges…Numrich, who starred as the young farm boy Albert Narracott in “War Horse,” is a nimble former “shrimp with glasses” here, maintaining his air of insecurity despite a toned physique and a solid left hook. The actor nicely does impetuousness and brashness, but also you can feel his inner tumult at betraying his father….Sher has embraced the realism of this dark world — the sweat, gore and rushes of blood to the head. There are passionate kisses but always a lingering threat of violence. The place reeks of leather and failure.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,12/06/2012
Golden Boy,9,Golden Boy: Theater Review,"Nothing hammers home the anemia of many new plays being presented on Broadway today quite like the comparison of watching a robust nugget from the national theatrical canon such as Clifford Odets’ Golden Boy....While aspects of the three-act drama are inevitably dated, what remains most impactful – and is spectacularly well served in Sher’s production – is the sheer beauty of Odets’ language, with all its jangly musicality, shifting rhythms and flavorful vernacular. That comes from a finely tuned ensemble working in tight harmony…Numrich is especially impressive. Showing a startling leap in maturity and range from his role in War Horse, he charts Joe’s heartbreaking corruption from restless uncertainty to fierce, consuming drive...Sher and his actors allow Odets’ words to breathe and his characters to acquire three-dimensional form. The result is majestic theater.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,12/06/2012

Mostly, the production combines an exhilarating fast-talking swagger with both Odets' real and overwrought lyricism.",Newsday,Linda Winer,12/06/2012

The show's old-country characters and cobblestone street slang may have aged into artifacts of Old New York, but the story still has plenty of energy and surefooted emotion even if it doesn't quite pack a knockout punch….In the play's opening act..., Odets' razor-edge dialogue sets the drama in motion so intelligently and with such casual wit that each scene practically demands its own curtain call. It isn't until the third act that weighty moral issues drag the show down from its high spirits. But by then you'll be seduced fully enough by director Bartlett Sher's light-footed pace and Michael Yeargan's evocatively lean sets to root for Golden Boy to the final round.",Entertainment Weekly,Adam Markovitz,12/06/2012

""Golden Boy,"" on the other hand, has been cast with an abundance of excellent stage actors, including not just Shalhoub and Numrich but also Danny Burstein, Jonathan Hadary, Anthony Crivello and Danny Mastrogiorgio. Numrich, who most recently appeared in ""War Horse,"" makes a convincing transition from cockeyed youth to restless and reckless champ while exposing Bonaparte's insecurities. Shalhoub, who is best known for his comedic work, is genuinely touching in the father role. Yvonne Strahovski, one of very few females in the cast, more than satisfies as the seemingly hard-as-nails dame who engages in an affair with Joe on top of her other affair with Joe's manager.",amNY,Matt Windman,12/06/2012

When this clever and joyous entertainment opened last March, there were immediate murmurings about a Main Stem transfer. There were also fears that Rick Elice's adaptation of Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson's novel would lose its special charm in a cavernous Midtown theater.

Peter and the Starcatcher,8,Effortless Flights of Fancy,"Ben Brantley, The New York Times: The extravagantly resourceful ensemble members of “Peter and the Starcatcher” have almost nothing in the way of modern machinery to support their sky-scraping journeys. On the contrary, there’s little here that couldn’t be found in a theater 150 years ago. What they do have is some ordinary rope, a couple of ladders, a few household appliances, two toy boats and, most important, one another. And they have you, dear theatergoer, because in this ecstatic production you’re as important a part of this process as they are. ... None of this could be achieved if the actors didn’t have a level of synchronicity and reciprocal trust that you associate with master ballet troupes. As the cast members take turns delivering the narrative, the others instantly assume the myriad shapes and guises being described.

It is best to appreciate the play if you don’t expect it to do for Peter Pan what “Wicked” does for The Wizard of Oz – best, in other words, to see it not as a clever take on a beloved story but as a new entertainment with its own delights.

The cast is fantastic and hardworking and collaborative, the sets are weirdly inventive, but its trip north has not done it any favors. ...

Chaplin,8,Broadway review: ‘Chaplin’,"In the new musical Chaplin, which is every bit as entertaining as Charlie Chaplin himself, Rob McClure portrays the film genius with an irresistible sweetness, like candy you can't - and don't want to - stop eating…Director-choreographer Warren Carlyle gives the musical some inspired touches, not least of which is the scenes of movie-making, which play out while the real film flashes in the background. Carlyle also lets McClure take over - but makes sure the actor's Chaplin is far more nuanced than just little-tramp screen imitations. In the end, the compact, sparkling McClure – like Chaplin – makes you believe he can perform just about anything and command an ovation for it.",Philadelphia Inquirer,Howard Shapiro,09/10/2012
Chaplin,7,"The Tramp, Beyond Limelight","More broadly, though, this sour-smell-of-success story…is steeped in a sense that Chaplin the person, as opposed to Chaplin the fabled silent comedian, has gone missing in action, devoured by a swarm of man-eating clichés….The lens through which we see most of “Chaplin,” though, is blurred, as if with Vaseline. In his 1964 autobiography Chaplin made it clear that he had little use for most interpretations of his psyche, whether high-brow (via Freud or W. Somerset Maugham) or low (the gutter press and fan magazines). So I shudder to think what he might have made of the psychiatrist’s couch he’s been plopped on for “Chaplin: The Musical.”",New York Times,Ben Brantley,09/10/2012

Chaplin,7,Theater Review: Chaplin: The Musical,"Chaplin seems to be dragging some ghostly vestiges of its road self. (Under another title, Limelight, it underwhelmed at La Jolla Playhouse.) The first act relies heavily on a creaky film conceit. (We’re supposed to be on a bare soundstage, watching Chaplin’s film of his own life — though the only meaningful sign of this is a recurring slate boy, calling out scene changes.)

Chaplin,6,Review: 'Chaplin' falls flat trying too hard,"The new musical ""Chaplin"" opens with the sight of the Little Tramp balanced on a tightrope high above the stage. It's a fitting metaphor for the show itself – a wobbly, high stakes attempt to avoid gravity. Guess what happens? Gravity wins…Rob McClure in the title role certainly deserves more than this to work with. He has clearly put his heart and soul into playing Chaplin – he not only sings and acts with feeling, he also tightropes, roller-skates blindfolded, does a backflip without spilling any of his drink, and waddles with a cane like a man who has studied hours of flickering footage. But save for one sublime scene in which the various inspirations behind Chaplin's decision to embody the Little Tramp is revealed, the show McClure leads is equal parts flat, overwrought and tiresome.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,09/10/2012

But they have come up all thumbs, alas, in the writing and staging departments.

It's impossible to believe that the creator of such masterpieces as ""Modern Times"" and ""The Gold Rush"" would express himself in such prosaic, cliched terms. He may not have spoken in his works, but he surely was thinking up a storm with every twitch of his Tramp's eyebrows.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,09/10/2012
Chaplin,6,'Chaplin' the musical isn't all song and dance,"There are surely few harder-working men in show business right now than Rob McClure, the immensely likeable star of the new Broadway musical Chaplin. In the title role, that of film legend Charlie Chaplin, McClure begins the show literally walking a high wire. For more than two hours, he is the dominant figure onstage, aging from a teenager to an octogenarian while alternately channeling his character's unique genius for physical comedy and singing his guts out. As if that's not enough, Chaplin's leading man must also traverse a book...with enough mawkish melodrama to fuel a dozen silent-film parodies.

Chaplin,5,Theater Review: 'Chaplin',"You've probably seen worse musicals than ""Chaplin,"" a forgettable biography of Charlie Chaplin. But how did this slow-paced and sentimental musical, which has the taste of a cup of coffee mixed with a dozen packets of sugar, make it to Broadway? The songs of Christopher Curtis - who has previously written theme songs for the Discovery Channel - are occasionally tuneful but mostly tacky. Still, they are far better than the show's melodramatic and strange book…Even if ""Chaplin"" were a better crafted musical, it would still remain a mostly futile enterprise.

Sennett (Michael McCormick) barks, “Do that walk again!” But “Chaplin” -- whose derivative songs are by Christopher Curtis, the inert book by Curtis and Broadway veteran Thomas Meehan -- has little else to recommend it. Curtis’s talents do not include pastiche; you’d never know the period here extends from pre-WWI to the 1970s.

Dead Accounts,6,"Prodigal Son, Dripping Sweat and Mystery","This comedy about a prodigal son, returned from the wilds of New York City to his family in Cincinnati, seems to float out of memory even as you’re watching it. Ms. Rebeck, the author of“Seminar” and “Mauritius,” keeps throwing out weighty subjects — from the ethics of Wall Street to the existence of God — but never cultivates them into anything approaching a solid existence. They all blur into a single jet stream of semisnappy dialogue before changing course a few times and evaporating…For at least its first 15 minutes “Dead Accounts” does manage to command your attention. That’s because its first scene is essentially a sustained aria of nervous energy for Mr. Butz...Ms. Rebeck doesn’t seem to have settled on a tone or, for that matter, a subject. “Dead Accounts” is, I think, meant to be about the inflation of the superficial in a materialistic society, and the attendant, unsatisfied craving for belief...But the play never follows through convincingly on any of its ideas.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,11/29/2012

Dead Accounts,6,Dead Accounts: Theater Review,"Directed with a nimble hand by Jack O’Brien, the Broadway production assembles a terrific five-person cast. Two-time Tony winner Norbert Leo Butz is in typically wired, Energizer-Bunny form, with Holmes ably playing foil. After appearing in a supporting part in the 2008 revival of Arthur Miller’s All My Sons, the actress brings a lovely naturalness to her first starring Broadway role, along with frazzled warmth and judicious glimmers of a more brittle edge...The play, however, suffers from the same shortcomings that often cramp the theater work of Rebeck...Dead Accounts is all surface polish and minimal depth. It has lively dialogue, well-drawn characters and a smattering of smart observations about contemporary life. But it never acquires thematic coherence. The set-up is capable if a little unhurried, but the payoff is negligible, too often stuffing overworked wisdom into its characters’ mouths to make points upon which the writer fails to expand.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,11/29/2012
Dead Accounts,6,'Dead Accounts' on Broadway: Reality's in short supply in this mystery,"Rebeck clearly intends to lampoon her mercurial Manhattan milieu and treat the Midwest without the usual condescension. But one of the many problems with this script, which is entertaining and zesty in a moment-by-moment way but really does not hang together as a credible dramatic story, is that it relies on the dodgy assumption that people in Cincinnati actually define themselves, all the time, as heart-of-America Midwesterners, when, in fact, they think of themselves as Cincinnatians, residents of a pretty urbane locale…""Dead Accounts"" holds one's attention, not least because it allows the hyperkinetic Butz to energize the piece. He is a lot of fun throughout, especially when playing opposite Houdyshell's dry wit. Holmes...generally lacks sufficiently expansive definition, but, in the few moments of actual revelation, she finds some poignancy in her relationship with her character. None of these actors, though, can help the lack of credibility of some of the play's central devices.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,11/29/2012

Written on commission by a theater in Rebeck's hometown of Cincinnati, the script pretends to embrace Midwest over New York values but flattens both into insults...On the plus side, audiences coming to see a miscast Holmes will be introduced to Norbert Leo Butz. The actor, actually the star of the play, does yet another of his nonstop hyperactive eccentrics with which he won Tonys in ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" and ""Catch Me If You Can.""

Dead Accounts,6,STAGE REVIEW Dead Accounts (2012),"Norbert Leo Butz is no stranger to playing shady characters...In Dead Accounts, Theresa Rebeck's engaging but unsatisfying new dramedy, he brings a fast-talking charm to a New York banker named Jack who suddenly shows up at his parents' suburban Cincinnati home with suspicious stacks of cash...With the exception of Jack, though, the characters are as thin as old dish towels. Holmes, effortlessly sympathetic in an underwritten role as a dithering thirtysomething, tears into a populist rant against banks and flirts playfully with Jack's still-in-Ohio high school pal Phil (Josh Hamilton)...The first act of Dead Accounts plays like a claustrophobically staged TV pilot...But Act 2 is like the second episode of a 13-show season, ending on a mini-catharsis as modest as a churchgoing Midwesterner. A full season (or further re-writing) might have allowed Rebeck to flesh out her promising setup, but this wisp of a show pays steep penalties for premature withdrawal.

Dead Accounts,5,Review: 'Dead Accounts' with Katie Holmes doesn't add up to serious drama,"[Holmes is] charming, natural and, yes, about as fresh-faced as a moisturizer model.

Sharing the stage with Holmes is two-time Tony winner Norbert Leo Butz, who pulls out all the stops in the play's leading role…he delivers a performance of frenetic gusto as Jack...Butz practically ricochets off the walls of the simple Midwestern kitchen that's the setting for ""Dead Accounts,"" but not even he can transcend the contrived nature of a character who is really nothing more than a collection of manic playwriting impulses...director Jack O'Brien...isn't able to sort out the problem through his staging.

Dead Accounts,5,Theresa Rebeck’s New Comedy ‘Dead Accounts’ Is DOA on Broadway,"Prolific playwright Theresa Rebeck is on a downward spiral with her Broadway offerings. The problematic but interesting “Mauritius” was followed by the flashy but empty “Seminar,” and now there’s “Dead Accounts,” the lazy and predictable comedy at the Music Box Theatre that wouldn’t even pass muster as a Lifetime movie. Indeed, its presence on the Great White Way would be inexplicable without film star Katie Holmes in the cast, in an undemanding role that any number of actors could have played...Under Jack O’Brien’s just-go-for-it direction, Norbert Leo Butz works feverishly to make something out of Jack, employing his spectacular gift for physical comedy while infusing Jack’s rants with musicality and as much conviction as he can summon. Unfortunately, there’s no there there, and this talented actor’s work is reduced to a bag of tricks...Rebeck was once a promising, obviously talented writer.

Dead Accounts,4,Theater review: ‘Dead Accounts’,"In lieu of an engaging story, unseen people, including the sibs’ sick dad, are gabbed about while undeveloped thematic strands dangle.

After an hour, Jack’s wife, Jenny (Judy Greer, miscast as a model of urbanity), arrives and reveals that her soon-to-be ex has raided neglected bank accounts of dead people to the tune of $27 million. The huge sum is a device to reveal Jenny’s greed and to give Lorna an aria about why she can’t fret about banks getting screwed.
Director Jack O’Brien can’t do much with the material, so he puts his energy into moody scene changes. And he cast Butz, who he guided to Best Actor Tony wins in “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” and “Catch Me If You Can.”",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,11/29/2012

Michael Shannon is subtly show-stealing as a disfigured and disenchanted NASA scientist...Multiple Emmy-winner Ed Asner, back onstage for the first time in more than two decades, only has two brief scenes as a pest-control technician — but they're the two that perhaps most characterize the message of ""Grace.""

Director Dexter Bullard (Bug, Mistakes Were Made) knows how to spotlight the standout beats and, for the most part, minimize the water-treading and showboating.

And while all the performances are solid, I often had difficulty in believing these characters as something other than figures in a parable…If ""Grace"" winds up haunting you, it will be because of Mr. Shannon’s performance. And give credit to those who cast him, against obvious type, as the passive Sam instead of the increasingly crazy Steve...It’s when Sam is allowed, briefly, to imagine things might be otherwise that the dialectic of ""Grace"" acquires achingly human impact.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,10/04/2012

The show—an epic tale of a boy and his horse, based on Michael Morpurgo’s 1982 children’s book, and performed by humans and puppets—is beyond dramaturgy, and it’s too big and emotional for anything as small as opinion. It’s a force of nature, or, more accurately, a show about the nature of man, which the co-directors, Marianne Elliott and Tom Morris, shape with the utmost control and artistry. Everything about it works, especially the animals—horses, birds, even a goose—which were created by the Handspring Puppet Company. (Actors manipulate the puppets to convey the animals’ souls.)

(My highest praise is that I assumed I was seeing the British production transplanted to New York City; only later did I realize that it has been recast with American actors.)

An Enemy of the People,6,Theater review: 'An Enemy of the People',"Ibsen wrote the play, at least in part, as a response to the public outcry against his previous play, ""Ghosts,"" which bashed Victorian morality and made reference to syphilis. Lenkiewicz seems to give special emphasis to Stockmann’s conflicting qualities. The problem with that, aside from meshing his contradictions into a single, recognizable human being, is that it sticks out of the play like a sore thumb.

The world of adult films doesn't lend itself to cleanliness…The funny thing is that the show has a pure heart and a traditional feel-good message despite the waving of adult toys, simulated sex acts and language that would trigger a seizure in a network censor. Read has somehow found sweetness in porn…Director Evan Cabnet has aimed at, and struck, the tender heart in a script that could easily be performed with more darkness or more cartoony.

In David West Read's new play, which opened Wednesday at the Longacre Theatre, Henry Winkler appears as Chuck Wood, an aging porn star given to crowing about his, um, sizable credentials.

The Performers,7,The Performers: Theater Review,"The money shot of this production is an incandescent comic turn by Ari Graynor, her inventive line readings matched by the daffy expressivity of her face and body. As for David West Read’s play, it’s a so-so Broadway boulevard comedy with a generous dose of raunch. But while the material is as skimpy as Mandrew’s suede microshorts, the cast works on this fluff like expert fluffers…The playwright has concocted himself a fertile setup for comedy but fails to do anything creative with it...Julian Fleisher’s jazzy scene-change music underscores that, beneath all its licentiousness, this is at heart an old-fashioned Broadway comedy.

The Performers,6,Innocents Abroad in a Land of Naked Ambition,"“The Performers” offers proof positive that it’s possible to talk real dirty and still be the squarest show in town. Even in a season featuring two works by a king of Anglo-Saxon expletives like David Mamet, this comedy by David West Read may well clock the most obscenities per minute of any play on Broadway. Nonetheless Mr. Read’s perky account of innocents in porn land, centered on a film awards presentation in Las Vegas, feels like a throwback to the more discreetly risqué entertainments of 40 and 50 years ago. Though its author is only 29, “The Performers” is like an early Neil Simon farcewith an X-rated vocabulary, or a blue-tongued episode of the smirky but sentimental TV series “Love American Style.”…Mandrew’s wife and sometime co-star, Peeps...is played by Ari Graynor, who turns out to be Mr. Jackson’s ideal comic match. In endowing cartoon characters, whose punch lines are visible long before they land, with something like sincerity and spontaneity, these two work wonders. Unfortunately, with “The Performers,” wonders soon cease.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,11/14/2012
The Performers,6,Theater Review: The Performers,"Truth be told, nothing feels entirely necessary in The Performers. Why is Mandrew named Mandrew? Straight male porn stars don’t have names like “Mandrew.” (Jackson has a prime physique more in line with the requirements of gay porn, but Read, beyond one intriguing little feint near the top of the show, doesn’t go There, or anywhere near There.) So Mandrew is Mandrew because and only because “Mandrew” is funny to say — at least, the first sixteen times. And The Performers is acceptably funny, too, if you disconnect most of your brain, including the part connected to your genitals. Believe me, you won’t need ’em: Light disdain and affectionate superiority toward cartoon sex dolls with crotches Barbie-smooth is all that’s required of you. Sex comedy — even in gelded, rom-com form — probably ought to pump something carnal out of the subconscious. Read, it seems, is too busy drilling for corn.",Vulture,Scott Brown,11/14/2012
The Performers,6,Theater Review: 'The Performers',"While ""The Performers"" is hardly an ambitious play and the characters tend to be either rigidly stupid or uptight, it is undoubtedly a crowd-pleasing show, combining raunchy humor with a simple setup and conservative emphasis on monogamy. As skillfully directed by Evan Cabnet, the likable and very attractive cast indulges in all the silliness without going too overboard. Of course, the real standouts are Graynor and Jackson for going to such ridiculous, childish and idiotic extremes. Winkler, whose character is three decades older than everyone else, appears to be having a good time.

Nothing wrong with that, but it takes real smarts to make dumb people funny. A string of easy puns and double entendres and faux XX-film titles like “Spontaneass” aren’t enough to elevate this beyond a raunchy extended skit. Don’t read that as prudishness.

Clybourne Park,9,STAGE REVIEW Clybourne Park,"Thankfully, Pam MacKinnon's crackerjack production hasn't lost any of its punch since its 2010 premiere at Off Broadway's Playwrights Horizons; in fact, it's tighter, a touch faster paced, and even more unflinchingly intense. And actors have only improved (though improvement was by no means necessary). Dickinson makes Lena ever so slightly more sympathetic; Kirk is even more beautifully clueless in both her roles; and Shamos, an always terrific, long-unheralded actor, is a poker-faced marvel as both Karl and Steve.",Entertainment Weekly,Melissa Rose Bernardo,04/19/2012
Clybourne Park,9,Broadway review: 'Clybourne Park',"The cast on Broadway has come from a production in Los Angeles, staged at the same time Philadelphia’s Arden Theatre Company was running its own. The Arden’s version, directed by Ed Sobel, came off a bit differently than the Broadway production, which opened Thursday night. The second act — when Norris really lets loose with his characters’ intimations about racial issues surrounding the sale of a property to a white couple in a solid and upscale African American neighborhood — is mined more for laughs on Broadway, where it’s directed by Pam MacKinnon. The Arden’s production, while undeniably funny, was more intense as it progressed, giving the issues at stake a higher focus. While that’s the interpretation I prefer, there’s nothing awry about the show on Broadway, where it provides all the food for thought and lets you do the grazing by yourself.",Philadelphia Inquirer,Howard Shapiro,04/19/2012
Clybourne Park,9,Clybourne Park,"Rarely in American drama have the gaps between what one wants to say, how one says it and what one really feels been as hilariously explored for dramatic effect as Norris is able to pull off here. There are secrets in this house and surprises, too, expertly managed by helmer Pam MacKinnon on Daniel Ostling's thematically expressive set, in the hands of a brilliant and versatile company. All are united in the task of peeling back society's veneer to confront the terrors lurking below the surface. ""Clybourne Park"" has no easy answers for the questions it raises about the historical roots and present-day dimensions of racial disharmony. But it sharpens the viewer's antennae for the obfuscation in which we timidly traffic when trying to discuss those questions, and that's a public service right there.",Variety,Bob Verini,04/19/2012

It says them with humor and with insight. There are also some moving moments, and eerie moments that can pass for moving. The play is without question worth seeing, the reward of doing so the satisfaction not only of crackling theater but of keeping up with what’s happening in the culture.

Harvey,8,"Hope Is a Thing With Long, Fuzzy Ears","The Pulitzer Prize committee may have never erred more egregiously than it did in favoring “Harvey” over Tennessee Williams’s first masterwork, “The Glass Menagerie.” But handled with care, as it has been in this Roundabout Theater Company production, this winsome comedy about a lovable eccentric can cast a satisfying spell. Mr. Ellis’s amiable staging—which features expert supporting performances from Jessica Hecht, as Elwood’s dithery sister, Veta, and Charles Kimbrough, as the eminent psychiatrist she hopes will lock her troublesome brother up for good—strikes the right, gently dizzy tone. Most important, Mr. Parsons carries the weight of a role immortalized on film by the inimitable James Stewart as lightly as Elwood does the hat and coat he keeps on hand for his furry companion. Mr. Parsons possesses in abundance the crucial ability to project an ageless innocence without any visible effort: no small achievement for an actor in these knowing times.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,06/14/2012
Harvey,8,NY Review: 'Harvey',"Elwood is a role that has attracted a host of stars, from its originator, the vaudevillian Frank Fay, to Stewart, who replaced Fay in the original Broadway run and starred in the 1950 film, and Art Carney, of ""The Honeymooners"" fame, who played it on TV in 1958. Jim Parsons isn't much like any of those gentlemen, but he makes Elwood his own in an impressive turn. Chase describes Elwood as ""dignified"" yet ""dreamy,"" ""benign"" yet ""serious,"" and Parsons takes her at her word with wonderful stylization while adding just the slightest touch of dry humor. He is so convincing in his give-and-take with Harvey that we almost begin to see the mischievous sprite. Parsons stresses Elwood's concern for others and generosity of spirit, undergirding it with a touch of steel. He's terrific.",Backstage,Erik Haagensen,06/14/2012
Harvey,8,'Harvey': Don't mind the invisible rabbit,"If the term summer stock were not so besmirched with straw hats and desperation, the Roundabout's production, starring the sweetly formidable Jim Parsons, could be thought of as Broadway's excellent summer vacation. Parsons, in a small but significant stretch from the haute-geek he plays on TV's ""The Big Bang Theory,"" does not shirk from creating an Elwood P. Dowd who stands tall yet somehow separate from the long, bright shadow cast by Jimmy Stewart in the 1950 movie. Director Scott Ellis has surrounded Parsons with an appropriately fine assortment of character actors to play dithering dowagers, dotty psychiatrists and incredulous family members...Especially impressive is Jessica Hecht, much admired in drama, turning into a multileveled, delightfully goofy comic as Elwood's impatient, financially dependent cousin.",Newsday,Linda Winer,06/14/2012
Harvey,7,"Delusion, Repression—and Comedy","Jim Parsons, the star of ""The Big Bang Theory,"" is playing Elwood, which says much—maybe everything—about why the Roundabout is doing ""Harvey."" Big guns from Hollywood, after all, are an even bigger part of what keeps Broadway afloat these days. It doesn't matter whether or not they know anything about stage acting: All they have to do to sell tickets by the shovelful is show up. Mr. Parsons, who has plenty of stage experience, does much more than that, but he's still giving the kind of affably superficial performance that you'd expect from a network sitcom star. Sure, it's unfair to compare him to one of the best screen actors of the 20th century, but it's also inevitable, and the gentle, wistful gravity that Mr. Stewart brought to the role is nowhere to be found in Mr. Parsons's once-over-lightly interpretation.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,06/14/2012

He's perfectly suited to reprise Stewart's role from the 1950 film version of Harvey…Alas, the same might be said of Scott Ellis' oddly sluggish production, which lurches from scene to scene when it should be bunny-hopping briskly along.

Harvey,7,Broadway review: ‘Harvey',"Chase wrote a tight plot with characters so richly defined, they could be played as real people or as cartoons, as most are in Scott Ellis' tidy Roundabout Theatre Company production. Ellis honors the play's smooth narrative arc with a seamless staging on David Rockwell's impressive set, which turns back and forth from Dowd's wood-paneled manse to a glaringly sterile sanitarium…It's good and often silly fun, greatly enriched by Parson's performance.

Jim Parsons has the right earnest, bemused decency as Elwood, making you believe he believes while conversing with what looks like thin air. But Jessica Hecht is strange casting as Veta Louise. Hecht is an excellent actress, but she's best at sensible, analytical roles, not ones that call for being daftly flustered. (The pseudo aristocratic accent she goes for here sounds especially forced.) Fortunately, she--like the whole production--gets better in the second half, especially when she unravels while noticing, to her dismay, that her mother's portrait on the wall has been covered by one involving Harvey.",Village Voice,Michael Musto,06/14/2012
Harvey,7,REVIEW: ‘Harvey’ rematerializes on Broadway,"Harder heads than mine may find “Harvey” to be a trifle sappy in sentiment, but I find it endearing, especially when the comedy is served so well by Ellis and his excellent actors. Never intimating that his character is a lush, Parsons lends the gentlemanly Elwood a calm and slightly dreamy manner that contrasts against the other characters, who more or less are driven into a frenzy by his chum Harvey’s unseen presence.

As an old-fashioned architect, he can’t be faulted here. But he doesn’t furnish his rooms so that they feel genuinely lived in. The masterly director Daniel Sullivan (who also staged “Proof”) and a very good cast that also includes Margaret Colin and Boyd Gaines do their best to bring flesh to what remains essentially an annotated outline.

As I said to my friend as we left the theater in the midst of a gathering spring storm, ""It's not a bad play for a rainy Sunday afternoon."" A good deal of the credit goes to Sullivan's finely acted production, which in addition to Lithgow (ideally cast as the peremptory patrician), features a first-rate ensemble.",LA Times,Charles McNulty,04/25/2012
The Columnist,8,STAGE REVIEW The Columnist,"Despite Lithgow's powerful performance, The Columnist spends a surprisingly long amount of time away from its titular character. There are tangential scenes set in Saigon, backstage at the Pulitzer Prizes, and a lengthy subplot involving journalist David Halberstam (Stephen Kunken) — the muckraking, Jewish counterpoint to Alsop's increasingly obsolescent country-club socialite.

The Columnist,8,Theater Review: Get Me Rewrite on The Columnist,"Alsop helped cajole and bully first John Kennedy, then Lyndon Johnson, deeper and deeper into the Vietnam War.

Or with KGB threats to publish evidence of his “degeneracy”? Or just his unshakably aristocratic worldview? (“We don’t give two shits what they want to read! We tell them what they need to know!”) In The Columnist, playwright David Auburn engages these questions ever so gingerly, ultimately giving Alsop a bit too wide a berth. He wants the man wreathed in mystery—a great dying-WASP tragedy—but he also wants to convey a Britannica’s worth of specific didja-know historical info: The dialogue is smart and sharp enough, but The Columnist, in toto, feels both didactically chalky and oddly evasive.",NY Magazine,Scott Brown,04/25/2012

The Columnist,7,The Columnist: Theater Review,"Equipped with arrogance, fearsome intellect, vitriol and the punctilious armor of a man forced to live in denial, John Lithgow fully inhabits influential journalist Joseph Alsop in The Columnist. Director Daniel Sullivan brings his customary clarity and focus to a series of pithy scenes that place Alsop near the center of some important chapters in 20th century American political life. But while this is a potentially fascinating character study with no shortage of meaty material, playwright David Auburn hasn’t managed to shape it into a drama with a discernible through-line.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/25/2012
The Columnist,7,Review: Engaging 'Columnist' on Broadway rarely goes beyond what's fit to print,"""The Columnist"" doesn't manage to make Alsop's particular case, and, granted, he was a particular case, quite enough of a metaphor for the American moment. We're not allowed to feel and think beyond the biography. That issue is exacerbated by classy but very careful and gentle production from director Dan Sullivan that uses dignified, measured transitions to capture the affluence of Alsop's upper-class, Georgetown milieu, but never allows Lithgow or his foes to fully let loose. For sure, these were wound-tight personalities dedicated to propriety, and this articulate cast surely captures that element of the national discourse. Still, one finds oneself wanting a couple more of these very civilized scenes — especially those between Lithgow and Margaret Colin, who plays Susan Mary Alsop, an in-name-only wife — to descend into staccato rage.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/25/2012
The Columnist,6,The Columnist,"John Lithgow is a natural for this kind of role, and he may be doing his best stage work. His Alsop is a vigorous, contradictory figure, brimming with intellectual fire and just a dash of camp. Lithgow has always combined great strength (physical or mental) with a touching vulnerability, an almost girlish embarrassment flickering somewhere behind the eyes. As self-righteously monstrous as Alsop grows, Lithgow never completely loses our sympathy. And yet Auburn never gets us inside his subject...The world doesn’t need more monologues, but you wish Auburn had told this story with a single voice. Let’s call this Auburn’s sophomore slump. And hope he makes his next deadline before another decade passes.",Time Out NY,David Cote,04/25/2012
The Columnist,6,Theater Review: 'The Columnist',"Static and slow, the play would benefit from some reworking. Nevertheless, Dan Sullivan's detailed production benefits from an excellent cast of stage veterans. Lithgow fits easily in the role.

The Lyons,9,NY Review: 'The Lyons',"In a Broadway season full of transfers from Off-Broadway, Nicky Silver's ""The Lyons"" comes charging onto the Great White Way with a savage roar that is simultaneously a scream of pain and a shout of dark laughter. The script has been trimmed somewhat, and the performances and staging have been pitched slightly broader to accommodate the larger house after a successful run at the Vineyard Theatre, but this merciless comedy of a dysfunctional family dealing with mortality and regret is still an intimate and scary examination of how we cope with loneliness and disappointment.

The Lyons,8,Waiting for Dad to Die: Laughs Pile Up,"Sure, from a distance the title characters of “The Lyons,” the Nicky Silver play that opened on Monday night at the Cort Theater in a production starring the fabulous Linda Lavin, are hilarious as they kick the ego out of one another.

The Lyons,8,The Lyons: Theater Review,"...thanks to the complexities of Lavin’s characterization, the penetrating insights of Silver’s writing, and the imperceptible calibrations of Mark Brokaw’s crisp production, Rita is no mere monster of insensitivity. The degree to which she accepts responsibility for her children being “sad and unforgiving,” and for her own entrapment in a 40-year marriage to a man she never loved is clear. That doesn’t mean, however, that she’s atoning. Silver’s play doesn’t go in for such banalities. But in addition to being a maestro of timing with her comic delivery, Lavin has a peerless ability to humanize her characters even while exposing their lacerating edges.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/23/2012
The Lyons,8,Broadway review: ‘The Lyons’,"“The Lyons” is blessed with Mark Brokaw’s nimble direction and a cast that mines all the dissonance as if each little imbroglio comes popping hot from a precious nugget. Lavin is the outright leader in this — everything from her New York accent to the world-weary mini-whine in her voice to the roll of her eyes says this is a woman who knows her mind and wants nothing to do with anyone else’s. The wonderful Dick Latessa is her dying husband; even though Silver gives him far too many cheap barbs based solely on high-level cursing, Latessa is a pro with the know-how to land them...“The Lyons” works best as lashing comedy, less as a meaningful look at anything. And there’s enough funny lashing to leave an audience happily smarting.",Philadelphia Inquirer,Howard Shapiro,04/23/2012
The Lyons,8,Theater review: Linda Lavin in ‘The Lyons’ on Broadway,"Death looms large in Nicky Silver’s Broadway play, “The Lyons,” a caustic and canny comedy about family dysfunction packed with surprises that are alternately hilarious, tragic and absurd. Emerging just as big as the Grim Reaper in her ferociously funny and constantly compelling star turn is Linda Lavin, who plays a wife (and soon-to-be-widow) and mother whose bark and bite can wreak havoc. And has.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,04/23/2012
The Lyons,8,You’ll be Lavin it,"Nicky Silver’s “The Lyons” — which opened on Broadway last night after a hit run at the Vineyard — is packed with such sweet nothings.

The Lyons,7,The Lighter Side of Cancer,"One of the reasons we expect so much out of Broadway shows is that they cost so much to see. Nicky Silver's ""The Lyons,"" which transferred to Broadway this week, is a clever little dysfunctional-family comedy that contains at least twice its fair share of laughs. Though it's more than a bit of a mess, ""The Lyons"" has its moments, and Linda Lavin, the star, is in sensational form. Off Broadway, that amounted to a passable bargain—but is it really worth $126.50 to see an amusing but inconsistent show? All I can tell you is that despite its extreme unevenness, ""The Lyons"" is never boring.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,04/23/2012
The Lyons,7,Theater Review: 'The Lyons',"As a dysfunctional family drama, ""The Lyons"" is hardly as penetrating as ""Clybourne Park"" or ""Other Desert Cities."" But as directed by Mark Brokaw, it's entertaining and full of witty one-liners. Lavin delivers a wild performance marked by wide facial expressions, an often screeching voice and kooky personality. She is nicely supported by an emaciated Latessa, tortured Grant and seemingly helpless Esper.",amNY,Matt Windman,04/23/2012
The Lyons,7,"The Lyons Review: Linda Lavin, Broader on Broadway","On second viewing now that it has transferred to Broadway, I find the performances broader and the play slighter...One can suspect these changes were effected to accommodate the more mainstream theatergoers of Broadway, but, even if so, I am not scandalized. What worked in “The Lyons” downtown still works. The acting still could not be better. Linda Lavin gives a nuanced (if louder) performance that should not be missed. She may initially seem little more than a quirky caricature but she winds up something more, different, thought-provoking.",Faster Times,Jonathan Mandell,04/23/2012
The Lyons,7,STAGE REVIEW The Lyons,"But outside the confines of that fluorescent-lit, pressure-packed, disinfected room, The Lyons feels ill at ease. Though Silver has wisely excised Lisa's rambling Alcoholics Anonymous monologue since the late 2011 Off Broadway run, an extended apartment-showing scene lingers at the top of act two; and on second viewing, it seems less compatible with the witty whirlwind we've just witnessed. (It actually feels like a short play in itself, like one that might appear at the EST Marathon mentioned in the scene — 10 points for audience members who get that inside-NYC-theater reference.) It does provide a convenient route back to the hospital, where comic order is, thankfully, restored. But there's only so much struggling-actor shtick a viewer can take, even from a hunky blond broad-shouldered broker (Gregory Wooddell). Besides, that all-white apartment could really use a Rita Lyons makeover.""",Entertainment Weekly,Melissa Rose Bernardo,04/23/2012

Godspell,7,Broadway's 'Godspell' revival a lively affair,"""Godspell,"" which has long been a standard show put on in colleges and high schools, captures the best of the old and embraces the new: At intermission, some cast members stay on stage for the traditional boogie with the audience - yes, free wine is handed out - and yet this new version has the parable about Tribute to Caesar illustrated by Jesus putting a coin in a tip jar. Costumes by Miranda Hoffman remain true to that dynamic, with the use of multicolored pants and suspenders as a nod to the hippy past, and prom dresses, sneakers, a bowling shirt and leopard prints a sign of the new. It all ends badly, of course - for Jesus, not the show. The second act is a bummer, though Jesus' death is sensitively handled. But as his followers carry his body away - their faces glisten with sweat and they are visibly moved - it's clear that ""Godspell"" has anointed a new group of Broadway stars and we are the richer for it.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,11/07/2011

They dance the Macarena, shoot confetti at us from pop guns and, in one of the better numbers, jump on trampolines revealed under trap doors.

Godspell,6,Theater Review: Is Godspell Worthy?,"The music's been given a once-over, as well, with sometimes radically tricked-out new undercarriages: Gone is the granola folk of ""God Save the People,"" replaced by an almost- reggae lilt; ""We Beseech Thee""'s gospel revival has been canned in favor of neo-country (and is now performed on, gulp, trampolines). And yet, for all that's changed, it's still much the same spell. ""Bless the Lord"" is still the first number to bring down the house (especially as performed by the redoubtable Lindsay Mendez), and incandescent individual performances (Telly Leung's magnificent ""All Good Gifts,"" for example) elevate songs that might, in less expert hands, show their age.",NY Magazine,Scott Brown,11/07/2011
Godspell,6,NY Review: 'Godspell',"Instead of allowing the concept, of a childlike Christ leading a gaggle of puppyish disciples through the parables, to stand on its own, Goldstein has added a plethora of gimmicks, including audience-participation charades and Pictionary, as well as topical references to everything from Donald Trump to Facebook to Occupy Wall Street. When the cast hauls out the glitter cannons at the end of the first act, you know they're trying too hard. ""Godspell"" is a popular choice for high school and community theaters because it has a simple, laid-back charm and opportunities for the cast of 10 to stand out, with each receiving at least one lead vocal part in the bouncy, infectious score, here rocked up and amped by orchestrator Michael Holland and sound designer Andrew Keister. Goldstein would have done better to reduce the volume and let the young ensemble rather than the jazzy staging take the spotlight.",Backstage,David Sheward,11/07/2011
Godspell,5,A Vision of Spirituality Returns to Broadway,"Go easy on the caffeine if you're heading to the Broadway revival of ""Godspell"" that opened on Monday night at the Circle in the Square. The cast of this relentlessly perky production of the 1971 musical, which transformed parables from the Gospels into a series of singable teaching moments, virtually never stops bopping, bouncing, bounding, even trampolining across the stage and up the aisles of the theater. It's like being trapped in a summer camp rec room with a bunch of kids who have been a little too reckless with the Red Bull.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,11/07/2011
Godspell,5,Godspell,"Strongest aspect of the affair is the casting: This ""Godspell"" is especially well sung. Standing out are Lindsay Mendez (on ""Bless the Lord"" and elsewhere) and Telly Leung (on ""All Good Gifts""). The one big letdown comes from Hunter Parrish, the Jesus of the occasion. Parrish has an innocent smile, big blonde hair, and plenty of teeth; he doesn't look like a Ken doll, exactly, but he sings like one. Wallace Smith, as John/Judas, is marginally stronger but not up to the level of the ensemble. One of the surprising bright spots is the entr'acte reprise of ""Learn Your Lessons Well,"" sung by Leung (at piano) with Mendez and Smith. Yes, there is an audience for this ""Godspell,"" and perhaps they can be reached. But the strengths of the original have been so weighted down by mirthless improvements that it makes for a very long two hours.",Variety,Steven Suskin,11/07/2011
Godspell,5,Godspell Is Back: Prepare Ye For My Review,"But the show's switches from goofy to glum are as awkward as ever, and while the Jesus (the surfer-dude-looking Hunter Parrish from Weeds) has a silkily beautiful voice, he can't make the dramatic parts as profound as they want to be.",Village Voice,Michael Musto,11/07/2011
Godspell,4,Godspell: Theater Review,"Prepare ye the way for disappointment. Goldstein approaches it all like a Children's Television Workshop special. Maybe it's appropriate for a show so widely performed in schools, but this feels indeed like a high school production staged by the wacky new drama teacher. (Think Mr. G. on HBO's under-appreciated Summer Heights High.) Christopher Gattelli's choreography also throws a million ideas at the stage in the hope that something sticks. The strength of some of the second-act songs such as ""On the Willows"" ensures that a depth of feeling does eventually coalesce. And the crucifixion is arrestingly staged, albeit with cheesy simulated slo-mo from the disciples during the finale's wailing guitar breaks. But my chief takeaway from this was the tarnishing of a treasured theater memory. Now, let's see how Jesus Christ Superstar holds up in the spring.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,11/07/2011
Godspell,4,Review: Godspell,"Reorchestrated and sound-designed for young, modern ears, this Godspell sounds like a born-again Glee, and several performers have moments to shine (including Uzo Aduba, Telly Leung and the wonderful Lindsay Mendez). Capering through Christopher Gattelli's joyous choreography, on David Korins's continually surprising set, the actors are nothing if not energetic. But for all the copious tributes paid to him, Jesus is a thankless role, and Hunter Parrish is this production's sacrifice to it; with a voice and presence as light as his ultra-blond locks, Parrish preaches softly and wears a creepily forced smile. This is Jesus as Stepford twink, and it's regrettably in keeping with a show that, in its combination of bathos and kitsch, is a model of bad faith.",Time Out NY,Adam Feldman,11/07/2011

Godspell,4,Godspell Review,"Those who already love Schwartz's score will probably bounce up and down with them, aided by a band that is cleverly sprinkled throughout the audience.

It’s affable entertainment with many funny moments, but not enough to disguise the mechanical structure and whiff of moldiness of its infidelity-interruptus plot...Tillinger guides the action along at a steady trot, but the material loses steam in the second act, sputtering toward a laborious denouement. Instead of the chaos hinging on increasingly elaborate contretemps, it replays variations on the same theme to diminishing returns. There are laughs, for sure, but compared to the truly inventive farce of One Man, Two Guvnors, playing a couple of blocks away, there’s also a hint of fatigue.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/26/2012

Portraying an actress giving the audition of a lifetime, Ms. Arianda is giving the first must-see performance of the Broadway season, a bravura turn that burns so brightly you can almost feel the heat on your face. ... I'm not sure Mr. Ives himself has settled firmly on a resolution to the play's central mystery - the motives and identity of the elusive Vanda - but who cares? With the commanding Ms. Arianda giving a performance of such intoxicating allure, ""Venus in Fur"" provides a seriously smart and very funny stage seminar on the destabilizing nature of sexual desire: vanilla-flavored, kink-festooned or anything in between.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,11/08/2011

She just happens to have the same name as the play's character, knows the lines and brought perfect thrift-shop costumes (by Anita Yavich). For almost two nonstop hours, Arianda makes whiplash changes from gawky hopeful to scary siren -- with stops at elegant countess, Jerry Lewis, a deadly spider, a skinny duck, a classic comedian, a grand tragedian, an actress in a revenge fantasy and a goddess who knows the power of bare thigh above a high boot.",Newsday,Linda Winer,11/08/2011

Venus in Fur,8,Broadway Review: ‘Venus in Fur’,"Fiery, intense and so sexy you could sweat, the production of David Ives' new Venus in Fur, a sensation when it ran Off-Broadway last year, opened in a remounted production Tuesday on Broadway. Much of the heat comes from a living generator, the actress Nina Arianda, who reprises the role she created downtown in the original production. There's a booster to this furnace - the Broadway actor and film star Hugh Dancy, who is essentially her prey.

She has since had small roles in ""The Good Wife"" on TV and Woody Allen's movie ""Midnight in Paris,"" and now, at 27, Arianda is back in ""Venus in Fur,"" this time on Broadway. She is just as good as she was. Her co-star Hugh Dancy is better than the actor he replaced, hard-charging when on the offense, mesmerizing in his submission, persuasive as a European because he is one.

Her ability to go from dumb to powerful (also on show last season in the Broadway revival of ""Born Yesterday"") is remarkable and her physicality here, from her Noo Yawk accent to crossing her legs like a longshoreman in a frilly dress, is thrilling.

Venus in Fur,8,NY Review: 'Venus in Fur',"But Arianda remains the engine that drives this intermissionless thrill ride, revving on all cylinders as she progresses from desperate actor to imperious seductress to all-powerful goddess. She gets an added fuel injection from her new acting partner. Dancy adds depths to Thomas that the role's originator, Wes Bentley, failed to find. When Vanda begins to step out of the script and literally take control of the situation, Dancy's eyes light up with a weird combination of fear and anticipation. His Thomas is scared out of his wits by the turn of events, but he's also a little excited. Part of him wants to be dominated. This causes the interplay between the two characters to become more heated and dangerous.

Chalk that up to helmer Walter Bobbie's savvy re-casting of one of the players in this two-hander: In his confident turn as a modern-day playwright-director keen on exploring the sado-masochistic sexual dynamic, Hugh Dancy gives hot co-star Nina Arianda someone substantial to play to.

If Venus in Fur had been a one-act, I would have rushed to assign it five stars. In saying this, I realise that I am adhering to the standard evaluation of Ives: adept at miniatures. But that judgment is no more disparaging than to say that Alice Munro excels at short stories. Once Ives introduces subplots from Vanda and Thomas's offstage lives - has Thomas's fiancée dispatched Vanda to the audition to test his fidelity? - the narrative begins to sag.

Leap of Faith,7,Leap of Faith: Theater Review,"The stage musical improves on the original simply by settling on a point of view. But despite Raul Esparza’s hard-working lead performance and some rousing Gospel numbers from Alan Menken and Glenn Slater, the story remains stubbornly unappealing. Opening on Broadway the same week as the slavish screen-to-stage transplant of Ghost, the musical Leap of Faith earns points by at least rethinking its source for another medium, often in smart ways, too. Adapting her screenplay, Janus Cercone has collaborated with playwright Warren Leight (a Tony winner for Side Man, and showrunner on Law & Order: SVU) to clarify plot themes, redefining some characters while inventing or excising others. The resulting show has more heart than the movie, but still not enough.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/26/2012
Leap of Faith,7,STAGE REVIEW Leap of Faith,"Competently directed by Christopher Ashley with some lively choreography by Sergio Trujillo, the show occasionally grapples with an interesting question: Can a seriously flawed man still be a vessel for God's will, even for the miraculous? But while Esparza has a confident, commanding stage presence, he doesn't seem oily enough in his early scenes to make his second-act moment of reckoning pay off...The show does brush on a thin veneer of documentary-style exposé — we see how a sham healer gathers telling details about his congregation to exploit during his revival service — but otherwise the story never strays from its highly conventional path. And for Broadway veterans, that path should seem especially familiar. Leap of Faith is The Music Man meets 110 in the Shade, with an overly pat ending that undercut's the plot's refreshing ambivalence about the path to salvation.",Entertainment Weekly,Thom Greier,04/26/2012
Leap of Faith,6,Review: 'Leap of Faith' jumps around too much,"The last musical of the official Broadway season comes into town like a huckster promising salvation. But it's the show itself that needs saving.There's a strong musical somewhere in ""Leap of Faith,"" which stars a soulful Raul Esparza and has some of Alan Menken's best songs. But what opened Thursday at The St. James Theatre is sometimes confusing in its tone. Like its main character – the devious faith healer Rev. Jonas Nightingale, ready to scam residents of a down-and-out Kansas town – the musical is hard to pin down. There's too much misdirection.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,04/26/2012
Leap of Faith,6,Ersatz Antique,"What ""Leap of Faith"" lacks are sweat and heart, the absence of which will be bothersome only if you permit yourself to imagine how this well-oiled applause machine might have run had its creators taken the plot seriously. Real emotions, raw and hurtful, are at stake in ""Leap of Faith,"" and on occasion they bob to the surface, as in the scene in which a frumpy, desperately unhappy woman (well played by Dierdre Friel) drops her wedding ring in the collection basket. Adam Guettel or Michael John LaChiusa would have made the whole show as gripping as that one short scene.

They’ll admire its tunes by master songwriter Alan Menken (you always leave the theater humming his music), and its attractive and talented cast led by the superb Raúl Esparza as the preacher, Jonas Nightingale...“Leap of Faith” is about a phony who employs the cheap trick.

Leap of Faith,6,Leap of Faith Review: Unbelievable on Broadway,"Does anybody believe that “Leap of Faith” is trying to convert all of us atheists and Jews in the audience? It’s an ersatz experience, emotionally and musically. Menken’s 17 appealing songs (Including three show-stoppers, “Step Into the Light,” “Are You on the Bus?” and “Leap of Faith”) are mostly good, ersatz gospel music. Sergio Trujillo’s choreography is mostly energetic swaying in gospel robes, which mimic the movements of an actual gospel choir. (The set, mostly a rotating revival tent, is as fake as the story.)...Should lovers of gospel music pay $100+ to see “Leap of Faith?” Why not? But they could have the authentic gospel experience at one of the many churches in New York City with gospel choirs.

Leap of Faith,6,Theater Review: Leap of Faith Falls Short,"On its third director and its second book, the slightly road-worn Leap of Faith vaults over a chasm of skepticism—and stops precisely three quarters of the way across. It’s not a terrible show—Elmer Gantry-meets-The Music Man is certainly a winning stage-musical conceit—but it's a persistently confused one, in tone, content, and mood. Ostensibly a straightforward inspirational dramedy (sporting a straightforward set of smoothly toothsome Alan Menken tunes, sprightly recyclings of his trademark pop yearnings and gospel pastiche), the show aims to be hiply clued-in and folksily naïve all at once. The result is a sermon in song that’s rousing enough, but also instantly evanescent: Believers and unbelievers alike are welcomed (nay, bullied) to clap along, and they’ll leave baptized in freshets of energetically manipulative pop-Broadway melody, but the effect evaporates fast. Leap feels like the not-awful, not-wonderful product of a long series of compromises.",NY Magazine,Scott Brown,04/26/2012
Leap of Faith,5,"Sneaky Preacher, Without a Prayer","Praise the Lord, and pass the amphetamines. “Leap of Faith,” which opened on Thursday night at the St. James Theater, uses the religious revival meeting as both its subject and its form.

How many phony preachers distribute money to the audiences they plan to fleece? It makes about as much sense as this ersatz musical does, which, like its cinematic source, is a compendium of formulaic characters and clichéd situations all too obviously cribbed from better and more original works.

Leap of Faith,5,'Leap of Faith' requires a major one,"The crisis of faith in Kansas is awkwardly framed with a revival meeting on Broadway a year later.

There is so much emotion in Larry Bird’s normally stoic face during the game that I nearly burst into tears. But there is a catch. It is Larry Bird’s actual face up on a screen, one of many video snippets that are used in “Magic/Bird.” Virtually nothing that the live performers do on the stage at the Longacre Theater has anywhere near the impact.

Seminar,10,Review: Seminar,"There’s always danger when writers lampoon the publishing world: You never believe their wünderkinds are so wonderful, and they tend to burlesque bad writing beyond credibility. The acid test comes when someone reads aloud a passage that is purportedly genius or dreck. Rebeck wisely curtails recitation of manuscripts. Instead we watch as Rickman’s Leonard—being paid $20K to teach a ten-week intensive course at the Upper West Side apartment of Kate (Rabe)—as he pages through student submissions. A curl of the lip, a twitch of the eyebrow, a flare of the nostrils: These nonverbal signals speak volumes.

Of course this mélange of feelings, magnificently orchestrated by Mr. Rickman, is arrived at after Leonard has only glanced at the first couple of pages of a vast manuscript. But for the first time I felt an authentic rush of pleasure and the exhilaration of being reminded that in theater, art comes less from landing lines than in finding what lies between them.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,11/20/2011
Seminar,7,NY Review: 'Seminar',"There are consolations, chief among them Rickman, who wisely understates Leonard's prickly intelligence, colossal ego, and enormous self-loathing. The actor is absolutely delicious as Leonard slides a metaphorical knife in so smoothly and off-handedly that the victim can't even feel it. Watch Rickman as Leonard delivers a blistering assessment of a student's bleak future. Only gradually does it become apparent that the teacher is speaking about himself. This is the kind of part that could have been played with fireworks, but Rickman sounds subtle and beautiful grace notes.

Not the debased, bilious language the spills from most stages these day, but words that matter, that touch the soul.

She never stops wrestling.",Bloomberg,Jeremy Gerard,01/26/2012
Wit,9,STAGE REVIEW Wit,"Wit is about so much more than one woman's disease. It's about knowledge, ignorance, humanity, love; 'the play is about simplicity and complications,' schoolteacher Edson has said...Fearless doesn't even begin to describe Nixon's performance. She never leaves the stage — the same stage, incidentally, where she delivered her Tony-winning performance in Rabbit Hole in 2006. And from her 'Hi!

Wit,9,Wit: Theater Review,"A deserving winner of the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, Margaret Edson’s Wit is a work of delicately calibrated opposites. It pits detached clinical observation on one side against raw human emotion on the other, while somehow making dry humor and wrenching pathos travel hand in hand. In Lynne Meadow’s unerringly focused staging for Manhattan Theatre Club, and above all in Cynthia Nixon’s shattering performance, that balancing act is rendered with piercing accuracy.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,01/26/2012
Wit,9,Broadway Review: ‘Wit’,"Wit is, of course, scary - when is cancer not? But it's also funny - very funny - which is part of its triumph; we understand the pain and the process so much more clearly through the main character's witty vision. Nixon delivers those insights, in a play the character has constructed about her life with cancer, with a shaved head and no eyebrows - her character is on the highest dose of chemo possible. Emma Thompson shaved her scalp for Mike Nichols' tele-play of Wit on HBO (2001), as do actresses in regional theater. Nixon's normally expressive face is even more so, with a baseball cap perched on her high forehead",Philadelphia Inquirer,Howard Shapiro,01/26/2012
Wit,9,Review: Wit,"Having missed Kathleen Chalfant in a role that she was apparently born to play—Dr. Vivian Bearing in Margaret Edson’s powerful medical drama, Wit—I can’t weigh her performance against Cynthia Nixon’s in the Manhattan Theatre Club revival. But it is easy to imagine that Chalfant’s patrician starch and throaty low register perfectly conveyed a literature professor who can anatomize verse as easily as she verbally flays her students. Nixon has an innate warmth and coltishness that works against her, and she struggles in the first third of Lynne Meadow’s production to project sufficient froideur and hauteur. Still, it’s a testament to this remarkable play and Nixon’s skill that we ultimately believe her as the cancer-stricken teacher. Believing, we also weep at her fate.",Time Out NY,David Cote,01/26/2012

(The director is greatly aided by Santo Loquasto's mobile hospital-lecture-hall set and Peter Kaczorowski's unsparing lighting.) There are traces of Nixon's controlling and borderline-bitchy Miranda, from the salacious and saucy HBO series, in her Vivian. But there are also a keener intellect and a sharper—you'll excuse the expression—wit.

More specifically, the clutch of top-flight tunes written by book writer–lyricist Alan Jay Lerner and composer Burton Lane for their problematic 1965 Broadway musical comedy about reincarnation, ""On a Clear Day You Can See Forever."" Those siren songs have lured re-conceiver–director Michael Mayer right onto the rocks in this misguided retooling attempt. Mayer and current book writer Peter Parnell keep trying to jam them into a new story and characters that manifestly don't want them, diminishing the very thing Mayer and Parnell supposedly value.

On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,5,On A Clear Day You Can See Forever Review,"His fans might feel let down, but it is difficult to call the new Broadway production of “On A Clear Day You Can See Forever” a complete disappointment. That is because even its director, Michael Mayer, has said the original 1965 Broadway show was unsuccessful, and its plot “extremely problematic.” (A reviewer in 1965 called it “labored and creaky.”) So how can you be completely disappointed when expectations are so low? Long in love with Burton Lane’s score, Mayer decided he would revamp everything else, hiring playwright Peter Parnell to rewrite Alan Jay Lerner’s book. The director’s efforts have yielded any number of satisfactions: The songs are tuneful, the singers know what they are doing, there are some amusing moments; as a bonus, there is even something of a gay twist that already has disturbed a troglodyte or two.

When the star of the new Broadway version, Harry Connick Jr., starts to lecture, you're immediately put in mind of Al Gore. The craggy crooner, who plays opposite the gorgeously voiced Chicago star Jessie Mueller in a troubled and perplexing show that is hardly the best vehicle for her Broadway debut, has a physical resemblance to the handsome former vice president, and he also embodies some of Gore's signature stiffness. But among many inconvenient truths in this revival, with a radically retooled new book by Peter Parnell and direction and reconception by Michael Mayer, Connick — the big star on the marquee — is just not given a character or persona within which he can rest easy.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,12/11/2011

The show’s harmless Broadway incarnation, energetically coached by Dan Knechtges, is in several ways superior to its humbler predecessor: The male cast has upped its game, the ladies stay strong, and Douglas Carter Beane has given a better backstory to his title character (Murin), who organizes a chastity strike to spur her boyfriend (Segarra) and his apathetic college team to victory. But the plot remains silly, the music humdrum and the characters trite; the Latino figures have little but accents to define them, and not even the imposing Liz Mikel can rescue her weary-wise prostitute character from the sassy molasses of big-black-lady stereotype.

And there's no good explanation for why Clyde's deeply religious sister-in-law (Melissa Van der Schyff, who has a lovely second-act ballad, 'That's What You Call a Dream') joins her husband on the lam. The production's biggest success may be Aaron Rhyne's projections, which include vintage photos of the real-life models for the characters on stage — including their mug shots.

In attempting to give Charles Addams' macabre characters a life beyond the brilliant single-panel cartoons that appeared for years in The New Yorker, the creators of this schizophrenic musical have made them more audience friendly. But in a perverse way, they're not as much fun.",Associated Press,Michael Kuchwara,04/08/2010

It won't kill you. You'll laugh a lot, though never during the unmemorable songs, which are supposed to be funny but aren't. You're more than likely to spend a considerable part of the evening wondering how much the set cost. And as you depart the theater, you'll probably catch yourself wondering whether it was really, truly worth it to take your kids to a goodish musical whose tickets are so expensive that you can buy an iPad for less than the price of four orchestra seats.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,04/09/2010
The Addams Family,4,The Addams Family,"But in many ways, the show feels wrong. Broadway's instinctive need to entertain seems at odds with the cartoon's low key style. In fact, the last thing you'd expect the tango loving Morticia and Gomez to do is yuk it up for laughs. But that's precisely what's going on for the most part. Andrew Lippa's eclectic score is uneven, featuring a few winning numbers playing on the conceit that normal values are reversed with the Addams' preferring dead things and gloom. But even that's inconsistent as the story inexplicably turns sentimental in spots. Bookwriters Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice of ""Jersey Boys"" fame have come up with a plot right out of ""La Cage Aux Folles."" They've aged daughter Wednesday giving her a boyfriend with conservative parents who the kids invite over for dinner, expecting the Addams' to straighten their act.

What this ""Addams Family"" has is the gloweringly perfect Nathan Lane, who gamely thrusts Gomez's rapier at anything -- or any joke -- that moves.

The Addams Family,3,The Addams Family,"""The Addams Family"" is a musical all dressed up with no place to go. There's one simple reason: Nobody knew why they were writing it. There is no animating purpose to the evening, except to throw well-known characters on stage so the audience can luxuriate in their comforting familiarity. Charles Addams' iconic cartoon creations have been robbed of all subversiveness, something even the 1960s TV series—made in a considerably more socially conservative era—didn't do. The thin wisp of plot—daughter Wednesday wants to marry a ""normal"" boy from Ohio—in Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice's choppy book serves mostly to muddy the comic strip's iconography, and their inclusion of a subplot involving Morticia's fears of aging only compounds the problem. They've also come up with one of the flimsiest excuses for a chorus since Captain Jim romanced Rose Marie in the heyday of operetta.",Back Stage,Erik Haagensen,04/08/2010
The Addams Family,3,The Addams Family,"Besides the recycling, writers Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice (""Jersey Boys"") mangle the Addamses by having Wednesday tell her family to ""act normal"" for the Beinekes.

Ditto Jerry Zaks, a Broadway vet hired to consult after a Chicago tryout. Composer-lyricist Andrew Lippa (""The Wild Party"") has come up with a batch of traditional songs, with no memorable breakouts.

The Addams Family, the hotly anticipated musicalization of Charles Addams' bleakly irresistible cartoons, has survived a troubled tryout in Chicago to take its place as the season's only new family musical on Broadway. The show looks fantastic - charming and dripping with ingenious cartoon grotesquerie. The casting - including Nathan Lane as a lovably ruthless Gomez, Bebe Neuwirth as a diabolically slinky Morticia and Kevin Chamberlin as a gracious nut ball of an Uncle Fester - is as close to ideal as imagination can dream up in the real world. The problem - and it is no small problem - is the material, which, after some giddily twisted one-liners in the first act, burdens the larky darkness with gooey sentiment, a wearying plot and increasingly generic songs by Andrew Lippa that have little or nothing to do with the plot or characters.",Newsday,Linda Winer,04/07/2010
The Addams Family,3,The Addams Family,"Brevity is not one of the qualities of the latest incarnation of The Addams Family. The first act of this new musical comedy is a pleasant, if often mindless and more often vulgar, diversion; certainly the spectacular set and special effects (notably a delightful Venus flytrap puppet) keep us engaged even when the comedy and songs sag. But Act Two proves to be one act too many; it felt as if the show's creators had tired of playing with their toys, and instead left them to flounder on their own within a bottomless pool of cliches drawn from second-rate kids' films, sitcoms, and hackneyed musicals. Nothing interesting or witty happens during this last hour, which is surprising in that it includes three songs that are clearly intended by the producers to be show-stoppers. I was bored and disappointed and left The Addams Family, which I sincerely tried to enjoy, feeling saddened by the squandering of resources that it represents.",nytheatre.com,Martin Denton,04/15/2010
The Addams Family,3,Festering,"In keeping with Addams’s graphic style, Zaks offers some delightfully surreal scenic moments: a tassel cut from the end of a rope scuttles offstage by itself; a giant squid and a monster iguanodon make surprise appearances. Zaks does his best to drive this money train down the bad track it’s laid on. (He replaced the show’s original directing team, Phelim McDermott and Julian Crouch.) The show’s narrative, however, can’t handle Addams’s Grand Guignol edge; the book, written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, stays safely on the outside of Addams’s comic world, looking in. Of all the dark cards in Addams’s hand, the team has picked the weakest one: love. Wednesday, the crossbow-toting Goth, falls for Lucas Beineke (Wesley Taylor), a square from Ohio, whose buttoned-down parents come to dinner at the Addams house: in other words, it’s “The Birdcage” reimagined for Bela Lugosi.

Sure, you make a flashy (if obvious) first impression. But then you’re stuck in the darn thing for the rest of the night, and it’s really, really uncomfortable.

""The Addams Family"" -- this year's answer to the question, How many talented people does it take to screw up a concept? -- marks a significant depressing of an ever-more-degraded standard. It's a new show that, despite its mechanized trickery, feels rickety beyond belief, the 2010 musical version of a series of magazine cartoons from the 1930s, '40s and '50s that became a '60s sitcom that became a '90s Hollywood franchise.

Practically from the moment the curtain parts—courtesy Thing, the bodiless hand—you detect the grim, gray whiff of obligation. The Addams Family, like so many large-scale theatrical entertainments today, feels every inch a Musicalized Property. (To call it a “musical” suggests more joie de mort than the show can muster.) It’s a Broadway spectacular only because it must be, not because any of its creators felt particularly inspired. Alas, one can put the defibrillator paddles to a dead body only so many times before it starts to smoke, and long before the night is over, the air in the Lunt-Fontanne is a gritty haze of unrequited effort. “When you’re an Addams,” the ensemble sings (in an instructive, repetitive, highly unpromising opening number), “you’re happy when your toes are in the mud/You smile a bit the moment you smell blood.” Poe, this ain’t.

Man and Boy,9,Man and Boy,"The Roundabout Theatre Company is presenting a cannily timed revival of this largely forgotten work—a flop in its original 1963 London and Broadway productions—that offers a juicy star turn for Frank Langella. The 73-year-old delivers a mesmerizing performance as Gregor Antonescu, a Romanian financier whose fraudulent empire is on the verge of collapsing. Pursued by both the media and the authorities, he takes refuge in the basement Greenwich Village apartment of his long-estranged son Vasily (Adam Driver), who has taken the new name of Basil Anthony.",ScheckOnTheater,Frank Scheck,10/10/2011
Man and Boy,9,Man and Boy,"It's hard to imagine a more commanding and forceful actor in the city. Langella is such a master manipulator of space and time, it's hard to believe that his character is destined for a semitragic fall.

Man and Boy,9,Man and Boy,"Frank Langella was born to play fabulous monsters like Richard Nixon, Count Dracula, and now, Gregor Antonescu, the international financier beset by ruinous scandal in Terence Rattigan's 1963 drama, ""Man and Boy."" Play is set during the Great Depression, but feels eerily contemporary in its cynical portrayal of industry barons who think nothing of robbing the innocent and endangering the economy with their reckless power games.

Man and Boy,5,An Overleveraged Man and Boy,"Basil lacks his father's diamond-tipped ruthlessness; he's ""soft,"" a condition he tells his saucy American girlfriend Carol (Virginia Kull, doing her best as a one-woman exposition service) that his father equates with being ""queer."" This notion is then borne out, rather literally, in a highly entertaining but largely ridiculous game of insinuation and sexual leverage, in which Antonescu lures a potential merger target, Herries (Zach Grenier), to Basil's grungy Village apartment, and convinces his closeted guest that he's among kindred spirits — indeed, that Basil himself might be “un petit pederaste,” if the price is right. This should be appalling, but, as directed by Tricycle Theatre's Maria Aitken, it's mostly just amusing — the best leg of the show, in fact. Grenier and Langella share a fascinating pas de deux, a battle of body language that's a treat to see. As Antonescu's majordomo Sven, the right-hand man who's expert at pretending not to know what the left hand is doing, Michael Siberry proves himself, once again, the Roundabout's secret weapon and sine qua non. (In just three syllables — perhaps the most spectacularly insincere ""I'm sorry"" ever uttered on any stage or in any medium — Siberry sums up the mendacity of the entire politico-financial apparatus he serves.

Man and Boy,5,"Frankly, Langella’s co-star can’t keep up","Zach Grenier and especially Michael Siberry, terrific as Antonescu's shifty confidant, give excellent support, but there are too many stretches when Langella is left to fend for himself.

Man and Boy,5,Man and Boy,"Having directed a generally well-received West End revival of this play in 2005 with David Suchet as Antonescu, Aitken is perhaps too trusting of the material, which has been shorn here of roughly a half-hour. She pulls together a physically sharp production on a detailed set by Derek McLane that evokes bohemian, pre-gentrified Village living, right down to the rust-stained ceilings. But for a play that ends with one character condemned and another presumably scarred for life, it’s a curiously bloodless affair that leaves little aftertaste.",The Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,10/09/2011
Man and Boy,5,Actors in Command,"Maria Aitken has decently directed a highly competent cast, all of them, however, suffering from not enough to work with.

Man and Boy,3,Man and Boy: On With the Showy,"Some of this last shortcoming might stem from Maria Aitken's mostly apt-looking, but oddly off-kilter production. Faridany doesn't fit any of the clues the script gives Antonescu's wife; Kull and Siberry play effectively but without warmth. Grenier is expectably reliable; Hutchison has apparently been pushed toward caricature. Then there's Driver, one of the most arresting, and maddening, young actors around. His frequent moments of interest here are never sustained; the performance becomes a series of intermittent blurts, a sketch by an artist who doesn't know how to make his lines add up to form a picture.

In fact, the entire cast (which also includes Tom Wopat as Frank Abagnale Sr.) seems to be working very hard to put over the material. Under the direction of Jack O'Brien, though, Catch Me If You Can moves mostly in fits and starts. The first act ends abruptly, without a big production number, and throwaway songs like '(Our) Family Tree' with Brenda and her parents tend to stop the show in its tracks. In the end, you have a rooting interest in both Frank and his cohorts on stage. You want them to get away with just about anything.

Early on, just as he’s finally nabbed in an airport, Frank (Tveit, ruthlessly charming) stops the action and insists on telling the audience his version of the story, against the wishes of the schlumpy but persistent Hanratty (Butz, full-bodied, triumphant). Frank opts for the format of a classic 1960s TV variety show, with sexy dancers, broad comedy and plenty of swinging tunes. But this may not be the best way to tell the story of a teenager who cashed more than $2 million in forged checks and impersonated an airline pilot and a pediatrician. The TV-special approach condenses large amounts of material into a jaunty, episodic structure punctuated by brassy numbers, but it also flattens the relationships—especially the potentially moving father-son bond between Frank and Carl.",Time Out New York,David Cote,04/11/2011

And Mitchell's choreography puts a vigorous period-appropriate spin on every number. As Hanratty, Butz (a Tony winner for Dirty Rotten Scoundrels) does nuanced work balancing the jaded, paunchy slob with the wisecracking professional, driven in his quest to catch Frank yet plagued by the melancholy awareness that his job is his life.

Not that Catch Me If You Can (* * ½ out of four), the new Broadway show based on the aforementioned film and autobiography of the same name, is a dud. Boasting a score by the famously witty team of Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman and a book by Terrence McNally, Catch Me is too ambitious and stylish in its efforts to entertain and move us to induce boredom.

A large reason may be the role of the hero, who is, after all, a cipher - a faker, a fraud, a man who is whatever we assume him to be. Beneath the pilot's uniform or doctor's white coat, there's little but a smile and a wink. ""Blink your eyes and I'll be gone,"" he sings in one song. And he's right: He leaves nothing that resonates behind. Played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the film, this time the role of Frank Abagnale Jr. has been handed over to Aaron Tveit.

Catch Me If You Can,4,Adaptation could've stuck more closely to the script,"Given the way that style, racy and uninhibited though it may be, pervades so much of O'Brien's production, it makes it much harder to buy in emotionally to the themes that the musical brings up more successfully in Act 2. Frankly, the show gets caught between worlds. It doesn't want to fully embrace the caustic ""Chicago""-style edge -- aside from Mitchell's choreographic pastiche, Shaiman's varied score has a typically romantic heart, and the lead actor, Tveit, is more rooted in sweetness and charm than edge. The show also has a powerful and very traditional 11 o'clock number for Kerry Butler, who plays Frank's eventual love, nurse Brenda Strong. But Butler's vocal emotions, rich and strong as they surely feel in this terrific Shaiman melody, ""Fly, Fly Away,"" seem as curiously out of place as her uncertain performance, mostly because we never see the two youngsters actually falling in love.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,04/10/2011
Catch Me If You Can,4,Scamming as Fast as He Can,"The script also draws blunt parallel lines between Frank, the pursued, and Carl, the pursuer, a work-obsessed loner. They turn out to have a lot more in common than you might suspect (except that you do, from the beginning), and they are each dutifully given songs to explain how and why. The flashy musical numbers definitely emerge from the plot, just as they are supposed to do in your basic organic musical, but they sometimes have the chalky flavor of audio-visual aids. The notion of Frank as a little boy lost limits the performance of Mr. Tveit, who was terrific as the mother-haunting son in ""Next to Normal."" He has intense presence, for sure, and a bright, blasting voice (though it belongs more to the age of ""American Idol"" than ""American Bandstand""). But his performance is ultimately one-note, all shine and no shadows.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,04/10/2011
Catch Me If You Can,3,Clumsy 'Catch' fumbles,"""Catch Me If You Can"" makes Abagnale a sympathetic figure guilty mainly of charming everybody. Tveit is handsome and sings well, but overuses his Colgate smile and lacks the pizazz necessary to sell the snake oil. This Frank is a junior, all right: many personas but little personality. Butz, on the other hand, has charisma to spare -- which is saying something, since he puts the ""ratty"" back in Hanratty. His body hunched at an angle, a greasy-looking hat perched on his head, he creates a fully rounded character, and displays unfailing musical-comedy flair.",New York Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,04/10/2011
Catch Me If You Can,3,'Catch Me' fumbles at Neil Simon Theatre,"News that the guys from ""Hairspray"" and ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" were making a musical based on the movie ""Catch Me If You Can"" raised a couple of intriguing -- also daunting -- questions. How? And why? That is, how could songs, dances and a Broadway stage add to the plot-heavy adventures of a real-life teen con man without losing the odd and breezy travelogue style of Steven Spielberg's...",Newsday,Linda Winer,04/10/2011
Catch Me If You Can,2,Catch Me If You Can,"Under Jack O'Brien's impersonal direction, the talented cast works hard to make an impression. As Frank, Aaron Tveit has stage presence, sings powerfully, and dances with pizzazz, but he's unpersuasive as a teenager and misses the character's vulnerability. The role of Hanratty has been retooled to fit Norbert Leo Butz's wonderfully shlumpy eccentricity, and the actor brings all his formidable musical comedy skills to bear on it, but even the heroic Butz can't transcend the synthetic material. As Frank's downward-spiraling father, Tom Wopat sounds the evening's sole notes of genuine humanity but can't finesse a final exit of extreme bathos. In the too little, too late role of Brenda, a young nurse Frank falls for, Kerry Butler offers her trademark ditziness and is saddled with the painfully pointless ""Fly, Fly Away,"" a misguided attempt at a late-Act 2 showstopper.",Backstage,Erik Haagensen,04/10/2011
Catch Me If You Can,2,Don't Let its Name Be a Curse,"On the credit side is an unusually fine piece of acting by Norbert Leo Butz as Special Agent Carl Hanratty (played in the film by Tom Hanks). Tom Wopat, one of Broadway's finest singers, shows off his ever-reliable pipes as Frank's father, and Mr. Tveit is thoroughly likable as Frank. The most that can be said about Jack O'Brien's staging, alas, is that it's efficient, while Jerry Mitchell's choreography is as facelessly derivative as the songs. Best of all is Kerry Butler as Brenda Strong, Frank's hapless girlfriend. Ms. Butler has somehow contrived to give a performance glowing with truth in a show that's devoid of it.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,04/12/2011
Jerusalem,10,Blazing Mark Rylance Fuels High-Octane 'Jerusalem',"A three-hour epic, “Jerusalem” begins with a fairy singing the lovely poem set to music by Sir Hubert Parry, which is shattered by rock music blaring from the speakers atop Rooster’s home. From there we’re off on a harrowing but frequently hilarious ride, staged with compulsive energy by Ian Rickson in a setting by Ultz that combines nature in bloom and humanity in wreckage, lit with dappling realism by Mimi Jordan Sherin. We know it will not end well. It’s to Butterworth’s credit that we are left so conflicted by this meeting with a force of nature, in the best play of the season.",Bloomberg News,Jeremy Gerard,04/21/2011
Jerusalem,10,"This Blessed Plot, This Trailer, This England","""Jerusalem"" could have been written in almost any year from the 1920s onward. Yet this work takes you places - distant, out-of-time places - that well-made plays seldom do. And it thinks big - transcendently big - in ways contemporary drama seldom dares...But Rylance also captures - to a degree I can imagine no other contemporary actor doing - Johnny's vast, vital, Falstaffian appetite for pleasure, for independence, for life itself.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,04/21/2011
Jerusalem,9,Mark Rylance Triumphs Again on Broadway,"""Jerusalem"" clocks in at over three hours — with two intermissions — and is a marathon for Rylance, who does a headstand into a bucket of water at the beginning and then stumbles about, getting into fights, smoking drugs, drinking speed-laced beer and hysterically cocking his snoot at everyone the entire time. Director Ian Rickson might have made a few cuts to keep the running time down, particularly in the second act, which lags at times. Butterworth's script, often lyrical and always rooted, also has made no allowances for an American audience, so brush up on British slang for such drug-related terms as ""snafflers"" and ""whizz.""",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,04/22/2011
Jerusalem,9,Jerusalem,"Both the playwright and the production find resonance in the raves and rants of an ornery sot and his relationship to the succeeding generations of kids who use him and drop him. And much credit goes to Rylance, one of the most magnetic, fearlessly physical actors on stage today. Just as he wowed New York audiences in La Bete and Boeing Boeing, the actor uses his dense body as much as his words, this time contorting with the specific, hopping, pained hobble and the puffed-out chest of a proud, foolish, self-destructive fantasist who can't believe that his body (or at least his bum foot) has betrayed him. (Not for nothing does Rylance thank his trainer and his chiropractor in his Playbill credits.) His Johnny is a roaring wreck (he's got a wife who's left him, and a young son), barred from every pub in town. Yet he's got deep-down English pride in his battered bones. Rylance wears Johnny's contradictions like vivid warrior paint.",Entertainment Weekly,Lisa Schwarzbaum,04/21/2011

Jerusalem,9,Lowlife lives the high life in 'Jerusalem',"It has nothing to do with the Middle East, though it is about lost tribes.

Jerusalem,9,Jerusalem,"Considering his brilliant comic turn earlier this season in the revival of La Bete and now his titanic performance in Jez Butterworth’s new play Jerusalem at the same theater, we might as well engrave actor Mark Rylance’s Tony Award right now. We also might as well hand over the Music Box Theatre to this dazzling thespian so he can pretty much do whatever he wants with it.",ScheckOnTheater,Frank Scheck,04/22/2011
Jerusalem,9,Jerusalem,"It seems significant that the program for Jerusalem lists no understudy for Mark Rylance, because watching his astonishing performance as Johnny ""Rooster"" Byron makes it impossible to imagine anyone else ever inhabiting the role. That takes nothing away, however, from the rude beauty of Jez Butterworth's sprawling, shattering play. To borrow a phrase from Rooster, it might be described as an ""alcoholic, bucolic frolic,"" except that it's so much more.",The Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,04/21/2011
Jerusalem,9,Jerusalem,"Ian Rickson’s picturesque staging is a model of tightly paced realism, with necessary room for more stylized passages. At three hours, Jerusalem flies by, thanks to Butterworth’s terrific ear and Rylance’s tirelessly inventive turn as a man who seems half mortal, half imp, all theatrical god. And we worship him—even if his giants and fairies are not native to this land. For three hours, at least, Jerusalem’s “mountain green” and “pleasant pastures” are ours. Anybody who cares about thrilling, world-class drama must make the pilgrimage.",Time Out New York,David Cote,04/22/2011

Under Ian Rickson's smooth helming, other colorful visitors surface from the heavy human traffic at Rooster's camp, many of them from the original Royal Court production.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,04/21/2011
Jerusalem,9,Jerusalem Brings Blood and Guts to Broadway,"Rylance takes it to the max--and the mat. Rarely has an antihero been so antiheroic. His limp alone looks so real I wouldn't be surprised if he let himself get run over by a car for the proper effect...It's a real experience, and though it becomes too ponderous and hard to take, I welcome anything with a statement and the theatrical means to blare it.",Village Voice,Michael Musto,04/21/2011
Jerusalem,9,'Jerusalem' on Broadway,"Rewardingly, too, “Jerusalem” is a large canvas, and under the resourceful guidance of director Ian Rickson, the cast of 16 — a veritable horde for a straight play on Broadway — adds to the evening’s vivid spectrum. In particular, John Gallagher Jr. and Mackenzie Crook, as two of the latter-day Lost Boys who glom onto Johnny for fellowship and a reliable high in the woods, imbue their characters with authentic feels for the insecurities of young men unsure of their identities. Alan David is splendid, too, playing a local eccentric who finds in Johnny a kindred lunatic spirit.",Washington Post,Peter Marks,04/21/2011
Jerusalem,8,Jerusalem,"Rylance gives a mesmerizing, thoroughly transformative performance that will leave theatergoers in awe of his spectacular physical and vocal abilities. Tony-winner John Gallagher Jr., who joins much of the original English cast, makes an excellent addition as a local youth about to go off to Australia.

Jerusalem,7,'Jerusalem' speaks to England's changing culture,"An award-winning hit in London, “Jerusalem” is very, very, very English in its cultural references and significance. As the play wends its garrulous way towards a baleful conclusion, some American viewers may wonder why they should care about Johnny, a messy wastrel who idly corrupts adolescents. But that would be missing the higher pretensions of Butterworth’s drama and certainly not appreciating Rylance’s deeply-immersed depiction of Johnny.",New Jersey Newsroom,Michael Sommers,04/22/2011
Jerusalem,6,'Jerusalem',"But the play, which runs more than three hours, yields diminishing returns. The plot goes in circles and collapses during a contrived meeting between Johnny and Marky. Fortunately, Rylance keeps you from tuning out. He won the 2008 Tony for his hilarious clowning in ""Boeing-Boeing,"" and in ""La Bete"" earlier this season, he was sheer delight as a buffoonish actor. As Johnny, a cross between the Pied Piper and Fagan, he does everything he can, including handstands, to create a vivid and ultimately touching portrait of a magnetic maniac. Johnny's stories of giants may be nonsense, but there's no denying that Rylance wows you with performances that are larger than life.",New York Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,04/22/2011

This year there are two, ""War Horse"" and Jez Butterworth's ""Jerusalem,"" and those Anglophiles who like their accents thick and their plays pretentious will prefer the latter to the former. Indeed, ""Jerusalem"" is pretentious almost without limit, a three-hour save-our-England tract in which the uplift is slathered with a thick brown sauce composed of two parts coarse humor and one part pseudopoetry. In addition, ""Jerusalem"" features a performance by Mark Rylance (""La Bête,"" ""Boeing-Boeing"") that is every bit as good as the critical buzz that accompanied its transfer from London's West End.

What he does not have, alas, is an editor. ""Ghetto Klown,"" the fifth chapter in what has become a live-onstage autobiography, runs almost 21/2 hours, including intermission.

This is true because of the across-the-board excellence of the artists who have contributed to this production, from the playwright to the director (Moises Kaufman), from the top-notch team of designers to the brilliant ensemble of actors on stage. Here is a play that's been crafted to entertain, to engage, to challenge, and to jolt its audience—and that succeeds in all of these endeavors, shatteringly.

Good People,9,Good People,"If ""Good People"" isn't a hit for Manhattan Theater Club, there is no justice in the land. David Lindsay-Abaire pays his respects to his old South Boston neighborhood with this tough and tender play about the insurmountable class divide between those who make it out of this blue-collar Irish neighborhood and those who find themselves left behind. The scrappy characters have tremendous appeal, and the moral dilemma they grapple with -- is it strength of character or just a few lucky breaks that determines a person's fate? -- holds special significance in today's harsh economic climate.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,03/03/2011

Tate Donovan is sensational, oozing conflicted impulses as a man desperate to shed his Southie skin. His liberal wife, far more comfortable in her skin, is nicely played by Renee Elise Goldsberry with both passion and restraint.

Good People,8,The Bad Choices of David Lindsay-Abaire’s Good People,"It’s a given that we don’t talk about class in this country, so it’s hardly surprising that we don’t see a lot of plays about it. (We don’t see many plays, period, but that’s a different, if related, matter.) David Lindsay-Abaire’s Good People — the latest in his Rabbit Hole realism phase — isn’t exactly an Odetsian war cry. But simply by broaching the subject of haves and have-nots, it will make a stir: Prepare for overpraise for “bravery” and abuse for not going further, for ending on a note perilously close to magical complacency. Whatever. Good People is a fine, small, heartfelt work that shadowboxes with social darkness in a safely lit room, floating on a vast sea of unsaid things.",New York Magazine,Scott Brown,03/04/2011
Good People,7,Good People,"Tate Donovan proves a fine foil as Mike, highlighting the character's conflicting feelings of relief at escaping a dead-end life and guilt at no longer being a true Southie. As Kate, Renée Elise Goldsberry is best when scrambling to avoid the inadvertent cultural condescension this highly educated daughter of an African-American doctor keeps stumbling into with Margaret. Goldsberry then scores when Kate suddenly shows spine and maturity as she nails Margaret for putting her pride ahead of her daughter's well-being. Estelle Parsons makes Dottie into an engagingly colorful sideshow of eccentricities, Becky Ann Baker is a convincingly curdled Jean, and Patrick Carroll smartly stresses Stevie's decency, though the character is largely a plot device.",Backstage,Erik Haagensen,03/03/2011
Good People,6,McDormand’s Fired Ma Makes 'Good People' Fearful,"Director Daniel Sullivan can’t finesse the play’s contrivances. Chief among them is the familiar setup of a confrontation between a proud denizen of the old neighborhood and the successful striver who escaped while clinging to a highly selective, even romanticized, version of his rough-and- tumble childhood. But John Lee Beatty’s evocative sets and Pat Collins’s pale verismo lighting lift the show above the norm.",Bloomberg News,Jeremy Gerard,03/04/2011

Of course people like Margie and Mikey exist, but I doubt it's a coincidence that they are exactly the kinds of people who fit into the familiar sociological narrative that permeates every page of this play. In Mr. Lindsay-Abaire's America, success is purely a matter of luck, and virtue inheres solely in those who are luckless. So what if Mikey worked hard? Why should anybody deserve any credit for working hard? Hence the crude deck-stacking built into the script of ""Good People,"" in which Mikey is the callous villain who forgot where he came from and Margie the plucky Southie gal who may be the least little bit racist (though she never says anything nasty to Mikey's wife—that would be going too far!) but is otherwise a perfect heroine-victim.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,03/04/2011

Granted, the bar was set high on this one. Last season, Mosher directed a staggering production of ""A View From the Bridge,"" starring Liev Schreiber and Scarlett Johansson, revealing unimagined depths in Arthur Miller's melodrama.

Kiefer Sutherland, Chris Noth, Jason Patric, the comedian Jim Gaffigan, and the great Brian Cox have united to resuscitate Jason Miller’s brined-in-testosterone 1972 Pulitzer-winner, a vicious little Watergate-era object lesson in bonding and betrayal, bad leaders and blind followers, feet of clay and hearts of stone.

Both plays present an ostensibly supportive group of friends who, over the course of many drinks, turn on one another and segue into anguished confessions. Heck, there’s even an “I dare you to make that call” telephone scene in both plays. And each ends with characters revealing their profound discontent with their existential conditions. In “Boys,” of course, that’s being gay.

Hence the coach, a boorish, ill-educated stage-Irish blowhard who proudly displays pictures of Teddy Roosevelt, John Kennedy and Fightin' Joe McCarthy on his mantelpiece and salts his small talk with good old-fashioned ethnic slurs of the highest possible voltage, thereby alerting the audience to his lack of enlightenment.

Briggs becomes Pozzo, the fatuous landowner on whose property they trespass, and Foster becomes Lucky, his quasi-equine luggage-toting slave. The handsome sets by Stephen Brimson Lewis make a transition as well; when the curtain rises this time, Hirst’s home has lifted away to reveal, in Beckett’s woeful description of the setting, “A country road.

Waiting for Godot,8,‘Waiting for Godot’ & ‘No Man’s Land’ Theater Review: Ian McKellen & Patrick Stewart Lighten Up on the Angst,"Being a showoff works well for “Godot,” especially as envisioned by director Sean Mathias, who has set the play in the ruins of an old theater, where a big tree has sprung up through the boards and could provide the perfect exit if only these two old hams from vaudeville or the music hall or two-reelers could find enough strong rope to hang themselves. McKellen and Stewart are a very carefully orchestration study in contrasts here. As Estragon, Stewart is staccato and all sharp edges, his dome almost polished to a point on top. McKellen, on the other hand, seems to be sprouting hair everywhere to the point of looking furry, if not fuzzy.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,11/24/2013
Waiting for Godot,8,No Man's Land/Waiting for Godot: Theater Review,"The main roles in Godot – another pared-down play famous for the fact that nothing happens – in many ways are imperfect mirror images of Hirst and Spooner, wearing bowler hats that make them appear like a vagabond Laurel and Hardy. Stewart’s Vladimir, affectionately known as Didi, is the restless thinker, blindly clinging to the belief that the enigmatic title figure will show up for a designated appointment beneath a dead tree. McKellen’s wheezing Estragon, or Gogo, is more enfeebled, both physically and mentally. His memory is as broken as his feet, requiring Didi every day to remind him of the previous day’s events. As irascible and indulgent with each other as any old married couple, they often wonder if they wouldn’t have been better off alone.
