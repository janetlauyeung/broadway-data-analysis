[Potential Extra Credits]
1. We also conducted a topic modeling analysis, in addition to the sentiment analysis.
2. We created one more plotly visualization 
3. We finished the in-class exercise on the ethical considerations of the project (Submitted in class on December 4th). 


This repository contains two directories that include all the scripts, links, and files pertaining to the broadway data analysis Project Part 3 for ANLY 501: 
1. Additional-Analysis 
2. Visualizations




Directory 1: Additional-Analysis 
This directory contains two folders for the two types of analysis we conduncted as well as a PDF file that includes the writeup of the analysis.

PDF File: Project_Part3_Writeup


Folder 1: Sentiment-Analysis 

[Script] 
- part3-sentimentAnalysis.py 

[Input Data Files]
The following csv files are the input files for the script part3-sentimentAnalysis.py: 
1. unlabeled.csv
2. manually_annotated.csv

The python script read the following file, but the code is now commented out. We have provided explanations in the script. We think it would be safe to put this input file in this folder just in case you'd like to run the function. 
1. clean_review.csv 	


Folder 2: Topic-Modeling

[Script] 
- part3-topicModeling.py 
- In order for this script to run successfully, in addition to install the packages imported at the top of the script (e.g. gensim, spacy), one should also install the model used in this script. Please run the following command in the terminal: python3 -m spacy download en

[Input Data Files]
- clean_review.csv

[Figures]
The following two figures are generated by the script:
1. topic distribution.png
2. topic modeling.png




Directory 2: Visualizations

[Input Data Files] 
The following csv files are the input files for the script part3-viz-plotly.py that generates our plotly visualizations:

1. part2cleanedSocialMedia.csv 					(Visualization 1, 4)
2. grosses_cleaned.csv 							(Visualization 2)
3. Musical_ratings-withoutNa-cleaned.csv 		(Visualization 3, 4)
4. part2cleanedGrosses.csv 						(Visualization 5)


[Scripts]
- part3-viz-plotly.py 	contains the code for our 5 plot.ly visualizations: 

[Word Document]
- Visualizations.docx 	contains copies of all of the graphics 
- (notes: plotly visualizations cannot be interactive in this Word document. Please refer to the website or the links below to see the interactive versions)


[URLs/Local Files for Visualizations]
The following URLS/files direct to to all the visualizations (9) we have created for this part of the project. The order of the visualizations is the same as they are ordered in the script (for plotly) as well as the Word document. The following info is also provided for each visulization:
- Titles of all the visualizations
- Locations of all the visulizations on the website
- File names of the local .png files
