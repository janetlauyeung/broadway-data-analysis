2,The Bridges of Madison County,7,Aisle View: Bridge Over Troubled Adaptation,"Here we have a musical which in its finest moments offers the sort of robustly romantic Broadway-style singing--and writing--that brings to mind such treasures as Carousel and The Most Happy Fella. Those shows, when mounted properly, offer emotional peaks and climaxes so effective that there's not a dry eye in the house. In Bridges of Madison County, when romance goes asunder and the sympathetic lovers are forced apart, we sit there stonefaced, with nary a wet eye in the house. At least, not where I was sitting. You enjoy the wonderful performances and the numerous soaring ballads, frustrated that this exceptional work isn't contained in a more workable musical.",Huffington Post,Steven Suskin,2/20/14
2,To Kill A Mockingbird,8,Theater Review: Aaron Sorkin’s To Kill a Mockingbird Adaptation Walks the Walk,"Bartlett Sher and his designers have created a shifting, breathing, gorgeously orchestrated world, and while the top-billed Jeff Daniels is indeed lighting up the stage as the story's iconic lawyer, every member of the ensemble shines alongside him. As a company, under Sher's careful and majestic direction, they are incandescent.",Vulture,Sara Holdren,12/13/18
0,The People in the Picture,1,The Invisible Girls,"Much talent has been squandered on this stale confection, starting with that of Ms. Murphy, who switches from youth to old age and back again so deftly that you'll smile each time she does it. The cast is full of pros (it's always a joy to see Lewis J. Stadlen at work), and Andy Blankenbuehler, lately of ""In the Heights,"" has staged the musical numbers with pleasing skill. If you have an unusually high tolerance for sentiment, you might find ""The People in the Picture"" barely endurable.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,4/29/11
1,King Charles III,9,'King Charles III' an entertaining new thriller,"When was the last time you saw a new play that was written in iambic pentameter, or a futuristic fantasy about real-life, still-living political figures? Mike Bartlett's ""King Charles III,"" a critical and commercial hit in London, audaciously applies the conventions of the Shakespearean history play to today's British royal family, who are portrayed immediately after the death of the currently reigning 89-year-old Elizabeth II.",amNY,Matt Windman,11/1/15
2,Jerusalem,9,Jerusalem Brings Blood and Guts to Broadway,"Rylance takes it to the max--and the mat. Rarely has an antihero been so antiheroic. His limp alone looks so real I wouldn't be surprised if he let himself get run over by a car for the proper effect...It's a real experience, and though it becomes too ponderous and hard to take, I welcome anything with a statement and the theatrical means to blare it.",Village Voice,Michael Musto,4/21/11
0,The Visit,6,‘The Visit’ review: Chita Rivera stars in shoulda-been-better Kander and Ebb musical of revenge,"Revenge is a dish served tepid in ""The Visit."" The warmth hobbles this stark musical fable by John Kander, Fred Ebb and Terrence McNally. With this team, the show is certainly worthwhile. But it could really send shivers -- and doesn't. ""The Visit"" pulls its punches...The score echoes earlier rhythms and melodies of Kander and Ebb and provides an evocative backdrop. Rivera's husky voice and high-watt charisma go a long way here. And it would have worked even better if director John Doyle's staging was less polite. Scott Pask's skeletal set and Ann Hould-Ward's raggedy clothes scream decay. But the performances don't go there...Wildcat? No. Claire and ""The Visit"" are too domesticated for their own good.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,4/23/15
2,To Kill A Mockingbird,8,"Review: A Broadway ‘Mockingbird,’ Elegiac and Effective","These are two worthy ideas, if contradictory. In light of racial injustice, accommodation seems to be a white luxury; in light of accommodation, justice seems hopelessly naïve.

2,A View from the Bridge,9,'View From the Bridge' on Broadway: Seeing every side of the story,"The white-hot director Ivo van Hove is not the first to embrace the passionate smolder behind Arthur Miller's 1955 play of forbidden passion in Italian-American Brooklyn...But it is hard to recall another staged production -- beyond this exquisitely profound Broadway import from London's Young Vic Theatre Company starring Mark Strong, Nicola Walker and Phoebe Fox -- that has depicted with such complexity and intensity what Eddie and his niece actually had together, before his infuriatingly effeminate usurper Rodolpho arrives, illegally, from the motherland...this is the very rare production that matches the complexity of the text, with its mixed-messaged collision of the cerebral and the sensual, a dichotomy at the heart of everything Miller ever wrote...Van Hove's brilliance is multifaceted, but much rests on his ability to focus the mind and soul on a work's tiny moments.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,11/12/15
2,Of Mice and Men,8,"First Nighter: Franco, O'Dowd, Meester Distinguish Steinbeck's 'Of Mice and Men'","The beauty of Steinbeck's themes is that they're embedded in any number of pungent scenes that the cast members--many of them, like Franco, and Meester, making the Broadway bows--bring to vivid, heart-wrenching life under Shapiro's taut direction...Although Franco overdoes the level of his disappointment with Lennie at the opening, he pulls back through the remaining two acts to give a shaded view of a strong, moral man who has an obligation he can't refuse to honor and yet knows could be his undoing. O'Dowd brings all manner of subtlety to Lennie. What he does with his fluttery hands alone is acting inspiration. He sees that Lennie's feelings are all unguardedly on the surface and expresses that through mood changes often simultaneously funny and sorrowful.",Huffington Post,David Finkle,4/16/14
2,School of Rock ,9,‘School of Rock’ review: Andrew Lloyd Webber’s enjoyable return to Broadway,"The first thing to know is that the kids, cast through a high-profile talent search, are genuine children who play their own instruments, and they're all terrific. The other essential fact is that the substitute teacher, a character indelibly stamped on the film by Jack Black, has been shrewdly honored here by Alex Brightman, a helium balloon of a force that can bounce off walls and manage tender emotions with equal conviction.",Newsday,Linda Winer,12/6/15
2,An Evening with Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin,8,NY Review: 'An Evening With Patti Lupone and Mandy Patinkin',"Like peanut butter and jelly, Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin are two great tastes that taste great together. Each is a one-of-a-kind talent: Patinkin with his extraordinary range and eccentric delivery that can switch from a delicate falsetto to an earth-rumbling bass without missing a beat, and LuPone with her powerful pipes, steamroller personality, and unique voice capable of approximating an entire brass section from trumpet to alto sax. When these two nonpareils combine, as they do in their concert at Broadway's Ethel Barrymore Theatre, simply titled ""An Evening With Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin,"" you get not only a delicious theatrical sandwich, but also dramatic magic.",Backstage,David Sheward,11/21/11
2,Fiddler on the Roof,9,A ‘Fiddler On The Roof’ Broadway Revival That Reaches For Topicality – Review,"But the company struck me as hellbent on selling a Broadway show that needs no salesmanship. Burstein is the key examplar of this. A treasure, he was terrific in Sher's ravishing productions of South Pacific and Golden Boy for Lincoln Center Theatre... But his Tevye is too nebbishy, too ingratiating to charm us into becoming his allies as he struggled to deal with the cruel forces of change from the outside world and within his own family. He's too nice.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,12/20/15
1,The Gin Game,7,"First Nighter: James Earl Jones, Cicely Tyson Play 'The Gin Game'; Oren Safdie's Unseemly 'Unseamly'","If you think you're about to hear anything critical of the two old pros James Earl Jones and Cicely Tyson in director Leonard Foglia's revival of D. L. Coburn's 1977 comedy, The Gin Game, at the Golden Theatre, you better think again. As two lonely residents at a home for the aged who find comfort playing cards with each other in a rundown backyard, they're well nigh perfect -- which is what you already knew they would be.",Huffington Post,David Finkle,10/14/15
2,The Lifespan of a Fact,8,"REVIEW: In 'The Lifespan of a Fact' on Broadway, Daniel Radcliffe rails against truthiness","There are contrivances - the play does not acknowledge that most fabulists, like most abusers, are serial offenders. And its binary conflict does not allow for the truth that even the most fiction-loving writer probably would prefer to avoid being sued for libel. But then it's a self-aware comedy: at one point, Radcliffe's truly relentless Jim climbs all the way inside a closet under his quarry's stairs, delighting the Harry Potter fans in the house. That is not the only meta moment. The writers based their play on a real essay penned by the writer John D'Agata and the editor Jim Fingal, which was in turn based on their actual encounter in getting an article ready for publication. So it's a blend of fact and fiction. Right?",New York Daily News,Chris Jones,10/18/18
2,It's Only a Play,9,‘It's Only a Play’ Theater Review: Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick Remain Broadway's Funniest Team,"If only it were a better play...A lot has changed on Broadway in 30 years, but for McNally it all comes down to changing not much more than a few tons of famous names. McNally doesn't just drop names -- he stomps on them, too...These put-downs comprise act one. In act two, the characters take turn reading the bad reviews. Brantley takes more jabs, but frankly, his New York Times reviews are much funnier than McNally's imitations. Many of the jokes would fail if not for Lane, Broderick and their savvy director, Jack O'Brien...Somehow the vet actors deliver and the new talent keeps coming, and it's nice to report that this revival offers not one, but two, spectacular Broadway debuts.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,10/9/14
1,Let It Be,7,STAGE REVIEW Let It Be,"a new musical revue in which, to describe it as drily as it was conceived, four men perform 40 Beatles classics, chronologically - has an authenticity problem. It's not that the production...isn't authentic enough (although that's the simplest argument one could make). It's that it doesn't know whether it wants to be authentic or not...Let It Be does have some fun with the cultural monolith of the Beatles: Once we escape dour Liverpool, get past black-and-white Ed Sullivan, cruise through A Hard Day's Night and Shea Stadium, we land on the more wondrous shores of Sgt. Pepper, with the perfectly ridiculous costumes and plenty of psychedelic lightning and projections. Here the musical gorging becomes a visual feast, and the band-as-simulacrum suddenly feels appropriate. Still, they have got to get some better mustaches. B-",Entertainment Weekly,Nick Catucci,7/24/13
2,On the Twentieth Century,10,'Century' a grand vehicle for Chenoweth,"Chenoweth brings to Lily, along with those requisites, the girlish goofiness, feline sexuality and gleaming, chirping soprano - higher and brighter than Kaye's - that have made her one of her generation's most distinctive musical theater talents. At 46, Chenoweth lends both an ingenue's exuberance and a knowing wit to production numbers that require her to juggle virtual arias with hyperkinetic dance routines. Yet while Lily may well be the role of Chenoweth's career, this Century, which opened Sunday at the American Airlines Theatre, is by no means her triumph alone. In this production, directed with giddy virtuosity by Scott Ellis, every player seems perfectly cast - starting with the leading man, Peter Gallagher...",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,3/15/15
0,Side Show,6,Theater Review: The Dual Nature of Side Show,"Despite what seemed like weeks of buzz about its radical transformations, the revival of Side Show that opened on Broadway tonight is not as meaningfully different from the 1997 original as its current creatives would like to think. Now as then, the cult musical about the conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton is itself conjoined. (There's no avoiding the Siamese imagery; many of the songs, and even the title, play on the theme.) The story of the Hiltons' rise from circus freaks to vaudeville stars in the early 1930s, with all the requisite references to cultural voyeurism and its human costs, is fused to an intimate story of emotional accommodation between sisters as unalike as sisters can be. The problem with Side Show is that these stories can't be separated, and only one can thrive.",Vulture,Jesse Green,11/17/14
1,True West,8,True West,"If the charismatic Hawke all but wipes the floor with Dano in the play's first half, Dano gets his turn to act out in Act Two. These are showcase roles, and the actors play them with gusto. James Macdonald's Roundabout Theatre Company production occasionally errs on the side of the obvious: Marylouise Burke brings her customary off-kilter comic panache to her cameo as the brothers' late-returning mom, but Gary Wilmes smears an extra layer of grease on the already oleaginous role of a Hollywood producer, and a showy change of lighting undermines Austin's big story about how his dissolute father lost two pairs of teeth.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,1/24/19
2,The Price,9,"‘The Price’ review: Danny DeVito, Mark Ruffalo make Arthur Miller revival shine","After radical, dazzling director-driven revivals of Miller's ""A View From the Bridge"" and ""The Crucible,"" not to mention the profoundly stripped-down rethinking of Tennessee Williams' ""The Glass Menagerie,"" it feels almost novel - at least, quietly reassuring - to have a lesser-known Miller work presented with down-the-middle sensibilities and expert care.",Newsday,Linda Winer,3/16/17
1,Private Lives,7,Cattrall sexes up dull ‘Lives’,"Gross seems to lose his footing, and his Elyot fails to convey any passion for Amanda. This is a big problem since, plot-wise, there's only a series of quicksilver switches from desire to annoyance and back again.

1,Rock of Ages,6,HIT PARADE'S NOT ROCK-SOLID,"""Rock of Ages"" is what it is: a jukebox musical stringing together songs so familiar, the program lists them in small print between the hosiery credits and the union logos. If you can't identify the first seconds of ""Sister Christian,"" you shouldn't be at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre to begin with. It's not as if the material's been Broadway-ified, either. Backed by an onstage band, the cast rocks out over arrangements that remain pretty close to the originals. And guess what? Familiarity does breed content. Especially if you're the kind of person who gets misty hearing ""Every Rose Has Its Thorn.""",New York Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,4/8/09
2,The Road to Mecca,8,Those Who Seek to Make Art Often Find Themselves Alone,"In this quiet, slow and ultimately powerful production, directed by Gordon Edelstein and featuring strong performances from Jim Dale and Carla Gugino, Ms. Harris plays Miss Helen, an elderly South African woman who has hitherto seemed gracious, fretful and rather prosaic. Now she has given undiluted voice to the kind of fear that lurks in everyone — one of those personal fears that are so profound that people shirk from naming them. She is magnificent and shrunken, harrowed and harrowing.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,1/17/12
2,Death of a Salesman,9,Death of a Salesman: Theater Review,"Impeccably cast down to the smallest roles, with an ensemble led by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Linda Emond and Andrew Garfield, this emotionally wrenching production evokes the unmistakable atmosphere and attitudes of mid-century America while also putting down trenchant roots in today’s world. ... I had never before experienced the overwhelming impact of the drama to this degree, nor appreciated the extent to which Miller’s observations are culturally specific while at the same time universal and prophetic.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,3/15/12
1,That Championship Season,6,"Male bonding in 'Season,' with great cast","Despite its creation in a tumultuous era, this never was a more than a solid piece of middlebrow message-naturalism. And despite the care and affection lavished on the handsome production, it remains a male-bonding parlor drama that signals its big secrets more clearly than it justifies a high-profile revival. Granted, the bar was set high on this one. Last season, Mosher directed a staggering production of ""A View From the Bridge,"" starring Liev Schreiber and Scarlett Johansson, revealing unimagined depths in Arthur Miller's melodrama. When Mosher chose Kiefer Sutherland, Jim Gaffigan, Chris Noth, Jason Patric and Brian Cox for this conventional piece of curdled mid-America, one could be forgiven for thinking the director had something special in mind for it.",Newsday,Linda Winer,3/6/11
0,Kinky Boots,4,The Who-Cares Test,"Ms. Lauper, who is better known as a singer than a songwriter, has written the score of ""Kinky Boots"" all by herself, and it sounds like it came off a boxed set called ""Cyndi: The Deservedly Forgotten Late-'80s B-Sides."" Jerry Mitchell, the director and choreographer, has done his best to make something out of nothing, but he is incapable of coaxing an interesting performance out of Mr. Sands, who is a good singer and a dull actor. Mr. Porter, more or less conversely, is a good actor and a just-about-adequate singer. Who cares? You won't.",Wallstreet Journal,Terry Teachout,4/4/13
2,Amazing Grace,7,Theater review: Spirited musical 'Amazing Grace' on Broadway leaves you hissing at the hero,"A serious musical with epic themes doesn't come to Broadway that often. The refreshing new show ""Amazing Grace"" admirably covers slavery, abolition, sedition and spiritual themes in 1740s England and Africa, complete with spirited acting and inspirational ballads and anthems...A charismatic Josh Young opens the show strongly...Erin Mackey sings captivatingly, wearing a sweet, saintly air as Mary Catlett...It's a long time coming, but the title song is performed in the beautiful and emotional finale. By then we've been on quite a journey with these characters, and the hymn resonates with relevance and hope, both for their personal stories and the still-uneasy state of racial relations today.""",Associated Press,Jennifer Farrar,7/16/15
2,Constellations,9,"Nerds in Love, Rewriting Destinies","Who knew that higher physics could be so sexy, so accessible -- and so emotionally devastating? ""Constellations,"" Nick Payne's gorgeous two-character drama, starring a perfectly matched Jake Gyllenhaal and Ruth Wilson, may be the most sophisticated date play Broadway has seen...as staged by its original director, Michael Longhurst, ""Constellations"" has been scaled up without bloat, and it's every bit as affecting as I remember...It's no surprise that Ms. Wilson...is comfortable with her role's demands. But Mr. Gyllenhaal, whose theater experience is more limited, is every bit as persuasive. They are both fluent in the awkward body language of nerds in love, and in the crossed signals of emotional ambivalence. But they use contrasting and complementary physical vocabularies to balance, gracefully and clumsily, shifts in power and longing, aggression and retreat.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,1/13/15
2,The Ferryman,9,Theater Review: Livestock and Stock Types in The Ferryman,"The devil of it all is that is that, both despite and because of its flagrant use of formula, The Ferryman hooks us through the gills and pulls us along. After all, are we not entertained? There's a live goose, for God's sake. In the wake of the play's frantic, lurid, pull-out-all-the-stops-and-knock-down-all-the-pins conclusion (which makes the whole play feel like the prequel to an as-yet-unwritten bloodbath blockbuster called The Wrath of Quinn), the audience rocketed to its feet - and I got the reaction. Even though, when I stopped to think about it, at least three different elements of the story's final catastrophic 60 seconds left me wondering, ""Wait, but why?"" In a sense, set and costume designer Rob Howell's rendering of the Carneys' farmhouse, with its barrage of meticulous detail and its absurdly outsize proportions, is the perfect metaphor for the play itself: It's a head-trippy presentation of rich, authentic-seeming texture inside a romanticized, larger-than-life box - a gourmet meal by a very clever chef that somehow gives us the same uneasy satisfaction as Lucky Charms. ""That just... almost looked right,"" said the friend who saw it with me, whose family lives in Donegal, ""And... almost felt right. But...""",Vulture,Sara Holdren,10/21/18
1,Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,5,'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' review: Sedate revival for Scarlett Johansson,"Broadway has embraced many - perhaps too many - breeds of ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" in recent years. Tennessee Williams' hungry and restless Maggie has been reincarnated as a slinky sexpot (Elizabeth Ashley), a sexual bulldozer (Kathleen Turner), an ineffectual flower (Ashley Judd) and, barely five years ago, a smartly luscious kitten (Anika Noni Rose) in the all-black production best remembered for James Earl Jones as Big Daddy. What we have not had, at least in my experience, is a sedate Maggie in a tasteful, even timid revival of Williams' 1955 Pulitzer winner about voracious Southern-gothic greed and a loveless, lying family.",Newsday,Linda Winer,1/17/13
0,Bandstand,7,‘Bandstand’ review: Band of war vets serves up music and emotion,"The title ""Bandstand"" is a curveball. So is the subtitle, ""The New American Musical."" For audiences of a certain age, the name of the season's final musical suggests those dopey and adored teen dance shows that began on '50s TV. To audiences of a different certain age, the '40s look of the publicity photos implies a happy story of the bands that entertained the troops in World War II and moviegoers forevermore. Once inside the theater, however, we discover that we are meant to take the word apart and take it seriously. This is a musical - really, more of a musical drama - about a band of damaged war veterans who take a stand while competing in a national radio contest in 1945. The concept is more ambitious, darker and more sophisticated than its name invites theatergoers to enjoy. It is also more than a little shapeless and overly long.",Newsday,Linda Winer,4/26/17

The show's design is another asset, including the set whose walls look like graph paper... When Chris imagines himself tumbling in space, held aloft and spun by his fellow actors, it's lump-in-the-throat time. Not everything works as weightlessly. The play-within-the-play device can confuse, as when Christopher gives fellow actors notes about their performances.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,10/5/14

2,Forever Tango,8,Forever Tango: Theater Review,"...this Broadway summer filler's main challenge is to inject variation into an entertainment built entirely around a single sultry dance tradition, defined by its heightened sense of melodramatic sizzle. But creator-director Luis Bravo's worldwide hit addresses the fatigue issue by steadily cranking up the degree of difficulty in the routines as the marathon progresses....Smirnoff and Chmerkovskiy are about as authentically Argentinean as Tango & Cash, but who cares? The crowd is mad for them, and it's easy to see why. They're tall, sinuous and sexy, delivering polished showmanship with effortless charisma. The four routines that feature the duo are among the highlights",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,7/14/13
1,Mean Girls,6,"Review: Bye bye, Lindsay Lohan. In Tina Fey's 'Mean Girls' on Broadway, the arty geeks take center stage.","All of Fey's long-form shows have unfolded at rapid paces and ""Mean Girls"" is no exception. It's packed with body-twisting and often witty choreography from Nicholaw, whose show, with a set by Scott Pask, is so stocked with stimulation (verbal, physical, digital) that it rests not for a second, a choice that does not help Henningsen really change, given that Richmond's score, as energetic and funny as everything else here, is hardly centered on self-reflective ballads. But that likely will delight much of the audience who'll be trying to figure out why that dance number had boys in drag (don't ask me) and that one had that Easter egg and so on. At the Saturday matinee I saw, the balcony was having so much whoop-it-up fun, I was worried about someone's tucked-away phone falling and smacking me on my balding pate.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,4/8/18
2,The Normal Heart,8,A Still-Blistering 'Normal Heart' Hits Broadway,"Larry Kramer's historic play about the beginning of an epidemic that has killed millions can be seen as a time capsule of a period when the disease was first emerging. But it can also be a cautionary tale for any horror we have yet to fully grasp...Mantello manages to make his unlovable Weeks lovable and he steers clear of hagiography. Joel Grey and George C.

At a time when some of its key surrealism is commonplace, Blue Leaves' other antic bits of wackiness—a fatal bombing played for laughs; hearing aids confused for pills—are still funny but land less effectively.

1,Dead Accounts,4,Theater review: ‘Dead Accounts’,"In lieu of an engaging story, unseen people, including the sibs’ sick dad, are gabbed about while undeveloped thematic strands dangle. Ideas rise up about staying put in one’s hometown vs. leaving, buying into God vs. worshipping money and life in New York vs. the Midwest. After an hour, Jack’s wife, Jenny (Judy Greer, miscast as a model of urbanity), arrives and reveals that her soon-to-be ex has raided neglected bank accounts of dead people to the tune of $27 million. The huge sum is a device to reveal Jenny’s greed and to give Lorna an aria about why she can’t fret about banks getting screwed.
Director Jack O’Brien can’t do much with the material, so he puts his energy into moody scene changes. And he cast Butz, who he guided to Best Actor Tony wins in “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” and “Catch Me If You Can.”",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,11/29/12
1,On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,4,Forecast cloudy for retooled 'Clear Day',"The reincarnation of the 1965 musical ""On a Clear Day You Can See Forever"" now begins with its leading man, a shrink named Dr. Mark Bruckner, addressing a 1974 meeting of the American Psychological Association and discussing a patient who apparently was someone else in a past life, a someone with whom this doctor fell in love. When the star of the new Broadway version, Harry Connick Jr., starts to lecture, you're immediately put in mind of Al Gore. The craggy crooner, who plays opposite the gorgeously voiced Chicago star Jessie Mueller in a troubled and perplexing show that is hardly the best vehicle for her Broadway debut, has a physical resemblance to the handsome former vice president, and he also embodies some of Gore's signature stiffness. But among many inconvenient truths in this revival, with a radically retooled new book by Peter Parnell and direction and reconception by Michael Mayer, Connick — the big star on the marquee — is just not given a character or persona within which he can rest easy.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,12/11/11

2,Big Fish,7,Review - BIG FISH Makes Wholesome The New Hip,"Wholesomeness gets a bad rap on Broadway these days, usually regarded as the kind of unbearably sweet and inoffensive entertainment that sophisticated theatergoers must endure while taking their conservative grandmas out for a night on the town...But Big Fish, the new musical that tattoos its heart on its arm, displays no fear in plopping its unabashed wholesomeness right in your lap. Its spirit is steeped in Rodgers and Hammerstein decency that propels an evening that's adventurous, romantic and, yeah, kinda hip. That said, the work of Andrew Lippa (score) and John August (book, based on his own screenplay of Daniel Wallace's novel) is not exactly top shelf musical theatre (although on paper Big Fish easily outclasses any original-run Broadway musical currently on the boards) but director/choreographer Susan Stroman, at the top of her game, whips this warmhearted story into a supremely imaginative and heart-tugging entertainment.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,10/6/13
2,The Testament of Mary,9,The Testament of Mary: Theater Review,"A dense, boldly unorthodox piece for risk-averse Broadway, it has been directed with transfixing focus by Deborah Warner, whose frequent collaborations with Shaw go back 25 years...[Shaw's] Mary is haunted, scornful, a hardened skeptic as uncompromisingly judgmental with herself as she is with others. She also has the manic energy of a woman whose refusal of the comforts of sleep - and more pointedly, the healing balm of dreams - has taken her beyond fatigue...Provocative as much of the content is, Toibin is not doing anything so blunt as a revisionist interpretation of the Scriptures. He is undertaking a nuanced psychological exploration of a figure whose nobility is due in part to her eternal silence, rendering her instead here as a woman who will not be silenced.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,4/22/13

To Akhtar's credit, and that of director Kimberly Senior and her excellent cast, that tale is at least fun to watch. Hari Dhillon makes Amir...charming and frustrating, showing us both his cultivated slickness and his ongoing struggle to reconcile what he's experienced...with what he's become. Gretchen Mol movingly conveys Emily's own conflicts, and her fundamental decency.Josh Radnor and Karen Pittman provide witty, full-blooded performances as the Kapoors' guests, who seem to have their own issues...Their combined efforts make Disgraced consistently entertaining and thought-provoking -- just not as much as you wish it were.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,10/23/14

But British playwright Nick Payne's beguiling Constellations is not only a full-bodied narrative, it's a richly affecting experience. That's thanks to the sensitivity of the writing, but also to the warmth, humor and vitality invested in it by Jake Gyllenhaal and Ruth Wilson, giving two astonishing performances in a production from Michael Longhurst that's as rigorous as it is tender.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,1/13/15

It's about time that William Finn and James Lapine's intimate, obstinate, heart-shattering 1992 musical has returned to Broadway, to poke us and amuse us and reduce us again to helpless tears. Few musicals have the range, idiosyncrasy and emotional punch of this profoundly unconventional and personal work. Directed by Lapine, the show's revival is very much about a specific Jewish family in the early 1980s, and while its story of a man who leaves his wife and child for a male lover may be less novel today, its larger truths continue to resonate. Seeing Falsettos now is like opening a time capsule and finding a mirror.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,10/27/16

2,Falsettos,9,'Falsettos': Theater Review,"In fact, pretty much everything about Lincoln Center Theater's ideally cast Broadway revival, again directed by Lapine with as much humor as sensitivity, makes it pure pleasure.

Block) and son Jason (Anthony Rosenthal) to move in with his gay lover, Whizzer (Andrew Rannells); it then jumps forward to 1981, the dawn of the AIDS crisis, chronicling how this nontraditional family unit has expanded and then how it gets clobbered by the devastating reality of the time.

2,On the Town,8,'On the Town': Theater Review,"John Rando, embraces both the strengths and weaknesses of the musical...Trying to modernize On the Town would make it seem hopelessly quaint. Rando (a 2002 Tony winner for Urinetown) instead is unapologetic in presenting the old-fashioned material at face value, playing even the silliest routines with a mostly light touch, and injecting the whole dizzy narrative with an air of yearning romance. He enlists the aid of choreographer Joshua Bergasse (NBC's Smash) to channel the expressive athleticism of Robbins' dances. The chief element retained from the director's earlier brush with the show is his winning lead Tony Yazbeck, a dependable Broadway yeoman who arguably has never been more ideally cast than as Gabey. Whether in dramatic scenes, songs or in his rapturous dance numbers, Yazbeck brings just the right balance of masculinity and vulnerability, unworldliness and floating-on-air grace to the openhearted farm boy dreaming of love.

This has partly to do with Stoppard's middle-of-the-roadness, and partly with McGregor's refusal to engage with Henry's darker side. Even Gyllenhaal's feline sexiness seems overly laid-back. Nixon, on the other hand, is a standout as the cool, collected Charlotte...The star...has a haughty, coiled energy, and things flag when she's offstage for most of Act 2.

She is lovely, she is game, and you always sense her niceness. But these qualities domesticate Raquel's monstrousness; she isn't fierce enough to make her middling antics funny...What's oddest is that, without music, Fleming can't seem to find a natural shape for her lines...This distinction becomes clear when, after teasing us with snippets of arias throughout the play, Fleming finally lets loose with a whole song: ""Always.""

Working in close collaboration with Jan Versweyveld, the scenic and lighting designer, and Tal Yarden, the video designer, Mr. Van Hove has given us a TV-screens-and-Plexiglas production that looks thoroughly postmodern. The catch is that Mr. Hall's script, set in 1975, is a faithful adaptation of Chayefsky's screenplay, a once-prescient satire of the dumbed-down future of broadcast news.

He plays doomed farmer John Proctor and holds nothing back, going from slightly arrogant to flustered to full-out broken over the course of the play, a master stroke by a 35-year-old making his Broadway debut.

0,Rocky,7,Rocky: Theatre Review,"""Nobody leaves the theater humming the scenery."" That old Broadway wisecrack, often attributed to Richard Rodgers, implies that no amount of eye-popping visuals in a show can overcome an unmemorable score. Rocky may be the exception. While the songs in this musicalization of the career-making 1976 Sylvester Stallone movie come and go without leaving much of an impression, the stage magic that director Alex Timbers and set designer Christopher Barrecawork with the finale fight is so visceral and exhilarating that it sends the audience out on a high. Of course, having an indestructible story with underdog characters worth rooting for doesn't hurt either...The ace up the show's sleeve, however, is...talented lead Andy Karl, who sticks close enough to the Stallone model in his characterization as Rocky Balboa while at the same time injecting fresh vitality and humor into the role...The delicate chemistry between Karl and Seibert breathes warmth into their outsider romance, and Adrian's solos, the melancholy ""Raining"" and ""I'm Done,"" in which she finally asserts herself and stands up to overbearing Paulie, are among the better numbers.

The Roundabout gets so much right in a splendid, joy-stuffed production: casting, design and even the reduced orchestra (guided with tremendous grace by Paul Gemignani)...Benanti, besides looking as lovely as ever and earning her laughs, shows off an old-fashioned soprano with affecting vibrato.

How she turns into the wicked witch is a long, winding road filled with bizarre characters and strange plot twists. The problem with the show's book, by Winnie Holzman, is that it has to cover so much ground in a connect-the-dots fashion that we're deprived of the necessary depth and character development to make us really care about Elphaba or her unlikely friend Galinda, who later becomes Glinda the good witch. Director Joe Mantello handles the intimate scenes well, but he's not quite as successful moving the traffic on Eugene Lee's dark, mechanical set. The ensemble numbers are indistinguishable. The special effects were impressive but a show of this caliber needed more.

Though he has a stronger singing voice than Broderick and a limber, go-for-it approach to director Rob Ashford's exhaustingly acrobatic choreography, he's not a natural, effortless triple threat.

It's a feeling you too may share during Pam MacKinnon's bloodless production. She did a much better job with ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" two years ago...As the play turns to the absurd, Albee's writing brims with black humor and red-hot loathing. The show, by contrast, is a benign beige. Lithgow is best when Tobias is playing along with the women in his life, but his big letting-it-all-out scene feels forced. And Close's one-note, tight-lipped performance keeps the audience at arms' length, the way Agnes distances herself from family and friends. A delicate balance? By the end of Act 3, it might refer to the one between wakefulness and sleep.",New York Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,11/20/14
0,Disgraced,6,Gretchen Mol Tackles Brutal ‘Disgraced',"Timely dramas on Broadway are in very short supply, and that alone makes the bow of Disgraced an event worth applauding...The play has lost its essential velocity in the move from Lincoln Center Theater, where Amir was played with a thousand volts of electricity by Aasif Mandvi...On the stage of the tiny Claire Tow Theater, Mandvi seemed ready to explode at any second. Dhillon is clearly a skilled actor, but his Amir doesn't fibrillate with the pent-up anger the character needs if he is to be credible. This may have something to do, as well, with the ciphered performance by Mol, who seems to be sleepwalking through the show. She's out of her league on the Broadway stage, and you can sense from the other actors that she's giving them nothing to work with. The dazzler in this production, staged again by Kimberly Senior, is Pittman, taut and almost serenely tough...It still raises deeply discomfiting questions. But this little off-Broadway potboiler has reduced to a simmer in the move to Times Square.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,10/23/14

2,Skylight,8,Review: 'Skylight' on Broadway is funny and poignant,"Mulligan, in a crackling revival of David Hare's ""Skylight"" that opened Thursday at the Golden Theater, starts and completes a spaghetti Bolognese during the first act, chopping onions and garlic and boiling water along the way. The whiff of sausage lingers deliciously during intermission. It's a fitting theatrical device because this show, quite simply, cooks. Mulligan, a spectacular Bill Nighy, the marvelous newcomer Matthew Beard and the director Stephen Daldry make alchemy onstage with their own red-hot talent. Funny, poignant and insightful, the West End transfer ""Skylight"" is a full meal in a place where appetizers often pass as entrees.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,4/2/15

And thankfully, Director Des McAnuff put the songs front and center, bringing out the best in his outrageously talented company. But when it comes to biographical shows, it's nearly impossible to break from the clichéd formulas-the rise from rags to riches, the ravages of fame, the usual demons: drugs, booze, family sacrifice; and all of it magnified by the ever-present specter of racism.",NY1,Roma Torre,3/21/19

2,The Mystery of Edwin Drood,9,"Broadway review: It's no mystery, 'Drood' cast has an infectious good time","Director Scott Ellis' lively, crowd-pleasing and — given the horrors of the East Coast storms and the abiding comedic quality of the material — very well-timed Broadway revival...all has the feeling of a live version of a star-laden holiday TV special, with many of the same pluses and minuses…As a solve-it-yourself, self-aware musical, ""Drood"" presents some traps, not all of which are here fully avoided. At various points, one has to force oneself to re-engage with the grand questions of the plot, which are not always tracked as adroitly as would be ideal. The best productions of ""Drood"" manage, at least in the final number, to exploit the way the lyrics allow the clutter of the show to fall away — and to help us ponder a few broader matters of life and death, at least in passing. That never happens here. But that was bothering almost no one inside Studio 54. Block, who seems relieved not to carry the entire enterprise, sounds particularly spectacular, as does Betsy Wolfe as the ripe ingenue Rosa Bud. Rivera, as one might imagine, could not be a more delightful presence in any romp in town.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,11/13/12
2,Come From Away,8,Broadway review: Come from Away takes off on Broadway,"Although the residual shock of 9/11 gives it a strong current of emotion, Come from Away's multiple narratives mostly have low stakes; it's essentially a show about a bunch of people inconvenienced at once. When it touches on weightier concerns-one passenger is the mother of a missing firefighter-it falters; it is better at celebrating less consequential things, like a rowdy evening of initiation at a local bar, where the visitors are urged to kiss a cod and try a local rum called screech. A band of eight plays the spirited, Celtic-accented score, heavy on fiddle and bodhran and flute. Under Christopher Ashley's fluid direction, the 12 versatile actors form a true ensemble cast, playing dozens of roles as both the Plane People and the plain people who welcome them to their rock...Despite minor stumbles of craft, Come from Away makes a persuasive case for the value of good intentions. For this kind of uplift you don't need planes.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,3/12/17

Designed by Beowulf Boritt, this cityscape makes the original set for ""Sweeney Todd"" at the old Uris Theater look like a kids' jungle gym...The producer in Hart's book wasn't sure about the word ""noisy."" Regarding Lapine's ""Act One,"" the word ""fast"" is closer to the mark...Shalhoub also does triple duty, playing not only the mature Hart and Hart's father but Kaufman, as well.

The ever-amazing Langella keeps this watchable for as long as possible, giving us an André who is alternately charming and irksome, pitiable and pathetic. But by the time this poor man is getting slapped around (or is he?) by a man who may or may not be his son-in-law, ""The Father"" has turned repetitive and sour.

But theatergoers willing to dive into the sea of ellipses in this mordant, melancholy existential sitcom will find the waters bracing...Is The Realistic Joneses an ideal fit for Broadway? Not if the uncomfortable audience behavior at a press performance a few nights prior to opening was any indication. The anxious smattering of applause during scene changes seems a symptom of a crowd unsure how to react but conditioned to believe that star talent demands some noise. While the play is stuffed with droll wordplay and wry comic observations that hit the mark, you can also feel much of its humor and poetry not quite landing - getting lost in the airy space of a large auditorium.

He suddenly reverses their backstories or presents unseen sides to their personalities that upend what the audience thinks it knows...While Billy's coming of age is tinged with melodrama by McDonagh's fervid plotting, he and his fellow Inishmaan residents remain memorable and richly drawn, providing an evening of boisterous theatricality that overlays buried empathy for our shared human frailties.",Associated Press,Jennifer Farrar,4/20/14

Hudgens gives the sort of sincere but clumsy performance you'd expect to see in, well, a high school musical.

It helps to have a bona fide (and certifiably bankable) star like Nathan Lane casting his glow in the title role of a Depression-era comic who plays ""pansy parts"" in burlesque shows.

Directed and choreographed by The Book of Mormon's Casey Nicholaw (and produced by, among others, Lorne Michaels, who surveyed this preview performance with the same inscrutable, puckered expression caught occasionally by the cameras of Saturday Night Live) Mean Girls, at the August Wilson Theatre, stays true to the plot (and well-remembered jokes and catchphrases) of the film while smoothly updating the high school mischief-making for the age of social media.",Deadline,Greg Evans,4/8/18

She amps up Gigi's moments of rebellion from her chosen path...That would all be well and good if Hudgens had got the memo. But for most of this show she comes up with the most girlie Gigi you could possibly imagine: it is as if she were told to be as chirpy and childlike as possible, skipping around the stage and, at times, bending at the waist like a rag doll...Hudgens is, for sure, sincere and working hard. But her safe-as-the-valley Gigi feels Californian all the way and, well, not even remotely French. Actually, nothing in this show (and I include both the earnest McGillin and the setting by Derek McLane, replete with a mini Eiffel Tower) feels even remotely French.

Lithgow is droll and manor-born as the retired Tobias, though we never believe he is as ineffectual as Agnes claims. Oddly, Close, who has three best-actress Tonys, seemed daunted at a recent preview by Agnes' exhilarating but Olympian monologues. Stumbling over the words is a special problem for a silver fox who fancies herself the fulcrum of the family's equilibrium...instead of upsetting the balance of self-satisfied old money, the scene screams ostentation.

Whereas the previous Off-Broadway production was performed in the round, no impact has been lost in the transition to a traditional proscenium theater. The score - which contains airy folk-pop for the lovers and a livelier jazz idiom for the denizens of the underworld - comes off as distinctive and authentic by Broadway standards.

Jon Robin Baitz, a gay liberal humanist, has delivered them a doozy with ""Other Desert Cities,"" his off-Broadway hit, which has now ripened admirably on Broadway. Power, passion, and superbly crafted palaver stippled with blowdarts of wit-this is what Baitz (""The Substance of Fire,"" TV's ""Brothers and Sisters"") does best. He's written his favorite sort of story, a simple tale of parents and children and blame ... in which the legacy of the Old American Century and the unsteady prospect of a new one just happen to be at stake.",NY Magazine,Scott Brown,11/3/11
2,Children of a Lesser God,7,"Review: Sound, or Silence? A Passionate Debate in ‘Children of a Lesser God’","The pungency of sign language is not the subject of Mark Medoff's ""Children of a Lesser God,"" which opened on Wednesday at Studio 54 in a mixed bag of a Broadway revival directed by Kenny Leon. But it's a wonderful bonus to the play's fierce rivalry between those who promote spoken English as the highest attainable form of communication and those who are staunch partisans of silence.",New York Times,Jesse Green,4/11/18
2,The Nance,6,"‘The Nance’ review: Superb Nathan Lane, disappointing play","So even when material lets him down, which it finally does in ""The Nance,"" Douglas Carter Beane's splendidly ambitious but psychologically superficial tragicomedy, it's thrilling to watch Lane bond with a character who demands the full attention of so many gifted layers of him.",Newsday,Linda Winer,4/15/13
1,A Night With Janis Joplin,6,Theater review: 'A Night With Janis Joplin',"On a set oddly decorated with clusters of small table lamps, she pierces the air with primal, lung-bursting screams and screeches, storming through such Joplin hits as ""Me and Bobby McGee,"" ""Mercedes Benz,"" ""Piece of My Heart"" and ""Ball and Chain,"" as well as a deconstruction of Gershwin's ""Summertime"" that's deeply emotional, if barely recognizable. Davies' fervent singing italicizes Joplin's role as a rock pioneer, a strong-willed, free-spirited performer who was as tough and distinctive as the most notable male singers.",Bergen Record,Robert Feldberg,10/10/13
0,Bonnie & Clyde,4,Wheel This Barrow Out of Town,"'Bonnie & Clyde' isn't the worst musical to open on Broadway in the past decade. It isn't even the worst Frank Wildhorn musical to open on Broadway in the past decade. (That would be ""Dracula."") It is, however, quite sufficiently bad enough to qualify for the finals of this year's What-Were-They-Thinking Prize. Why would anyone not obviously deranged put money into a show with music by a composer whose last three Broadway outings tanked? And who thought it was a good idea to write a commodity musical whose title gives the impression that ""Bonnie & Clyde"" is based (even though it isn't) on a 44-year-old movie that is no longer well remembered save by upper-middle-age baby boomers? Nor have Mr. Wildhorn and his feckless collaborators managed to beat these long odds: ""Bonnie & Clyde"" is so enervatingly bland and insipid that you'll leave the theater asking yourself why you ever liked musicals in the first place.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,12/1/11
0,Meteor Shower,5,"Review Amy Schumer and Keegan-Michael Key lend star power to 'Meteor Shower,' but it's still space junk","The laughter is definitely more raucous on Broadway than it was in San Diego. The daffy non-sequiturs are delivered with lunatic aplomb. Everything is crisper, including the modern Californian home in Ojai (designed by Beowulf Boritt to tickle Broadway theatergoers' fetish for flashy real estate). The blasts of Beethoven and the jaunty celestial displays between scenes accentuate the briskness of Zaks' staging. But the play is still the play, which is to say it's barely a play at all. ""Meteor Shower"" is really a collection of funny (in both senses of the word) lines, packaged together with a few conceptual ideas tossed about in a manner that can seem random even if there's an all-too-tidy explanation written into this new version of the script.",LA Times,Charles McNulty,11/29/17
0,Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark,5,"'Spider-Man' has improved, but still shallow","But at the same time, it remains little more than a kid-friendly stunt spectacular with glitzy superhero costumes, bad songs and a few cheesy laughs.

2,Straight White Men,7,"Review: ‘Straight White Men,’ Now Checking Their Privilege on Broadway","The casting of shiny actors like Mr. Hammer (of ""Call Me By Your Name"") and Mr. Charles (of ""The Good Wife"") has the perverse effect - though they are both spot on - of making the play seem mainstream. So does Ms. Shapiro's direction, which is confident and highly polished; even the boys' mortifying, half-remembered rec-room dance routines are snappily choreographed, by Faye Driscoll.",New York Times,Jesse Green,7/23/18
2,My Fair Lady,9,Broadway Review: ‘My Fair Lady’,"If you've got it, flaunt it. The splendid Beaumont stage at Lincoln Center was made for great classic musicals like Lerner and Loewe's ""My Fair Lady,"" and helmer Bartlett Sher was born to stage them. This jubilant revival is meticulously mounted and entirely welcome - despite the eccentric casting choice of Lauren Ambrose as Eliza Doolittle.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,4/19/18
2,The Heiress,9,Review: Chastain gets ugly in 'The Heiress',"The latest revival of ""The Heiress"" has done the near impossible - it's drained the light from one of the most luminous actresses working today. In a good way. Jessica Chastain, that ravishing redhead with the milky skin who shot a dose of bubbly charm to the film ""The Help,"" turns almost ghoulish in the title role…What's left is a skittish woman with hollow eyes, a simply horrible hostess who, when she speaks, does so in a dull monotone. Even her hair looks mousy. Full credit goes to Chastain, who has buried herself in dullness to play one of theater's more formidable proto-feminist roles. The men in her life - David Strathairn plays her father and Dan Stevens of ""Downton Abbey"" her suitor - aren't too shabby either, each turning in performances that are complex and sympathetic. Neither actor, under the superb, subtle direction of Moises Kaufman, emerges as a straw man.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,11/1/12
0,Catch Me If You Can,3,'Catch Me' fumbles at Neil Simon Theatre,"News that the guys from ""Hairspray"" and ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" were making a musical based on the movie ""Catch Me If You Can"" raised a couple of intriguing -- also daunting -- questions.

0,Meteor Shower,8,"‘Meteor Shower’ Broadway Review: Amy Schumer Sizzles, Steve Martin Fizzles","Steve Martin has taken what might have made a good story for one of his New Yorker ""Shouts & Murmurs"" columns and turned it into a full-length play for Broadway - assuming you consider 80 minutes full-length. ""Meteor Shower,"" which opened Wednesday at the Booth Theatre, would be consistently hilarious if the comedy could be watched in the time it takes to read one of his New Yorker columns. The other 60 or so minutes of Martin's new play is little more than set-up and filler, often repeated.",The Wrap,Robert Hofler,11/29/17
2,The Iceman Cometh,8,'The Iceman Cometh': Theater Review,"The surest way to get as pickled as the self-deceiving regulars at Harry Hope's downtown New York dive bar in The Iceman Cometh would be to take a shot of whiskey every time someone says ""pipe dreams."" Eugene O'Neill was seldom one to go easy on emphatic repetition of his themes, and the playwright's bleak vision of men drowning their deferred plans in cheap booze can be as prolix as it is poetic. George C. Wolfe's revival feels on some levels like it's still cohering, the underlying despair remaining muted for too much of the three-hour-45-minute running time. But it comes together in a powerful final act driven by the searing confessional monologue of Denzel Washington's Hickey.",The Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,4/26/18
2,Noises Off,9,‘Noises Off’ Review: Nine Doors to Delight,"This revival is as glorious as ""Wolf Hall"" was dull, not least because it features Tracee Chimo, the most gifted young comic actor to hit Broadway in recent memory...The secret ingredient of his production is that Mr. Herrin has gone to similar lengths to ensure that every member of the cast plays for truth, not laughs -- which makes you laugh twice as hard. This brings us to the miraculous Ms. Chimo, who plays Poppy, the mousy assistant stage manager of ""Nothing On,"" who's been sleeping with the director of the show (Campbell Scott) on the sly. Her performance is so heartbreakingly true to life that it would make you cry were you to see it in isolation. In the context of ""Noises Off,"" though, it's funny almost beyond belief...Complaints? I've got none. This show is flawless.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,1/14/16
2,Tootsie,8,‘Tootsie’: A Fun-Time Musical for Turbulent Times,"Let's hear it for Tootsie, the laugh-out-loud funniest musical of the Broadway season. Yes, it's another tune-filled spin on a hit movie - Pretty Woman, King Kong, the list goes on. But this one is actually good - hell, better than good, it's musical-comedy heaven. Using the beloved 1982 movie with Dustin Hoffman as a launching pad, the singing-dancing Tootsie still features an unemployed asshole of an actor who has to dress up as a woman to land a part. But the film's casual sexism (it celebrates a dude who finds himself) has been updated for the #MeToo era, going from retro to woke and slamming the door on patrimony with a mighty Times Up.",Rolling Stone,Peter Travers,4/23/19
0,If/Then,6,Review: Menzel shines but 'If/Then' too sloppy,"The tonal difference between the two acts is striking. A whimsical comedy in the first is taken over by a series of tragedies and sadness. One of the best crafted scenes and songs - ""The Moment Explodes"" - will brings gasps, and not just because it's a bit too manipulative. It's set on a plane in trouble. Sometimes, real tragedies intrude on Broadway...Credit goes for attempting to explore parallel lives onstage and the acting is great. But a show with so much potential is marred by poor editing. So, the overall answer is, if you really, really need to see and hear Menzel, then go and watch an actress wonderfully giving it her all. But if you're of two minds, then go see ""Frozen"" and just listen to her voice.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,3/30/14
2,Man and Boy,7,The Art of Wreaking Havoc With Other People’s Money,But the main raison d'être of this production - and the one compelling reason to see it - is the occasion it gives its star to explore the pathology of power. Few performers are as good as Mr. Langella at using an actor's instinctive narcissism to capture the egomania that fuels (and sometimes topples) the wildly successful.,New York Times,Ben Brantley,10/9/11
2,The King and I,9,'The King and I' review: Sumptuous musical theater,"Director Bartlett Sher's sweepingly romantic production aches with deep, unforced understanding of the story's East/West cultural divide while luxuriating in the sumptuous pleasures of the 1951 Rodgers and Hammerstein classic...the king himself is now powerfully inhabited by Ken Watanabe...Contrary to rumored problems with his pronunciation, every word is as clear as the impact behind it. The coupling of the actor with O'Hara as the English schoolteacher is inspired -- full of aching attraction and the impossible tension of smart, beautiful people from different worlds. O'Hara, with her silvery pinpoint vocal precision and her natural empathy, creates an Anna of fierce, caring intelligence. Watanabe, who shaved his head but is nothing like Brynner, is imposingly tall, masculine yet enormously vulnerable as the ruler of an isolated, male-dominated world and whose doubts about modernization eventually break both their hearts...How good to be getting to know the show all over again.",Newsday,Linda Winer,4/16/15
2,Springsteen On Broadway,10,No doubt about it. Bruce Springsteen belongs on Broadway.,"""Springsteen on Broadway"" - now there's a Jersey Boy - had its official opening Thursday night, in a taut and beautifully turned-out evening as sincerely wrought as a poetry reading. For sure, Springsteen rocks out a bit and tells some funny stories on himself. But onstage for two hours minus the E Street Band, and with Patti Scialfa - born like her husband on the Jersey Shore - appearing with him for two of the show's 16 songs, Springsteen is determined to maintain a mostly elegiac tone on this occasion. He's a musician on a mission. And it's a quest for a New York audience to listen for the craft in an American voice ringing with simple truths.",Washington Post,Peter Marks,10/12/17
0,Tootsie,7,‘Tootsie’ on Broadway: A Cross-Dressing Classic Gets a Large Spoonful of Woke,"Tootsie as a musical is a confusing mélange, and not for the sexual and romantic attractions and farce-heavy confusions it sets in motion by lead character Michael Dorsey's (Santino Fontana) cross-dressing. The Broadway version of the 1982 movie-which starred Dustin Hoffman as Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels-is both chaotic and apologetic, with a sharper and better book than it has music.",Daily Beast,Tim Teeman,4/23/19
0,Groundhog Day,6,‘Groundhog Day’ review,"It would be nice to report that, despite these travails, the show, with a book by Danny Rubin, who co-wrote the 1993 movie, and a score by Tim Minchin, of ""Matilda"" renown, deserves the plaudits it has already received in London, including an Olivier Award for best musical and another for Karl as leading actor. But I'm afraid the production, simultaneously frenetic and static, left me just about as glum as its protagonist is at curtain rise. Life would be grim indeed if I had to wake up and face this tedious, charm-free and often tasteless show again day after day.",Broadway News,Charles Isherwood,4/17/17
2,Bright Star,8,Review: ‘Bright Star’ Beams Nostalgia Underscored by Fiddles and Banjos,"The musical is gentle-spirited, not gaudy, and moves with an easygoing grace where others prance and strut. And it tells a sentiment-spritzed story...that you might be more likely to encounter in black and white, flickering from your flat-screen on Turner Classic Movies. The protagonist, Alice Murphy, portrayed by Carmen Cusack -- making a simply gorgeous Broadway debut -- is a spunky girl in her late teens in the scenes set in the 1920s. A dreamer with a rebellious streak and a hunger for literature, she's causing a fine ruckus in the sleepy town of Zebulon...While the story certainly skirts (if not embraces) sentimentality and the overripeness of melodrama, the production's soft-hued style -- and the sometimes wry tone of Mr. Martin's book -- keeps it from curdling into treacle. The songs boast simple but seductive melodies, and lyrics that have a sweet, homespun quality.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,3/24/16
1,Don't Dress For Dinner,6,Broadway review: 'Don’t Dress for Dinner',"I found “Don’t Dress for Dinner” to be head-knockingly convoluted. So do its characters, as they try to explain what’s going on as the two-act moves to resolve itself; part of the gag is that when they attempt to sort everything out, you can’t follow a thing they are saying past the first two sentences...In the end, it didn’t matter, since the situation of the moment becomes clear with a nastily aimed squirt of a seltzer bottle or a shove that has people falling over the side of a couch. It is farce, after all. And it is, after all is said, fun.",Philadelphia Inquirer,Howard Shapiro,4/26/12
2,Indecent,9,'Indecent' Brings Untold Story of Jewish History to Forefront,"With a company of seven actors rising from the ashes of history to tell the story of those lost before them, a literal stream of gray ash pouring from their sleeves as they move around the stage. Frankly, I would have been crying too like many of those around me, but I was holding my breath instead - stunned by the sheer beauty and sadness of it all. Director Rebecca Taichman...has many more gems like that throughout her beautiful and arresting staging...It would be hard to find a weak link among the cast...Playing a handful of roles each, you'll marvel as they lose and gain costume pieces, accents and mannerisms to bring the many voices involved in this play's past to life. A standout is the graceful Katrina Lenk...The ""Once"" alum will break your heart with her fragility and passion, especially as the show reaches its tragic end.",NBC New York,Dave Quinn,4/18/17
2,An Enemy of the People,8,'Enemy of the People' review: Fine Ibsen,"Don't be put off by any grumbles about the conversational, tightened two-hour adaptation that the Manhattan Theatre Club uses for the rare Broadway production of this timely classic.

2,The Heiress,8,Theater Review: 'The Heiress',"While ""The Heiress"" might fall short of being great dramatic literature, it does make for an entertaining star vehicle filled with elaborate turn-of-the-century costumes, references to high society and plenty of bold dramatic gestures…what really distinguishes [Chastain's] performance, which marks her Broadway debut, is how she convincingly evolves from an insecure, loving young girl into a steely, bitter woman. Stevens, who plays Matthew Crawley on the English television series ""Downton Abbey,"" also makes a fine New York stage debut, hiding his character's unsavory motives behind a sunny, guileless facade. Strathairn maintains a dour disposition to the role of the doctor, while Judith Ivey brings a sweet and lively presence as Catherine's warm aunt Lavinia.",amNY,Matt Windman,11/1/12
0,Our Mother's Brief Affair,4,'Our Mother's Brief Affair': Theater Review,"It takes some doing to stifle the prickly humor of Linda Lavin, but Our Mother's Brief Affair makes her character both an unreliable narrator and one who's astringent to the point of unpleasantness...A madly overworked but underdeveloped little piece, it mistakes narration for dramatization, and verbiage for genuine feeling...Greenberg has reached for the elusive links between past, present and future before, in richer and more compelling ways. And while Meadow's actors are all quite accomplished, they struggle to find any heart in characters so unrelentingly ""written"" that it sucks the life out of them, giving us no reason to care.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,1/20/16
2,The Realistic Joneses,8,The Realistic Joneses,"The actors are excellent, playing the minimalist music of the lines without losing warmth or individuality; if it's possible to make us care deeply about characters intentionally fashioned as gnomic ciphers, these fine performers come closest. Whether or not you share Eno's severe, brittle and frankly despairing view of existence, there's much to savor: the dry but meaningful banter, the joy of humans sharing time and space, battling the darkness with a joke or silence. Life in Enoland isn't what you'd call realistic-it's more real than that.",Time Out NY,David Cote,4/6/14
1,Jersey Boys,7,'Boys' hits right notes in homage to Valli,"In following its working-class heroes as they climb the ladder up to fortune and fame, Boys offers a familiar blend of self-conscious populism and knee-jerk sentimentality. Luckily, co-librettists Rick Elice and veteran film and TV writer Marshall Brickman — whose previous collaborators include Woody Allen, Johnny Carson and Dick Cavett — manage to mitigate the muck with flashes of easygoing wit. Director Des McAnuff, who cut his rock 'n' roll teeth overseeing the Broadway debut of The Who's Tommy, also helps keep the proceedings brisk and breezy. Scenic designer Klara Zieglerova fashions a whimsical tone, with campy period cartoons projected on screens.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,11/7/05
0,The Mountaintop,2,'The Mountaintop',"The show's production team has asked reviewers not to reveal any plot twists, but let's just say it turns what had previously been a mediocre biodrama into a ridiculous embarrassment.

1,A Night With Janis Joplin,8,"Little Girl Blue Howls Again, but Talks Sensibly, Too","Ms. Davies portrays both sides of Janis, I should add. And while she bears a notable physical resemblance to Joplin, and her speaking voice has the same whisper of a twang and down-home earthiness, I'm a little suspicious of that second character. If the real Joplin had the kind of sensible perspective on her life and career that she exhibits in this show - happily reminiscing about her youthful love of painting, or giving a learned docent tour of blues history - she would probably not have died of an overdose of heroin and alcohol at 27...There remains a strange disjunction between the soul-baring singer and the woman calmly telling us that ""the blues is just a good woman feelin' bad,"" or ""the blues are a way out of where you are, and they can drag you to where you're going,"" or ""it's the want of something that gives you the blues, man."" The Janis we meet in ""A Night With Janis Joplin"" spends so much time talking about the blues, you begin to wonder when she had time to truly suffer them.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,10/10/13

In creating costumes for Cher over the years - costumes that often tell the story of a shy woman emerging triumphant from a chrysalis - the designer Bob Mackie has kept on the right side of the line by making sure the level of craft supports the extravagance of the gesture. Sadly that's not the case with ""The Cher Show,"" the maddening mishmash of a new musical that opened on Monday at the Neil Simon Theater. Except for the dozens of eye-popping outfits Mr. Mackie gorgeously recreates for the occasion, it's all gesture, no craft: dramatically threadbare and surprisingly unrevealing.",New York Times,Jesse Green,12/3/18

So it's remarkable when a flash of clarity comes in the Roundabout's stylized revival...Hodge, a Tony-winning actor, adds his own abstractions...The pleasures of the production come from watching three excellent actors...confidently wind through the words, pauses and poses. Owen (""The Knick"") works his craggy good looks and is alternately rogueish and vulnerable. Reilly (""True Detective"") looks the picture of pretty melancholy with her perennially pursed lips, but eventually reveals a sharp tongue.

If brevity is the soul of wit, then 75 minutes without an intermission might be the soul of absurdist theatre, so at two and a half hours the madness of Travesties can get a little maddening.

2,Carousel,7,‘Carousel’ Review: It Has Its Ups and Downs,"Of the musicals by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II that continue to hold the stage, ""Carousel"" is-up to a point-the strongest. That point arrives toward the end, when the ghost of Billy Bigelow, the show's romantic antihero, returns to earth, watches his daughter graduate from high school and is escorted back to the Pearly Gates by an angel as the company sings a reprise of ""You'll Never Walk Alone,"" the stickiest song that Rodgers and Hammerstein ever wrote (though the competition is stiff).",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,4/12/18
2,Death of a Salesman,7,"American Dreamer, Ambushed by the Territory","Emotional distance sprang, for me at least, from a feeling of disconnection between the leading actors (all, I would argue, miscast) and their characters. ... Mr. Hoffman, Ms. Emond and Mr. Garfield all bring exacting intelligence and intensity to their performances. They make thought visible, but it’s the thought of actors making choices rather than of characters living in the moment. Their reading of certain lines makes you hear classic dialogue anew but with intellectual annotations. It’s as if they were docents showing us through Loman House, now listed on the Literary Register of Historic Places. ... Two performances stand out, luminous and palpable, for their authenticity. As Happy, the younger son forever in pursuit of Dad’s affection, Finn Wittrock provides a funny, poignant and ripely detailed study in virile vanity as a defense system. Bill Camp, as Charley, Willy’s wisecracking next-door neighbor, wears on his face an entire lifetime of philosophical compromises, small victories and protective cynicism. And he speaks so deeply from character that he makes even a line like 'Nobody dast blame this man' sound as natural as 'hello.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,3/15/12
2,Peter and the Starcatcher,8,Peter and the Starcatcher Review: Better on Broadway,"“Peter and the Starcatcher” is also still, for my taste, too long and busy for what it is; it is still a struggle to stay engaged throughout. It is best to appreciate the play if you don’t expect it to do for Peter Pan what “Wicked” does for The Wizard of Oz – best, in other words, to see it not as a clever take on a beloved story but as a new entertainment with its own delights. But the Broadway production brings more Peter Pan into the show, especially a scene built around a J.M. Barrie line that could be the slogan for this successful transfer: “To have faith is to have wings.”",Faster Times,Jonathan Mandell,4/15/12
2,Dear Evan Hansen,10,"Theater Review: Dear Evan Hansen Moves Uptown, and Gains Something Indefinable","The big problem in writing great musicals is not the difficulty of writing great songs. The big problem is that the songs, great or not, are cannibals, picking the stories clean and leaving a pile of bones. It's a zero-sum system. In musical dramas the problem is even worse, as innumerable failed adaptations of huge 18th-century novels have proved. (They often seem like Cliffs Notes of Cliffs Notes.) But when a musical drama clicks, an amazing fusion event occurs: The songs and the story enlarge each other in the process of becoming inseparable. Think of Sweeney Todd or, more intimately, Fun Home. And now add to the list Dear Evan Hansen, which opened tonight in a production beautifully directed by Michael Greif. I called the Off Broadway production at Second Stage this May ""the feel-anxious musical of the season."" But it is even better on Broadway, so fine in its craft and rich its gathering of themes that, like the best works of any genre, it rewards being seen again - and again.",Vulture,Jesse Green,12/4/16

We're left wondering what significance the orchestra's time in Bet Hatikva will have for the characters, but one thing is certain: they'd never fess up to it. ""Once, not long ago, a group of musicians came to Israel, from Egypt,"" Dina says after the band departs, retreating back to her café and her poker face. ""You probably didn't hear about it.

Rando (""Urinetown"") mines the script for all its boisterous humor and smartly makes space for hushed interludes...Choreographer Joshua Bergasse keeps the fleet of agile and athletic dancers leaping, kicking and spinning like a top. The cast is top-to-bottom excellent. In sailor suits and stipped to their skivvies, Johnson and Alves are adorable and able-bodied. Umphress adds sass and brass as the go-for-it taxi driver, and Stanley is delicious as the oversexed scientist.

In other words, Cumming is better than ever -- wiser, more dissipated, even more deeply entertaining in the role he stunningly recreated from Joel Grey's iconic original. And that freshness is so infectious it spills over into a landmark production that closed in 2004 but feels, with one uneasy exception, as confident -- and about as dangerous -- as if it has been running ever since. The exception, alas, is Michelle Williams, making her Broadway and musical debut as Sally Bowles...Her Sally is timid, bland and covered up in costumes that make her seem almost chaste.",Newsday,Linda Winer,4/24/14

Mulligan is calm and measured - and even at her most self-righteous, she never sounds like she's preaching. She even makes the melodramatic move of tossing a drawer of silverware work.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,4/2/15
1,King Lear,7,REVIEW: Glenda Jackson is extraordinary as Shakespeare’s mad monarch in uneven production of ‘King Lear’,"Like a lot of intense, progressive, secular work in this time of revolutionary exploration on Broadway, Gold's ""King Lear"" just has a better understanding of what needs to go than what needs to take its place. It wrestles mightily with the play's inherent moralism, religiosity and conservatism, and its demands that we feel our obligations. It seems to say that the old white guys made their mess all on their own.",New York Daily News,Chris Jones,4/4/19

1,Fish in the Dark,7,Review: Curb Your Enthusiasm for Larry David’s Fish in the Dark,"David's first Broadway play...runs barely two hours, but it seems padded out, overpopulated (18 characters -- enough for a Shakespeare history play!), and funny only in spurts. It's great to see David, the star and creator of the popular HBO series Curb Your Enthusiasm, taking a crack at Broadway. But for all the audience's indulgent laughter and the obligatory standing ovation at the end, one can't help but detect a certain, well, lack of enthusiasm...On Curb Your Enthusiasm...David proved himself a master of structure: weaving three or four storylines each week into a neat, 30-minute operetta of comic angst. With a two-act play to fill up, David has made everything bigger...Onstage, David is bigger too. His whiny voice and perplexed expressions are perfectly sized for the small screen. Here he has to project his trademark shrug to the back of the mezzanine -- hunching up his shoulders and stretching his arms so wide he looks like a seagull coming in for a landing at Kennedy Airport...for a comedy writer who practically reinvented the TV sitcom, it's surprising to see how clumsy and old-fashioned David's playwriting is.",Time,Richard Zoglin,3/5/15
1,Act One,6,Theater review: 'Act One',"Moss Hart's autobiography ""Act One"" was big news in 1959. But are people interested in a man whose fame on Broadway happened well over a half-century ago?

2,Violet,9,STAGE REVIEW Violet,"As musicals go, the story couldn't be simpler. Yet the material couldn't be richer...As Violet travels from the Blue Ridge Mountains to Memphis to Tulsa, the music moves from warm, soul-stirring folk-the bulk and heart of the score-to smoky R&B and blues to full-throated gospel and back again. It's impossible not to get swept up by rousing numbers...And, more important, you'll have to imagine Violet's facial scar, the result of an ax blade swung accidentally by her father when she was a girl; Foster's face remains unblemished. Of course, from the start, you know she's on a fool's journey. But you'll never regret taking the ride.",Entertainment Weekly,Entertainment Weekly,4/20/14
2,Noises Off,9,‘Noises Off’ review: Michael Frayn farce revival is riotous,"There's no need for reinvention when it comes to ""Noises Off""...For ""Noises Off"" to work on a basic level, its thoroughly intricate physical activity must be staged with the precision of a ballet. But a great production, which this revival certainly is, builds the slapstick around truthful performances, thus making the chaos feel natural...Jeremy Herrin, who recently staged ""Wolf Hall"" on Broadway, has brought together a dynamic ensemble cast of stage veterans...Hilty is especially memorable as a buxom, airheaded actress, often waving her arms like a cheerleader doing a routine, and Shamos is endearing as a sensitive actor who gets nosebleeds at the slightest hint of violence.",amNY,Matt Windman,1/14/16
1,Tuck Everlasting,6,"Broadway 'Tuck Everlasting' keeps things light, even things like life and death","The score, by Chris Miller, has echoes of ""Finian's Rainbow"" and ""Brigadoon"" and often showcases the sound of flute or penny whistle. And the choreography, by director Casey Nicholaw, is balletic, pretty, interested in the social dance forms of the 19th century and fundamentally circular, sending the ensemble members swirling through the years. Even much of the acting is plumby and fantastical. For a competent Broadway show aiming to capture the family market, such a safe approach is hardly unreasonable...But it removes much of the tension from a story filled with agonizing decision-making and enough talk of life and death to keep anyone awake at night.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,4/26/16

1,First Date,5,Meet Cute and Prosper,"Does any of the following sound familiar? An instant lack of rapport; a growing aversion as the minutes pass; a mysterious sense that time has suddenly stopped; a desperate hope that the apocalypse will arrive, preferably right this minute. Magnify those feelings, set them to bland pop-rock music, and you'll have some idea of the oodles of fun I didn't have during my evening at ""First Date,"" the singing sitcom that opened on Thursday night at the Longacre Theater...I have been harsh on this modest musical, efficiently if facelessly directed by Bill Berry, so I should underscore that Mr. Levi and Ms. Rodriguez are both appealing performers. Although his singing is merely adequate, Mr. Levi brings a vitality and off-kilter humor to his performance...Ms. Rodriguez has the drearier role - it's obvious that the show was written by three guys, since only the female characters are accessorized with flaws - but her singing is ardent and assured.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,8/8/13
2,Evita,9,Evita: Theater Review,"While Buenos Aires-born Roger is new to Broadway, this production made her a star in London, where it originated in 2006. At the risk of sounding harsh, the actress is physically unprepossessing – short and beaky – not to mention occasionally shrill in the vocal department. But she acts the hell out of the role. ... The other bit of headline casting is Ricky Martin as Che. Moving away from the original production’s clear allusions to Che Guevara, he appears here as an enigmatic peasant worker who serves as the bio-musical’s narrator and its voice of skepticism, seeing the beatified “Santa Evita” for the ravenous spotlight-seeker she really is. His dramatic presence could be more aggressive, but Martin’s Latin-pop vocals are a smooth fit for the role, and his relaxed charm and dreamboat looks will yield few complaints. Fans eager for him to bust some serious dance moves have to wait until midway through Act II, but he eventually turns on the trademark sizzle.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,4/5/12
2,Burn This,8,"Theater Review: Men Behaving Bigly, in Burn This and Socrates","But Driver keeps the show aloft. Turns out Kylo Ren is immensely compelling onstage - a genuine weirdo in the hulking, strangely graceful body of a former Marine, unafraid of huge, ugly displays of emotion, blazing through Pale's aggrieved, hilarious, F-word-peppered rants with the dexterity of a dancer like Robbie. At one point, he gently puts his hand on Russell's breastbone, and it's genuinely unsettling how much of her tiny torso his big human paw covers. He's an unstoppable force and an immovable object. And he's funny as heck. Whether he's steaming over the injustices of the world - ""Half my fuckin' adult life, I swear to Christ, has been spent looking for a place to park!"" - or padding around the room wearing one of Anna's little happi coats, struggling to get his enormous limbs through the weird double armholes, Driver's got a keen sense for comedy of multiple sizes, from the subtle background lazzo to the over-the-top tirade. It's fun to watch him interact with Uranowitz's wonderfully wry Larry - who can't help smiling, as if from behind his hand, at such a splattery, honest display of personality - and with Furr's Burton, who's sympathetic despite his many blind spots, and who really doesn't mean to bust out his aikido training on Pale. Pale just has a way of ... bringing things out in people.",Vulture,Sara Holdren,4/16/19
1,Saint Joan,6,Review: A ‘Saint Joan’ That Needs More Belief and Burning Passion,"In this under-charged production of Shaw's 1923 play, first performed three years after Joan of Arc's canonization by the Roman Catholic Church, Rashad plays the iconic martyr as a lost-seeming, somewhat dreamy young woman. As directed by Daniel Sullivan, she is resolute, but gently so.

He has brought a seedy gadfly poet (McKellen) named Spooner home to his handsome, sparsely furnished house with the well-stocked liquor cabinet. They may have known each other at Oxford, or maybe not.

In these moments, and in Ms. Parsons's more than capable hands, Mr. Coble's play rises above its slightly formulaic structure to become a dry-eyed, moving rumination on the hard fact that the progress of human life being what it is, truly happy endings are rare indeed.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,4/21/14

The loose vibe seems to have extended to composer Jason Robert Brown, concocting a jaunty score quite unlike his more contemplative, romantic works of late. Vegas has its share of missteps -- a few clunker lines, a still-slightly-sexist undertone...and what has to be the only showtune in history about skin cancer.

But there are some clear missteps, notably the character of the hospital ghost who greets the dead Sam right after his murder. The ghost, which has been reworked since London, still isn’t right, an odd combination of vaudeville and soul that doesn’t fit this shocking moment. Overall, it’s an ambitious, carefully orchestrated work that raises the bar on technological innovation. In London, “Ghost The Musical” has become a hit. How will a Broadway audience likely respond?

The reasons to do so include both a familiar face in the cast and a few new ones.Alan Cumming, whose indelibly naughty, biting performance redefined the role of the Klub's Emcee, revisits the character with renewed senses of mischief and urgency that will leave you riveted, from the moment he introduces a deliciously bawdy Willkommen to his final, chilling adieu. The Scottish Cumming is joined by two of today's finest American stage actors, Linda Emond and Danny Burstein, who lend fresh insights...The real revelation of this Cabaret, though, is its leading lady, the film star Michelle Williams...Williams brings to the role a pained fragility that feels distinctive, and makes Sally's determination to not face either her past or the world crumbling around her especially poignant...It's a star turn that, even in this rich season, is truly unmissable -- as is this Cabaret in general.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,4/24/14

In particular, John Gallagher Jr. and Mackenzie Crook, as two of the latter-day Lost Boys who glom onto Johnny for fellowship and a reliable high in the woods, imbue their characters with authentic feels for the insecurities of young men unsure of their identities.

It is, in fact, the jolting difference between Rashad and her nurse, the ever-valuable Jayne Houdyshell, that invests their scenes with aliveness. The disparity between Rashad's timidity and the power of Chuck Cooper, as Lord Capulet, also drives the performance. Christian Camargo, so disturbingly good as the title character's older brother on TV's Dexter, brings a similar eerie intensity here to Mercutio.",Financial Times,Brendan Lemon,9/19/13

Ms. Shaw gives us that woman, for sure... But if you're going to give us a vision of Mary as we've never seen her, why would you block the view?...I was never happier - or more harrowed - than in those rare quiet, contained moments when this Mary made us feel that we were in a private tête-à-tête with a woman who had an extraordinary story to tell, and needed to keep telling it, forever and ever.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,4/22/13

The much-celebrated Hand to God uses a demonic sock puppet to send up rigid distinctions between good and evil in a Christian community. And at last check, The Book of Mormon wasn't having any trouble selling tickets. If Grace has the courage of its convictions, it shows less daring, and little invention, as a creative work.

Shively): ""a sweeping tale of pain and redemption."" But it cries out for an editor's sharp blue pen. Sweeping? In lieu of the color that the story seems to call for, Walter Bobbie's production is often actively plain, as though trying to hide its central bathos in beige. Painful? For the audience, perhaps, thanks to shoddy craftsmanship that saddles likable, plucky bluegrass music with lyrics that run from workmanlike to egregious.

Here, despite Nivola's bravura, the fireworks are better distributed, with Roger Rees, as the curmudgeon, mostly keeping in check his eagerness to amuse. Instead, he carefully delineates the steps along the path of the father's crisis, from gleeful chin-first aggression to obsession to exhaustion to resignation. And Michael Cumpsty, looking like a walking toothache, turns in a beautifully modulated comic performance as the nice man who will never get his girl.

It's a snapshot of lives far from New York and D.C. in flux. 9/11 is not the show's focus or even default focus: it is simply the event that has brought these people together. The show now finds itself in New York, site of the most iconic tragedy of that day-and a cheery rock-musical about 9/11 may not be the first theatrical choice for those to whom the city has long been home and who may have their own complex relationship to 9/11. For some, maybe the musical itself strikes a bum note: it is not set here, and it is not directly about the human tragedy of that day. But Come From Away doesn't trivialize the events of 9/11 or seek to facetiously co-opt them.

I like how'd-they-do-that stage trickery as much as the next wide-eyed theatergoer, but there's something unsatisfyingly slick about the fantastic spectacle that Mr. Mackintosh and his British colleagues have shipped across the Atlantic. The 1964 film of ""Mary Poppins"" was more than a little bit sticky around the edges, but it had heart, and it also had Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, and a brilliant supporting cast that included Hermione Baddeley, Jane Darwell, Glynis Johns, Elsa Lanchester and Ed Wynn.

1,Venus in Fur,8,Review: Venus in Fur,"For Broadway, director Walter Bobbie milks the script more; the action clocks in about ten minutes longer than it did at CSC. Although easing up on the accelerator gives us more time to savor the sensual-slapstick dance between Dancy and Arianda, it also means the climactic 20 minutes-as gender roles and power positions sharply flip-grow a tad overindulgently logy. Undaunted, Arianda maintains terrific tension at all times-as well as full comic release.",Time Out NY,David Cote,11/8/11
1,Farinelli and the King,8,'Farinelli and the King': Theater Review,"Unlike in Alan Bennett's play The Madness of George III, and its film adaptation, the deteriorating mental health of a monarch here doesn't constitute a sustaining narrative arc, even if Rylance's commanding performance remains the center of attention. (It's certainly the main reason for the production's Broadway transfer.) The more interesting thread is the motivation of Farinelli to keep extending his stay in Madrid, his love for Isabella becoming a contributing factor, and his refusal ever to sing in public again.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,12/17/2017

Alan Cumming won a Tony for the role 16 years ago. Beaming with creepy charisma, the sly Cumming is better than ever conjuring an androgynous bottom feeder whose smile hides something much darker and grimmer... a platinum-blond Williams assumes an English accent and an almost jolly and girlish demeanor flecked with desperation. She comes off so feathery that Sally could fly away -- except for her full-tilt go at the title song. Besides that final scene, Williams comes off paler and wispier than desired. Maybe next time.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,4/24/2014

But even with deep admiration for McDonald's potent acting, the evening feels out of balance. The details of Holiday's story are already well-known, so it doesn't have the allure of revelation. (The same material was covered last year in the off-Broadway bio-musical ""Lady Day."") What the production does offer that's fresh, exciting and irresistibly entertaining is McDonald singing Holiday.

Nothing wrong with that, but it takes real smarts to make dumb people funny. A string of easy puns and double entendres and faux XX-film titles like ?€?Spontaneass?€? aren?€?t enough to elevate this beyond a raunchy extended skit. Don?€?t read that as prudishness.

That's a shame, since there's plenty to play as Erie, who's down on his luck and living on illusions...Director Michael Grandage...comes up short with a production that lacks high points...Christopher Oram's scenic design is an unqualified success...If you tire of Whitaker's disconnected talk, gaze at the faded tin ceiling or the broken elevator.

If only some of that filthy lucre had gone to script doctors and ghostwriters instead...As Newton, Josh Young has a sterling, ringing tenor, but his character is annoyingly passive and shrill. The majestic Chuck Cooper brings every ounce of humor and dignity to bear on his invented role, the servant Thomas, steering it a hairsbreadth away from Magical Negro territory. Amazing Grace may be based on historical persons and events, but but in this case, truth is more compelling than fiction...Personally, I expect poetic license in the theater, but I expect it to serve a strong artistic or political vision.

0,Romeo and Juliet,5,Theater Reviews: Romeo and Juliet and Women or Nothing,"In the absence of all suspense - though not of pacing, which is fairly fleet, almost brisk - the show is taken over by spotlight supporting roles, most notably Jayne Houdyshell, who steals the show as Juliet's nurse. Houdyshell is, of course, a brilliant stage performer, but when the Nurse runs off with yourR&J, chances are it wasn't secured properly in the first place. Mercutio's another matter: As the only brilliant person in this rather dull crew of partisans, prigs and puppy-lovers - and thus the only crazy person, as well - he's designed to walk away with the whole shootin' match. Christian Camargo doesn't disappoint: A skinny-jeaned, leather-jacketed apparition, he's like some Billyburg poseur driven mad by the dawning recognition of his waning powers of bullshit. As a verbal duelist, Camargo's the very butcher of a silk button - he speaks in short stabbing motions, milks nothing, hits everything, jumps back before he's worn out his welcome.",Vulture,Scott Brown,9/19/2013

Director Kimberly Senior...shows an admirable restraint in her well-paced scenes...Dhillon, an American-born actor who's spent much of his career working in the U.K., shows more stiff-upper-lip reserve in the early scenes, merely pacing and fidgeting to signal Amir's discomfort in his own skin. It's an approach that doesn't go far enough to establish Amir's coiled volatility. The rest of the cast seem more attuned to the demands of the material; Mol in particular radiates a sensuous intelligence that is enormously appealing. B+",Entertainment Weekly,Thom Geier,10/23/2014

One could nip at ""Matilda's"" heels: the Broadway production, directed with great skill and a determined lack of sentimentality by Matthew Warchus, is a tad cool to the touch in spots...But that is about the only reasonable complaint.

0,Prince of Broadway,6,?€?Prince of Broadway?€? review,"Certainly the more than 30 songs performed by a superb cast of nine include some of the most beloved, or accomplished, ever written for musicals. A short list of the shows directed or produced (or both) by Prince ranges from the bouncy ""Damn Yankees"" to the storied collaborations with Stephen Sondheim - ""Company,"" ""Follies,"" ""A Little Night Music"" and ""Sweeney Todd"" among them - as well as two Andrew Lloyd Webber megahits, ""Evita"" and ""The Phantom of the Opera."" Plus ""Cabaret"" and ""Fiddler on the Roof."" But Prince's protean ability to infuse an electric vitality into shows of such disparate styles and tones almost confounds the revue format - or rather is confounded by it. Prince's work was often celebrated for its seamlessness, the fluid interplay between dialogue, song and dance, between story and character and theme.

The problem is that ""Outside Mullingar"" is only a romantic comedy for the last altogether enchanting scene. For the rest of John Patrick Shanley's 95-minute oddity, we are thrust into some cartoon universe, where rural Irish folk speak wisdom in kooky locutions, fester on peculiar grudges and debate whether shy, middle-aged, hardworking Anthony Reilly (O'Byrne) loves the farm enough to inherit it from his cranky old dad.",Newsday,Linda Winer,1/23/2014

That's pretty much the only sign of restraint in this overstuffed production...Holding it all together is Morrison. Sporting a beard and Scottish burr, he's tireless, if not especially charismatic, as J.M. Barrie...Barlow and Kennedy dutifully deliver the obligatory power ballads...but their heart is in the faster, livelier ensemble songs...Too bad Michaels' choreography has all the zest of vintage MTV. What's most striking is how a show about the power of whimsy and imagination is so lacking in both. Paulus and Company don't trust intimacy and charm, so everything is overplayed -- despite the advice to an actor rehearsing Barrie's ""Peter Pan"" to go ""smaller."" Peter Pan taught others to free themselves and fly. For most of its running time, ""Finding Neverland"" remains stuck to the ground.",NY Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,4/15/2015

As an old-fashioned architect, he can?€?t be faulted here. But he doesn?€?t furnish his rooms so that they feel genuinely lived in. The masterly director Daniel Sullivan (who also staged ?€?Proof?€?) and a very good cast that also includes Margaret Colin and Boyd Gaines do their best to bring flesh to what remains essentially an annotated outline.

This fact should not dissuade patient theatergoers who want to relish Jefferson Mays in one of those performances that people will be talking about all season...composer-lyricist Steven Lutvak and author-lyricist Robert L. Freedman deliver saucy impudence of bright operetta pastiche...inkham's Monty seems awfully dull in early flashbacks, but gets more dashing as the character gets sure of himself.

Bloom conveys a slightly older hipster (which gives the romance a provocative, asymmetrical twist), while embracing Romeo's foppish, self-loving side. We don't get many revivals of the classic on professional stages, so it's safe to say that Bloom's swaggering, matinee-idol Romeo will be the most engaging you'll see in years.

Think it?€?s just a cheap retro goof? Rock of Ages shatters irony with a killer drum solo, then melts the wreckage with a smoking guitar riff.",Time Out New York,David Cote,4/16/2009
2,The Mystery of Edwin Drood,8,Theater Review: 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood',"""The Mystery of Edwin Drood,"" inspired by an unfinished Charles Dickens novel, is one of the most inventive, inspired and rousing musicals ever devised. And it is a pleasure to report that the Roundabout Theatre Company's revival is thoroughly well-cast and extremely enjoyable?€?As atmospherically staged by Scott Ellis, with sprightly choreography by Warren Carlyle and excellent music direction by Paul Gemignani, this production is a reminder that well-known musicals do not need to be reconstructed or darkened for their revivals. If the show is strong, have faith in it and all will fall into place.",amNY,Matt Windman,11/13/2012
1,Disgraced,6,?€?Disgraced?€?: Theater review,"""Disgraced"" debuts on Broadway aglow with a Pulitzer Prize and awash in the same pros and cons of its 2012 Off-Broadway run. On the plus side, the play is lean and timely...On the downside, conveniences stack up. And Akhtar relies on the hoariest devices around...Even with flaws, ""Disgraced"" is observant and smart. Kimberly Senior, who directed the world premiere at Lincoln Center, guides a good-looking and handsomely acted production...Like sports cars, the actors hugs their characters' curves. Dhillon, who played his role in London, nails Amir's glossy arrogance and sense of loss. Emily is sympathetic, as played by a low-key and quiet Mol, while Radnor is convincing and natural. Pittman, an Off-Broadway holdover, again delivers a precise turn as pointed as Jory's sexy stilettos. Blunted by contrivances, the impact of ""Disgraced"" isn't as sharp -- or as potentially dangerous -- as it could be.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,10/23/2014
2,The Winslow Boy,9,Review: Masterful Rees Heads THE WINSLOW BOY,"Director Lindsay Posner's swift and riveting production comes to Broadway from London's Old Vic. The entirely recast Roundabout staging revolves around a masterful performance by Roger Rees as ailing family patriarch Andrew Winslow. It's a study in subtle details as he valiantly keeps a brave and noble face during the two years the story covers as his health deteriorates, his judgment is questioned and everything he's worked for seems to be crumbling at the latter stages of his life...Though the play never leaves the Winslow drawing room, Rattigan did a remarkable job of keeping suspense and tensions high throughout the evening with detailed descriptions of what was happening in court. This is The Winslow Boy's first Broadway revival since initially visiting in 1947 and Posner's crackling production makes you wonder what took so long.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,10/17/2013
2,Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill,8,Stepping Into the Shoes of a Ravaged Singer,"We hear much (too much) of this sorry story during the show, written by Lanie Robertson and directed by Lonny Price, and first produced Off Broadway in 1986...Mr. Robertson has created a persuasive voice for these reflections, salty and sassy, occasionally flaring into hot bursts of anger, and prone to gin-fueled digressions. Ms. McDonald moves between the moods with a jittery sharpness, conveying the warmth and humor in bright, glowing bursts that can quickly subside into dark, bitter ruminations on the wayward, reckless groove into which her life gradually fell...Still, it's worth putting up with the show's tackier (and duller) aspects for the pleasure of hearing Ms. McDonald breathe aching life into some of Holiday's greatest songs.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,4/13/2014
1,Of Mice and Men,9,"Review: Franco, O'Dowd Are ""Men"" for All Seasons","Celebrated director Anna D. Shapiro pulls no punches in her savage take on ""Of Mice and Men""...It certainly helps that she has two gifted performers as her leading men, James Franco and Chris O'Dowd, both making memorable debuts...It's O'Dowd (the doughy Irish actor and comic, of ""Bridesmaids""), as Lennie, who has the hardest job...His Lennie is a human being of emotional intelligence, whose overwhelming feelings often get the better of him. O'Dowd gives an endearing interpretation of a mentally addled man who wants nothing more than ""to live off the fat of the land."" Franco, the performer-director-writer-teacher -- geez, he's such a multitasker that he even appears in a Gucci ad on the back of the Playbill -- is such a cult object that I feared his presence would throw the characters out of equilibrium. My fears were unwarranted, because he gives such an understated and natural performance.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,4/16/2014
2,Hadestown,9,?€?Hadestown?€? review: This devilish new musical looks poised for Tonys victory,"Still, if this is your first visit to ""Hadestown,"" it's likely to be a satisfying one. Mitchell and director Rachel Chavkin (""Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812"") do an impressive job updating an oft-recounted myth; in this telling, Orpheus (Reeve Carney) falls in love with Eurydice (Eva Noblezada), who in turn flees to Hadestown after its ruler Hades (Patrick Page, whose basso profundo is the stuff of nightmares and/or action movie trailers) promises to end her hunger. The actors are all excellent, with one standing slightly above the rest: In the role of Hades' queen Persephone, the extraordinary Amber Grey (who originated the role off Broadway) gives us a kind of Hellenistic Age Real Housewife, both garishly funny and romantically yearning.",NJ.com,Christopher Kelly,4/17/2019
2,Side Show,8,Broadway Review: ?€?Side Show?€? Directed by Bill Condon,"The new, improved ""Side Show"" smells like a hit. Helmer Bill Condon's shrewd reworking of this short-lived 1997 cult musical by Henry Krieger and Bill Russell...is both darker in tone and lighter in theme than memory has it. Leading ladies Emily Padgett and Erin Davie are perfection as Daisy and Violet Hilton, conjoined twins in real life who were plucked out of a carnival midway by a rascal showman and transformed into vaudeville stars. A lot of things that didn't work in the original version still don't work now, but no question about it, this show has the best freaks on Broadway.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,11/17/2014
0,The House of Blue Leaves,5,Cromer's 'House of Blue Leaves' on Broadway has the darkness but needs the light,"It sometimes feels like Cromer and his fine actors are searching for a core that the play already has considered and dismissed....of the three central characters, only Falco doesn't have this problem, partly because she plays the darkest and most passive character, but also because a soft vulnerability constantly lurks around the eyes of this remarkable actress; America has yet to scratch the surface of what she can do.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,4/25/2011

It may in fact suit and flatter her too well; sometimes one would like to see Lavin clawing her way out of a role instead of slipping so smoothly into it. Here, she wears Anna as fetchingly as Anna wears the perfectly cut Burberry trench coat she imbues with talismanic powers of mysterious romance. It is just such a romance that forms the central (and really the only) plot of this entertaining but threadbare play...If I had to guess, I'd say that Greenberg got trapped (much as Anna does) by what must have felt like a daring idea.",Vulture,Jesse Green,1/20/2016

They are staunchly abetted by Basil Twist?€?s polymorphously perverse puppets and Natasha Katz?€?s cheeky lighting.

That approach has sometimes been a distraction in the past. Not with ""The Father,"" which is really one long mad scene. Langella's larger-than-life performance becomes the character's way of trying to hang on to life...Zeller has underwritten the supporting characters, and director John Hughes is wise to keep those performances very understated. Especially fine are Kathleen McNenny as the woman and Charles Borland as the man.

0,The Parisian Woman,4,The Parisian Woman,"One potentially salutary effect of the 2016 presidential election, people on the left have been nervously saying, is that it might encourage a rebirth of oppositional political art. Beau Willimon's The Parisian Woman picks up that challenge and fumbles it. Loosely adapted from a 19th-century French play by Henry Becque, the play has been rewritten since its 2013 California premiere to specifically target the current administration, though Trump's name is not mentioned aloud until the last five minutes. Yet Willimon-who mapped the political sphere succesfully in Farragut North and Netflix's House of Cards-seems stymied by his project. A political thriller stuffed into a sex comedy's dress, the play bulges in all the wrong places.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,11/30/2017

At one point, her Holiday heads for the bottles of booze lined up in back of them and pours herself a strong one; at another, she nuzzles her pet pooch, Pepi (played by a sweetly poised rescue dog named Roxie)...Not surprisingly, though, Lady Day is at its most potent when the songs speak for her.

Ivo van Hove's magnificent reconception ofArthur Miller's ""A View From the Bridge,"" which opened on Thursday night at the Lyceum Theater, takes you into extreme emotional territory that you seldom dare visit in daily life. At the end of its uninterrupted two hours, you are wrung out, scooped out and so exhausted that you're wide awake.

In concert with Andrew Garfield?€?s embittered Biff, the drifting elder son of the defeat-racked Loman household, Hoffman finds a revealing new way into the psyche of a character Arthur Miller introduced 63 years ago as the damaged end-product of a system that leaves workers to sweep up after the ashes of their dashed hopes.",Washington Post,Peter Marks,3/15/2012

Cox provides a galvanizing center that keeps you watching, even more so as this driven, passionately civic-minded man begins to acknowledge the fatal flaws in his decision-making.

Like a Page 1 headline, he announces himself as a powerhouse talent. Whenever he and the other newsies are on stage, the show flies.

But even the most stalwart cynics may have trouble staying dry-eyed during this portrait of heroic hospitality under extraordinary pressure...this Canadian-born production, written by Irene Sankoff and David Hein and directed by Christopher Ashley, is as honorable in its intentions as it is forthright in its sentimentality. And it may provide just the catharsis you need in an American moment notorious for dishonorable and divisive behavior...the show - based on interviews with the people who inspired it - covers a vast expanse of sensitive material with a respect for its complexity. It understands that much of what it portrays is guaranteed to stir fraught memories among many of us. And it mostly refrains from overegging what could have been a treacly, tear-salted pudding.

The Llewelyn Davies boys...have charm to spare...To gussy up the proceedings, Graham, Barlow, Kennedy and director Diane Paulus, relying on her Pippin-like circus instincts, turn to all sorts of diversions. One of the fussiest is Frohman's acting troupe. They behave like something from Charles Dickens but diluted and cheapened in the transition...Since this is a musical, the score is the biggest disappointment...Off-rhymes have become increasingly acceptable in Top 40 realms, but only come across as lazy in a period piece such as Finding Neverland...They can organize '90s power ballads but not imbue them with anything that clings to the memory once the last full notes fade.",Huffington Post,David Finkle,4/15/2015

You have to go back to The Lion King to find a show with as much invention, spirit and genre-redefining verve.

2,Noises Off,9,Broadway Review: ?€?Noises Off?€?,"Funny lady Andrea Martin leads the nimble cast of this well-tooled revival helmed by Jeremy Herrin, who kept his comedic sensibilities under wraps in last season's austere RSC production of ""Wolf Hall,"" but cuts loose here...Act II is bust-a-gut funny...This is where helmer Herrin puts his well-drilled ensemble through the synchronized chaos that can come crashing down on their heads if someone misses a beat...Like ""Law & Order"" reruns, ""Noises Off"" seems to be always playing somewhere in the civilized world, a perfect specimen of its generic art form. And that's exactly the way it should be, because this kind of comedic brilliance never gets stale.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,1/14/2016
1,Newsies,7,Theater Review: 'Newsies',"Jeff Calhoun's excellent production benefits from a three-story set design of scaffolds, complimented by cinematic projections, and Christopher Gattelli's spectacular choreography. The absolutely incredible young males in the cast do back-flips and audacious balletic spins, tap-dance on bar tables and shuffle with sheets of newspaper under their feet. Jordan, who starred in the flop ""Bonnie and Clyde"" earlier this season, proves himself yet again to be a genuine matinee idol as Jack. His theatrical performance bursts with an aggressive fighting spirit and sincere adolescent emotion.",amNY,Matt Windman,3/29/2012
2,War Horse,10,War Horse,"Ultimately, however, the show belongs to Seth Numrich as Albert. The Juilliard-trained actor, whom I first admired Off-Broadway in 2009's ""Slipping,"" is the heart and soul of ""War Horse."" His vivid performance is rigorously honest, with a breathtaking emotional transparency. Commanding the stage like a seasoned vet, Numrich effortlessly provides the considerable size that this production requires.

1,Allegiance,7,'Allegiance' review: George Takei on WWII Japanese-American camps,"The show isn't bombastic or preachy, though some may find the well-structured book -- written by Marc Acito, Jay Kuo and Lorenzo Thione -- too earnest. Kuo's serviceable score is loaded with anthems, simple melodic lines and some obvious rhymes, with a few lighthearted '40s boogie-woogy numbers to signify Americana. Although we hear enticing Japanese flute and percussion between scenes, this more ""Le Miz""-lite pop opera than a fusion of musical cultures.",Newsday,Linda Winer,11/8/2015

0,Let It Be,4,Beatles Music Back on Broadway Despite Lawsuit: Stage,"The title ""Let It Be"" suggests a departure from the formulaic Beatles tribute. Maybe a drama about the recording of the final album that the band released and the tensions that drove the four apart? No such luck. The show at the St. James Theatre breaks no new ground...The show proceeds chronologically from the early innocent rock influenced by Chuck Berry and others to the more experimental songs that changed pop music. The patter is kept to a minimum and these Fab Four get along from beginning to end. Although the musicianship is proficient and vocal range is impressive, seldom does the show rise above what London critic Michael Billington called ""faintly necrophiliac nostalgia.""",Bloomberg,Philip Boroff,7/24/2013
2,The King and I,9,'The King and I' reigns on Broadway with Kelli O'Hara and Ken Watanabe,"Sher's vision subtly augments tradition, with lifelike details of the new world in which Anna Leonowens finds herself...As Anna, O'Hara is a terrific fit, with an exquisite, melting soprano as well as dignity and quick wit. Ken Watanabe...is a captivating actor, blazing-eyed and sharp as he portrays the virile character's single-mindedness, playful side and the childlike temper of one who has never been contradicted...Watanabe's diction could occasionally be clearer, his singing more confident and his bearing imbued with more gravity. For her part, although O'Hara builds a rich, likeable character, she does not sound quite as vocally lush as she did last season in ""The Bridges of Madison County."" Still, as they find their ideals in conflict, they make worthy adversaries, and also find real chemistry. Watanabe and O'Hara enchantingly convey the sparks of intelligence and will that bring their characters together...This remains a production in which all aspects have been satisfyingly thought out, and a work that stands the test of time.",Star-Ledger,Ronni Reich,4/16/2015

Million Dollar Quartet, a show poised delicately at the halfway point between a musical and a revue, distills that revolutionary spirit and splashes it out as a dazzling, raucous spectacle.",New York,Stephanie Zacharek,4/11/2010

Review: Quiet Tragicomedies of Love and Loss,"Directed by Carrie Cracknell, ""Sea Wall/A Life"" - a hit downtown early this year, at the Public Theater - is the most stripped-down storytelling on Broadway right now. The quiet spectacle these plays offer is in the acting of tragicomedies of love and loss, young men's stories about fatherhood and family, and about the hole that grief can blast right through a person's center.",New York Times,Laura Collins-Hughes,8/8/2019

There are tangential scenes set in Saigon, backstage at the Pulitzer Prizes, and a lengthy subplot involving journalist David Halberstam (Stephen Kunken) ?€? the muckraking, Jewish counterpoint to Alsop's increasingly obsolescent country-club socialite. Still, it's a testament to Lithgow's magnetism that the scenes without him seem like rude interruptions from the main event.",Entertainment Weekly,Keith Staskiewicz,4/25/2012
0,Doctor Zhivago,5,'Doctor Zhivago': Russian love is frozen over on Broadway,"Rare indeed are the musicals that begin, in essence, with three consecutive memorial services...but it is emblematic of the problems that beset this new Broadway musical...that love story is lost in a melange of flame, ice, death and frantic characters rushing around a heavily raked stage without ever seeming really to know where they are going...Nolan has an extraordinary singing voice, and Mutu certainly is no slouch in the vocal department, but he's a tad stiff and unyielding. There is a certain poignancy and truth in McAnuff's staging of a marriage rooted in warm affection but not the life force of sexual passion. And a few of Simon's songs are quite beautiful, although they all seem squelched by the conceptual whole, unable to break free. ""Doctor Zhivago"" is one of those shows that needed to cut through the icy clutter and find the optimism of love and the sacrifices it spawns. Alas, the poetic leanings of the title character are never fully explored.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,4/21/2015

Charms as Show Turns Into Pumpkin: Review,"You can see light beaming from Laura Osnes at the Broadway Theatre, where she's playing the Cinderella of any girl's fantasy....Osnes has doe-eyed charm, a lovely soprano and whatever it is that separates a star from the chorus without trumpeting the fact. And in this first-ever Broadway production of ""Rodgers + Hammerstein's Cinderella"" she shimmers -- even when just about everything around her is flying off the rails.",Bloomberg,Jeremy Gerard,3/3/2013
2,Love Letters,8,The Muted Melancholy Between the Lines,"I had a suspicion that Mr. Gurney's play, first seen in New York in 1989 and trotted out regularly since then at regional and amateur theaters the world over, might by now feel as dated as the means by which its characters trade their thoughts. I also thought I detected a little cynicism in bringing what is essentially a staged reading to Broadway, sprucing it up with big names, and charging roughly $140 for a top-price ticket. But before long, my qualms began to erode under the sweet, sad spell of Mr. Gurney's deceptively simple and quietly moving play. As performed by a sterling Mr. Dennehy, playing the rock-solid, letter-loving Andrew Makepeace Ladd III, and an utterly extraordinary Ms. Farrow, as the flighty, unstable and writing-averse Melissa Gardner, Mr. Gurney's intimate drama gains steadily in power, as life keeps ripping away at the seams of its characters' well-tailored existences. The play's means may be economical, but it etches a deep portrait of life's painful vicissitudes.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,9/18/2014
2,The Color Purple,9,Slimmed-Down 'Color Purple' Revival Pushes the Right Buttons,"The limited staging (a major difference from the original Broadway production a decade ago) puts the focus on the score, by Brenda Russell, Allee Willis and Stephen Bray...A trio of supremely talented women all making their Broadway debuts do most of the singing. Cynthia Erivo is outstanding as Celie...Hudson gives us a steamy and satisfying Shug...The ""Dreamgirls"" Oscar winner gets out of the way of the story and the other actors, in what is truly a supporting performance...Brooks...and Kyle Scatliffe, as on-again, off-again lovers Sofia and Harpo, deliver particularly strong performances. Their second act duet, ""Any Little Thing,"" is a grinding, groovy delight...This production, as buoyant and vital as can be, premiered at London's Menier Chocolate Factory in 2013...Broadway's latest incarnation focuses almost entirely on song, but it's still the same joyous and uplifting journey.",NBC New York,Robert Kahn,12/10/2015
2,Meteor Shower,8,Review: Look Up!

0,Gigi,6,Gigi,"...Eric Schaeffer's revival, starring High School Musical's Vanessa Hudgens as the titular girl, rescues the show from the dustbin of history and moves it to a recycling bin of the present. Revised by Heidi Thomas to accommodate modern sensibilities, this Gigi is inoffensive to a fault. The heroine remains a courtesan-in-training, but she's been given more spunk...Gigi is the story of a girl being groomed to sell herself, and when the musical dances around that -- however attractively, thanks to Joshua Bergasse's swift choreography -- it feels evasive. More often, though, it merely feels generic. Hudgens's Gigi seems lovely but simple, her gee-whiz appeal hobbled by affected enunciation...Only Cott, especially in his big solo, seems committed to the reality of the story. The rest is mostly yesterday's bubbly, domestic and served lukewarm.",TimeOut NY,Adam Feldman,4/8/2015

2,The Encounter,10,Broadway Review: Complicite?€?s ?€?The Encounter?€?,"It's a story told with vivid precision, both linguistic and theatrical. McBurney flies over the Amazon with a bamboo stick for a plane. He takes us right into the rainforest, looping his own animal whoops and insectoid croaks as he circles the stage, rustling plastic for leaves underfoot. The head-mic becomes the shamanic headman. It's a deeply immersive experience, completely transporting. You seem to fall out of time with McIntyre and McBurney, rapt by this gripping thriller.",Variety,Matt Trueman,9/29/2016
1,Kinky Boots,8,'Kinky Boots': Theater review,"Porter (""Dreamgirls"") is a force of nature as Lola. Sands (""American Idiot""), in the tamer role, makes Charlie wonderfully appealing.

1,Sunset Boulevard,7,?€?Sunset Boulevard?€? Review: The Picture Got Small,"Not so Ms. Close. To be sure, she is 69, much older than the 50-year-old character whom she plays, but that doesn't matter in the least. If anything, her greater age makes Norma's plight all the more pitiable, and Ms. Close's performance, by turns adamantine and childishly needy, is as memorable in its own way as was that of Gloria Swanson in the movie. No, the fundamental problem with turning ""Sunset Boulevard"" into a musical is that it is perfect, a fact that is well understood by Don Black and Christopher Hampton, whose book is largely faithful to the Wilder-Charles Brackett script, give or take a sprinkling of superfluous four-letter words (though their lyrics are sing-songy and ill-crafted). The truth is that ""Sunset Boulevard"" doesn't need songs, or anything else that it doesn't already have in abundance. Saving Ms. Close's presence, to change anything at all is necessarily to diminish the film's overwhelming effect.",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,2/9/2017
1,The Father,8,The Father review ?€? Frank Langella devastates in study of dementia,"Parts of the play can feel somewhat too pat, as though Zeller is amusing himself in finding out how many ways he can alter reality using the familiar mechanisms of the stage - an audience's trust of exposition, the faith in representational setting, the tendency to identify a particular character with a single actor. But he dismisses most of this cleverness in an ending that is both sentimental and searing and will probably devastate anyone who has seen a close friend or relative suffer from dementia. The final scene is a terrible and tragic reversion, in which a man of articulacy and power is reduced to a kind of infantilism, left with with no language but a cry.",Guardian,Alexis Soloski,4/14/2016

1,The House of Blue Leaves,4,The House of Blue Leaves,"In his revelatory production of Thornton Wilder?€?s Our Town, director David Cromer unearthed the darkness underlying a play that is usually presented as a paean to a more innocent America. He applies the same approach to the new Broadway revival of John Guare?€?s 1966 absurdist comedy The House of Blue Leaves, but with vastly diminished results. The production captures the desperation and pathos of the play?€?s troubled characters, but at the cost of the play?€?s humor.",ScheckOnTheater,Frank Scheck,4/26/2011

Though Williams does mandate things such as the offstage singing of field hands, Ashford ham-fistedly employs Adam Cork's busy sound design, especially in the too-obvious use of some punctuating fireworks. Ashford also begins and ends each act with Cork's crashing music cranked up high, as if to create by fiat the searing drama that he has been unable to unlock in the play. Williams should be allowed to make his own music.",Backstage,Erik Haagensen,1/17/2013
1,Choir Boy,8,BWW Review: Tarell Alvin McCraney's Coming-Of-Age Drama CHOIR BOY Sings Out Spiritual Nourishment,"While the play takes place in contemporary times, McCraney and director Trip Cullman's warmly affectionate tone gives it the kind of nostalgic feel that's familiar to the genre. And the issues that arise in the piece do have a touch of familiarity. What isn't familiar, though, is placing a young gay man of color - one who feels he has nothing to hide - at the center of it all, considerably raising the significance of placing a play like Choir Boy in front of Broadway audiences.",BroadwayWorld,Michael Dale,1/8/2019
0,The River,6,Broadway Review: ?€?The River?€? Starring Hugh Jackman,"The lighting (by UK designer Charles Balfour) is subtly seductive, and the ever-inventive sound maven Ian Dickinson (of the Autograph design team), who also did the fancy work on ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"" and ""Jerusalem,"" has invented a symphony of provocative night sounds that sustains the mood of the play from beginning to end, even when the human voices start to grate on the ear. Things start to go south when the Woman opens her mouth to reveal a shallow, rather silly character who gains no stature from Jumbo's perky performance. And while Jackman puts heart and soul into Butterworth's mystical meditations on the spiritual properties of trout fishing (even as he efficiently guts and cooks a very real fish on stage), fishing is still fishing and after a while you feel the urge to throw these fishy speeches back into the water.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,11/16/2014
2,Jersey Boys,7,Raucous in Secaucus,"Not to take anything away from the actual, you know, band, but the show's charm is primarily Des McAnuff's doing. The director has no illusions about what drives this sort of show. Jersey Boys may aim only to be a shallow, big-budget, crowd-pleasing jukebox musical, but it's a model of the genre. Admire first the deftness of the storytelling by librettists Marshall Brickman (who co-wrote Annie Hall) and Rick Elice. From the hardscrabble early scenes, which mostly involve band members- rotating in and out of jail ('the Rahway Academy of the Arts,' as the scholar-in-residence DeVito puts it), the script uses a Scorsese trick to race the action along: The boys' narration propels the story by layering exposition right over the songs. Sugar and medicine are calibrated so finely that, almost before you realize it, the boys have traded their horrible clashing pink shirts for the true badge of early-sixties pop success, matching maroon blazers. Buongiorno, groupies.",New York Magazine,Jeremy McCarter,11/21/2005
2,A Raisin in the Sun,10,?€?A Raisin in the Sun?€?: Theater review,"Denzel Washington's popularity makes the revival of ""A Raisin in the Sun"" a hot ticket, but there's a better reason: He and the show are flat-out excellent. Reprising Sidney Poitier's role, Washington is stunning as the dreamer-schemer Walter Lee Younger, whose frustration throbs at the heart of an American classic that is as deeply humorous as it is affecting. The Oscar and Tony winner squeezes this juicy role with all his might, yet also melds seamlessly with his fellow actors...Guided by director Kenny Leon, performances are natural and lived-in, giving the audience the feeling that they're overhearing private conversations. But listening -- and really heeding -- is the point.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,4/3/2014
2,Fish in the Dark,7,Theater Review: ?€?Fish in the Dark?€?,"David's play exploits human foibles - those silly, petty, mindless things that we think and do, like trying to find some real wood to knock on. In David's world, everything is a setup for his characters' self-centered behavior. With the stellar cast directed by Anna D. Shapiro, the payoffs are genuinely hysterical...He generously surrounds himself with masters of comic timing; Jayne Houdyshell, Lewis J. Stadlen, Rosie Perez, Rita Wilson, MaryLouise Burke and Ben Shenkman among them.

2,The Performers,6,Theater Review: 'The Performers',"While ""The Performers"" is hardly an ambitious play and the characters tend to be either rigidly stupid or uptight, it is undoubtedly a crowd-pleasing show, combining raunchy humor with a simple setup and conservative emphasis on monogamy. As skillfully directed by Evan Cabnet, the likable and very attractive cast indulges in all the silliness without going too overboard. Of course, the real standouts are Graynor and Jackson for going to such ridiculous, childish and idiotic extremes. Winkler, whose character is three decades older than everyone else, appears to be having a good time. Silverstone, looking rather like a sad puppy, is effectively cute and pairs nicely with Breaker.",amNY,Matt Windman,11/14/2012

""It's an old song,"" sings our narrator, the messenger god Hermes (Andr?? De Shields, a master of arch razzle-dazzle). ""And we're gonna sing it again.""

Floating up there most buoyantly is the impression of Lane's priceless turn as Walter Burns - an editor so voraciously news hungry he could survive purely on a diet of scoops. In boxy pin-striped suit and bushy black mustache, Lane hurls Burns's blunt-force insults and bolts of impotent rage in all directions, with the timing and ??lan that have made him one of the great comic actors of our age. Slattery, playing the roguish Hildy Johnson, Burns's restive star reporter at the Chicago Examiner, reveals again the gift for the kind of swaggering masculinity he displayed as Roger Sterling on ""Mad Men.""

Nevertheless, many a good musical has been born out of apparently unpromising material. Now that I've experienced ""Hands on a Hardbody""...I still haven't seen it. The tuner coarsens its self-effacing, quietly observant source with cheesy soap-opera backstories, forced Lifetime-movie subplotting, and self-righteous hot-button-issue pressing in an obviously manipulative attempt to stir our emotions.

Hence the coach, a boorish, ill-educated stage-Irish blowhard who proudly displays pictures of Teddy Roosevelt, John Kennedy and Fightin' Joe McCarthy on his mantelpiece and salts his small talk with good old-fashioned ethnic slurs of the highest possible voltage, thereby alerting the audience to his lack of enlightenment.

Victoria Clark is her trusty self as the crusty Mother Superior who butts wimples with Deloris, but the show's only real color is provided in smaller comic roles, such as Demond Green's dim-witted thug and Audrie Neenan's rigid sister.

1,The Front Page,7,Nathan Lane?€?s The News In Scott Rudin?€?s Star-Packed ?€?Front Page?€? Revival,"With his jauntily angled fedora and suit jacket slung over his shoulder, Slattery comes across as more of a Rat Pack swinger than a flapper-following flirt just before the Jazz Age was snuffed out by Black Monday. But it suits him and he's an instant bright spot among the malcontents who've been forced into a long night awaiting the 7 AM hanging of Earl Williams, an illiterate white man who has been convicted of killing a black cop. Hildy's plans inspire caustic merriment among his pals, who insist it won't be long until he ""has seven kids, a mortgage and belongs to a country club."" There's also much ribbing of New York newspapers, especially the New York Times (""might as well work for a bank,"" one says), inside jokes from two authors who knew newspapers, Chicago and its Second City neuroses better than anyone.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,10/20/2016
2,King Lear,9,Glenda Jackson roars in an amazing 'King Lear?€? on Broadway: review,"She looks like no King Lear you've ever seen before - a small, thin woman in a black suit, her silver pageboy combed neatly to the side. Yet when the legendary British actress Glenda Jackson begins to speak - and then to fulminate and rage as only the narcissistic, aggrieved Lear can - she mows down men three times her size. The contrast is thrilling, and a key to the success of Sam Gold's smashing new production of the Shakespeare chestnut, now playing at the Cort Theatre on Broadway. This is a ""King Lear"" that wholly captures the complexities and contradictions of its title character, a still-roaring lion who refuses to accept that winter has dawned.",NJ.com,Christopher Kelly,4/4/2019

There is no reason to close your eyes, but you could, and the actors' beautiful enunciation and encapsulation of Williams's words would be as pleasurable as the best radio play...When characters are not in scenes directly they observe them or sit a little away from them. The psychologically astute implication is that they are present in spirit, or will be affected by whatever is unfolding. This is Williams as seen at his most pared-back.

In certain wonderful ways -- Susan Stroman's happy-tappy dance rhythms, the dazzling design work on everything from proscenium curtain to wigs, and a fabulous chorus line of dancing dolls, molls and gangsters -- Woody Allen's showbiz musical is the answer to a Broadway tinhorn's prayer. Surprisingly, though, the book (from Allen's own screenplay for his 1994 film) is feeble on laughs, and certain key performers don't seem comfortable navigating the earthy comic idiom of burlesque.

Daniels' portrayal seems more urgently embodied than before...the most dangerous aspect of the work...is the playwright's refusal to moralize...Daniels makes every moment of this faceoff vibratingly real. Even when practically bouncing off the walls in anxiety and resentment, he remains grounded in his character...Williams is more stylized in her delivery, but there's no doubt that she is fully experiencing her character's anguish. Her performance calls attention to itself, but never in a gratuitous way.",LA Times,Charles McNulty,3/10/2016

It's nevertheless an enjoyable venture, with the sumptuousness of director John Dove's production helping to mask the flaws. The elegant visuals by designer Jonathan Fensom and costume coordinator Lorraine Ebdon-Price (accented by hair and wigs by Campbell Young Associates), are illuminated by lighting designer Paul Russell with candles placed at footlights and hanging from chandeliers.

Consider the trajectory of the most sympathetic character, a police officer named Victor Franz, as played in this Roundabout Theatre production by Mark Ruffalo, an actor who specializes in low-status characters with natural affinities for sadness and for whom snapping out of something is pretty much an impossibility.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,3/16/2017

(While one woman-Betty Comden-is credited on the title page, there isn't a word of hers in evidence.) In such a venture, some material is likely to be included for reasons other than suitability.

In theory, it's a fascinating experiment-especially for theatergoers who have the resources to see both versions of the show, as I was able to.

The helpers of Come From Away were not in a position to risk their lives on that tragic day, but they were given the opportunity to open their hearts and, as dramatized on the Schoenfeld stage, they gloriously did so....As a theatre critic, I'm often asked by people I meet for recommendations. Before answering, I always ask what kind of plays or musicals they usually like, so I can match them up with something they'd more likely enjoy.

His songs seamlessly propel plot and define character in the way numbers did in the heyday of Rodgers and Hammerstein. But he often inflects them with the ring-a-ding swell and swing you associate with Frank Sinatra recordings from the late 1950s and early '60s. He's not just quoting or sending up that style; he's embracing it on his own terms as a keen-eared fan of today.

In ?€?Nice Work,?€? even given a stellar cast, when she?€?s on the stage she often is the single focus, by sheer force of her ability to sing any song fully in character, and deliver it with a striking musicality. This leaves her leading man, Matthew Broderick, in an uncomfortable position. Although his part of a rich playboy with a low-wattage brain means he must appear as a constant shade of gray among the colorful characters on stage, a part he delivers earnestly, his singing seems only serviceable by comparison to O?€?Hara?€?s.",Philadelphia Inquirer,Howard Shapiro,4/24/2012
2,The Color Purple,8,?€?The Color Purple?€? review: Showstopper stuns on Broadway,"Genuine showstoppers rarely happen in the musical theater, especially in the middle of an act. But when they do, something happens -- maybe to the air pressure in the lungs of theatergoers -- which seems to buoy whole groups of disparate audiences to their feet. It happened at a recent preview of ""The Color Purple"" and, chances are, it's happening every night. Edging toward the finale of the show, Cynthia Erivo, a British actress in her thrilling Broadway debut, lays into a song...full of defiant realization for her character Celie after a lifetime of insult, drudgery and self-sacrifice...Director John Doyle's passionate, scaled-down, streamlined, low-frills revival of the 2005 musical adaptation of Alice Walker's 1982 Pulitzer-winning novel is not priming us for big musical-theater gestures.

McNally, 75, who got married in 2010, writes here with the moral authority of one who has chronicled this fast-moving history in real, dramatic time; had ""Mothers and Sons"" been the work of a different playwright, the way it feels in the theater would be entirely different. The persona of the writer counts for a great deal here, aesthetically, politically and otherwise. Broadway doesn't often feel like a community talking to itself about the immediate moment, but it does here. This is also an exceptionally timely play, a piece that puts great change into context and, in the Broadway world, also has the advantage of having gotten there before anyone else; same-sex marriage became legal in New York only in summer 2011.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,3/24/2014

One yearns for the over-coiffed McGregor to loosen up: the likeable Scotsman seems a tad stolid playing the so-called ""Henry of Mayfair"", a role to which his lanky, rangy predecessors were suited down to the last hyper-articulate quip. Gyllenhaal has her moments, especially near the start, but she doesn't come naturally by the effortless sensuality needed to play a grown-up minx.

Not that Doctor Zhivago, slickly directed by Des McAnuff, is especially mega...The music is big and the cast is big and the emotions are definitely outsized...And yet the impact is oddly minimal. Maybe it's the undistinguished book or Lara's ridiculous wig or those silly icicles, but Doctor Zhivago seems a lot more overblown than overpowering. The style is pure melodrama, but most of the actors don't have the stanchness or the lines to pull it off...Which is a shame, as many of the songs are skillful...many of them communicate tone and character eloquently...Kelli Barrett has a lovely voice, but can't sell Lara as the cynosure of every man's desire...And if Tam Mutu doesn't seem the poetry-writing type, he has a pleasantly romantic baritone and very handsome looks.",Guardian,Alexis Soloski,4/21/2015

Strutting gut-first and affecting a gruff Southern drawl, the leading man delivers the emphatic, crowd-pleasing performance that the play, and Bill Rauch's vigorous direction, require, while also making Johnson affecting as a flesh-and-blood human being.",USA Today,Elysa Gardner,3/6/2014

True, the second half is almost completely unnecessary, the English accents are laughable and the footwear puns are relentless. But who cares? This is a big ol' sweet love story about sons, the families we make and red patent leather...the real star is Porter, who delivers a touching, sassy, nuanced performance, often in 8-inch heels. One character sums up his importance to this show by saying, ""Whenever you leave a room, there's always a great big gaping gap."" Amen.",Associated Press,Mark Kennedy,4/4/2013
2,Jersey Boys,7,From Blue-Collar Boys to Doo-Wop Sensation: A Band's Rise and Fall,"In a year in which one pop-songbook show after another has thudded and died, ""Jersey Boys,"" a shrink-wrapped musical biography of the pop group the Four Seasons, passes as silver instead of as the chrome-plated jukebox that it is. Unlike the recent Broadway flops, this show has the advantage of featuring singers that actually sound like the singers they are portraying and a technology-enhanced band that approximates the original sound of their music. Scriptwriters Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice provide some likably sassy dialogue as they chart the evolution of their main characters from street kids in the urban wastelands of New Jersey to pop gods enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. But while ""Jersey Boys"" is based on fact, it rarely leaps over the cliches of a regulation grit-to-glamour blueprint.",New York Times,Ben Brantley,11/7/2005

2,The Front Page,10,Broadway review: The Front Page grabs headlines with Nathan Lane and John Slattery,"Look, we're all depressed this election year. We're sick of seeing know-nothing politicians; of hearing obscene language insulting women and minorities; and we're disgusted by the media's bottomless appetite for sensationalism. The only antidote I can suggest for this national malaise is a visit to the Broadhurst Theatre to see the 5,000-volt revival of The Front Page. What's it about? Oh, all that stuff I just mentioned-but whipped into a hellacious comic frenzy by one of the best acting ensembles you and I may ever see. Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's 1928 evisceration of the newspaper racket is a summit of American screwball comedy, and Nathan Lane, John Slattery and two dozen other actors climb it and plant their flag. It's strange to feel so invigorated and refreshed by a spectacle of rampant cynicism in which love, truth and loyalty are systematically demolished. But see this brutally brilliant masterpiece, and you'll be inoculated against the viciousness of the world.",TimeOut NY,David Cote,10/20/2016

0,Motown The Musical,3,Theater Review: Motown: The Musical,"To a roomful of people who have rarely if ever been part of the creation of a major musical, perhaps it seemed sufficient to tie a few dozen presold numbers together with just enough thread to tell a story. (Mamma Mia! has so far grossed more than $534 million on Broadway doing just that.) But the problem with jukeboxes has never been the songs. The problem is that when songs are forced to tell a tale they weren't designed for, they lose their deeper effectiveness, and usually end up like leeches, no longer supporting but sucking. In that respect, Motown is the worst jukebox (with the best tunes) I've ever encountered.",Vulture,Jesse Green,4/14/2013
2,Act One,8,You?€?ve Got to Have Hart,"The result is a thrillingly well-staged play that runs for two hours and 40 minutes but feels much shorter. Not only is ""Act One"" light on its theatrical feet, but it has the open-hearted impact of a melodrama -- one that has the advantage of being true. Part of what makes ""Act One"" so potent is that Mr. Lapine disdains all irony in describing Mr. Hart's rise to fame. His was an old-fashioned American-dream-come-true tale, and it doesn't embarrass Mr. Lapine in the least to dish it up on a pageantlike scale reminiscent of the spectacular stage version of ""Nicholas Nickleby.""",Wall Street Journal,Terry Teachout,4/17/2014

With its music, its dance, its flurry of likable leads, and snowball after snowball of son and lumi??re, some of it newfangled, some of it stretching back to 19th-century melodrama, it offers most of the pleasures that we count on Broadway musicals to provide. But even with the addition of a dozen new songs by the composers Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, an enhanced book by Jennifer Lee, and the interventions of director Michael Grandage and scenic and costume designer Christopher Oram, it rarely feels like more than the movie and sometimes it feels like less.",The Guardian,Alexis Soloski,3/22/2018

Yet ""Matilda"" turns out to be an explosion of joy, the most exhilarating and flat-out best musical since ""Billy Elliot.""...""Matilda"" comes with a ready-made audience via generations who have feasted upon the original story. But this transcends its source. As with ""Billy Elliot,"" having the narrative led by the title character and numerous other children necessitates expensive multiple casts.

He crafts an adult, intelligent play about Hillary and Bill's private and public trials, but he's far too nice about it. Over the course of 90 minutes, Hill and Bill argue, make up, discuss the campaign, but the end is never in doubt, and there's a curiously defeated quality not only to Hillary's hopes, but to the arc of the drama itself. In the end, Hillary and Clinton is the wistful, Thornton Wilder-tinged mediation on HRC that no one asked for. There are rants, jokes and confessions, but it doesn't add up to much more than clever, lightly postmodern fanfic. (The same was ultimately true of A Doll's House, Part 2.)

Jenna eventually grabs such an opportunity with her comely-but-married gynecologist (played by Drew Gehling), and it is here that the show stutters: Gehling's Dr. Pomatter feels like a sitcom doc rather than a serious love interest for a serious young woman, and thus you don't pull for them as you should. I had the same issue with Nick Cordero's Earl (Jenna's husband), played as a standard-issue man-spreader when the show would be better if you saw deeper into his anger and depression - especially since Bareilles has given him ""You Will Still Be Mine,"" one of the most poignant songs in the show.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,4/24/2016

It would seem perfectly timed to follow FX's juicy Feud, though War Paint is more notable for the distanced sparring of its glambitious animus. Despite the bellicose title, this is no wig-pulling, lipstick-smearing catfight.

She was lucky, too, in having eventually convinced Tom Hanks, who had been reluctant, to star as McAlary...And while it's no little compliment to his performance to say it is as good as that of his castmates, who are excellent from top to bottom, the triumph belongs to Ephron and Wolfe, who are almost one entity here.

(I'd guess that it wants to be a Christian family entertainment with a bold message about the power of redemption.) It is also a confusing cartoon so lacking in craft that it ruins any chance of being taken seriously.

But three-quarters of an hour into the 95-minute show, the script simply circles without deepening, darkening or clarifying...But in ""Realistic Joneses,"" his Broadway debut, the engine remains stuck in second.

His family quandary is also what the plot turns on; its jerry-rigged tension eventually comes to a head in a revelation that feels more schematic than earned, and the stress points of race and sex and power the script touches on are only glancingly resolved. but Lobby is still a smart, thoughtful piece of work, fairy-dusted by the starry presence of its celebrated cast.",Entertainment Weekly,Leah Greenblatt,3/26/2018

2,Jersey Boys,8,Jersey Boys: Welcome to Falsettoland,"Now we have Jersey Boys; an exceedingly fun and electrifyingly staged tale of the rise and fall of The Four Seasons, which smartly uses their hit songs as a sort of background soundtrack to the story of a group of blue-collar guys establishing a distinctive sound during the early years of rock and roll. They sing songs on stages, in clubs, and in recording studios, but, aside from a couple of missteps, never as part of a book scene. And yet director Des McAnuff, by being very stingy with applause breaks until the audience is ready to burst, and bookwriters Marshall Brickman & Rick Elice, by deftly weaving the dialogue in and out of the music, have found a method to use songs to fuel the story without overwhelming it. Fans of The Four Seasons may walk in excited to hear familiar favorites like ""Sherry"", ""Big Girls Don't Cry"", ""Rag Doll"" and ""Walk Like a Man"", but they should leave the theatre impressed with how plot-driven the entire production is without ever short-handing the music.

So Gold is performing a tricky balancing act: narrowing the scope of the representation and maintaining his cutting-edge cred while selling the story to an audience of 1,000. One of the casualties of this approach is what Tom calls ""the social background"" of the play. We lose not just the particular St. Louisness of it (the accents are nearly nil) but also the world-on-edge tension that Tom describes at the start: Guernica exploding in Europe, and, in America, ""the fiery braille alphabet of a dissolving economy."" Instead Gold focuses on a novel and largely convincing interpretation of the family's warfare as a symptom of the powerful but constraining love they share, and on the way both things shape Tom's character deep into the future from which he narrates.",Vulture,Jesse Green,2003/9/17

So immediately stunning is the accuracy of her replication of Holiday's timbre and inflections at that point of her life that many of Thursday night's audience responded with applause a mere eight bars into her opening performance of 'I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone.' So galvanizing is McDonald's work that it wasn't until midway through the performance that I began to notice images being projected in back of her. Never mind them.

But do we really want to dedicate our time to his lengthy, self-centered learning process - especially, in Tootsie, when the hero gets to spend so much of that process enjoying the spotlight?

Moreover, Mitchell and, to her credit, Chavkin have mined a beautiful and theatrically resonant tale from their source material. If there are traces of the pretensions that marred Natasha in this heavily stylized production, the director and her lavishly talented design team remain in service to the story, which ties together the myths of Orpheus and Eurydice, respectively played by Reeve Carney and Eva Noblezada, and Hades and Persephone, played by Patrick Page and Amber Gray.",New York Stage Review,Elysa Gardner,4/17/19

Unyielding in its needling focus, this riveting drama is a stark examination of love, pain and loss that's both compassionate and unforgiving, all of which helps it navigate the move to a bigger stage with a corresponding amplification of its emotional power.",Hollywood Reporter,David Rooney,2003/10/16

It doesn't come from nowhere, of course: In some ways, ""What the Constitution Means to Me"" recalls Lisa Kron's memoir play ""Well,"" in which a prepared speech about urban decline is hijacked by a mother who begs to differ. In other ways, Ms. Schreck's play seems to be part of the wave of formal experimentation being led by young black playwrights today. Linking these works is a sense of backlash and betrayal. But in the wake of tragedy, Ms. Schreck offers something more than catharsis.

It's a brave, if odd, choice for a Broadway debut, this meager work that reads better than it plays...The biggest miscue of Michael Grandage's production (whether the choice is the director's or the star's, it's impossible to know) is that Erie seems to believe his bullshit. He lacks the sense of desperation that O'Neill says will overcome Erie during the course of this dark hour...There is no sense of the growing panic that will lead to Erie's final revelation about his loss of confidence after Hughie's death...The result is a failure to lift this small work into the tragic realm to which it aspires.

That she's graceful and strikes breathtakingly beautiful lines was a given. Which is good because Fairchild plays a key role in this dance-heavy musical -- originally choreographed by Jerome Robbins, now by Joshua Bergasse. But it turns out the elfin ballerina's also a nimble, effortlessly funny comedienne. The show explodes with unfettered joy every time she's onstage. When she's not, it's more complicated...Betty Comden and Adolph Green's book and lyrics still crackle and pop after all these decades, and therein lies the rub: The show's already written funny, so director John Rando's frantic oversell can feel a little desperate.",NY Post,Elisabeth Vincentelli,10/16/14
2,Sister Act,9,Broadway Musical 'Sister Act' Will Convert You,"Calibrated to be frothy, giggly and yet often poignant, the Jerry Zaks-directed musical is based on the 1992 movie of the same name starring Whoopi Goldberg, who is now producing. This is a musical that hits all the right spots, achieving something close to Broadway grace. It helps that the musical has great original tunes by songwriter Alan Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater that skitters from Motown, to soul and funk, to disco and even a little jokey Barry White. Menken and Slater, who also teamed up for ""The Little Mermaid,"" know perfectly how to switch up the mood and tempo.

2,Hand to God,8,"__and to God_ review: Steven Boyer devilishly good in Robert Askins' smart, funny, foul-mouthed comedy","The new Broadway comedy ""Hand to God"" is so ridiculously raunchy, irreverent and funny it's bound to leave you sore from laughing. Ah, hurts so good...As in two earlier downtown runs of the show, Steven Boyer stars as Jason, and his acting and puppeteering are exceptional. Watching him do battle against his own dark side - Tyrone appears to yank him like a rag doll - is as good as physical comedy gets. It can't be outdone - and shouldn't be missed...But Askins, in his Broadway debut, proves deft at writing dialogue that's hysterical and at serving up insights about organized religion and family dysfunction. He's unapologetically profane - prompting a handful of walkouts after a line about body fluids at a recent performance. Their loss. Ultimately, Askins gets to what pain does to people. All the characters - even the cloth one - are up to their eyeballs in agony. Under the direction of Moritz von Stuelpnagel, the production zips by. It's not typical Broadway fare, but all involved deserve a big hand.",NY Daily News,Joe Dziemianowicz,2004/7/15

He is not a preener and, at first, that wig with Vulcan hairline hardly eases him into the elegance of Christopher Hampton's deliciously evil and erotic 1985 adaptation of Choderlos de Laclos' scandalous novel. And yet Schreiber finds another way, an increasingly irresistible way, into a character generally expected to exemplify the exquisite, unrepentant boredom of the pre-Revolution French aristocracy. This Valmont seems more drawn to the mischief of the games he plots with the Marquise that ruin innocent people for sport and revenge. Despite his height and despite the violent moments when rough seductions get cringingly close to what we perceive today as rape, his Valmont is a bit of an imp - bemused, playful, almost touching in his insolent confidence.",Newsday,Linda Winer,10/30/16

2,The Nance,8,Theater Review: The Nance Makes Ideal Use of Nathan Lane,"For Beane, the play is a revelation that effects a rehabilitation. After writing the books of three fairly trite musicals, he has found a way to harness his love of camp and make it do something other than amuse with diminishing returns. When The Nance is sharp, it's very sharp indeed. But it isn't perfect; Beane will go almost anywhere for a joke, even years into the future, and the storytelling gets woozy and frankly a bit lost whenever it leaves the central plot behind...But Lane, in the apotheosis of his sad clown routine, is sensational throughout. Rarely have his innate qualities of pathos and quacking cheer been put to better use; it's hard to decide whether Beane has given him a part he was born to play or he has given Beane a role he was born to write.",Vulture,Jesse Green,4/15/13

She's determined to pass as an urbane sophisticate no matter how much she's trembling underneath her chic dresses and silk robes. In this she's kin to Scarlett Johansson's unorthodox, tough Catherine a few blocks away in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof."" But Clarke lacks Johansson's feral stage charisma, let alone the dangerous chemistry between Holly and pretty much anyone who spins into her orbit that should make ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" more than a sentimental coming-of-age tale.",Bloomberg,Jeremy Gerard,3/20/13
2,Fish in the Dark,7,'Fish in the Dark': Broadway debut for Larry David's brain,"Larry David's first foray into Broadway comedy is like watching a weird -- but undeniably entertaining and, God help us all, even potentially transformative -- fusion of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" Borscht Belt comedy of the old school, long-form improv of the Chicago school, and the kind of black situational farce associated with Joe Orton or other radicals with dark, anarchic souls and a taste for shows commanding premium prices. Well, that, and ""Old Jews Telling Jokes""...To say that David looks new to the dramaturgical game ain't the half of it...So, David wrote a play that you actually could do without him (people will). And both he and the play go to some very funny places. Thanks to the plot being centered on a death in the family, and the ensuing fights over a Rolex watch and even an unexpected, illegitimate kid, the show has a life-affirming, or at least a death-cheating, quality...In its best moments, it feels as if David actually has succeeded in forming a new and potentially lucrative stand up-TV-Broadway fusion.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,2003/5/15

The range of emotions Moayed conveys over the course of the play is stunning, while Titizian is nightmarishly good as the murderous Hussein.

Melancholy tones of sorrow and regret saturate this highly personal and intensely felt musical play, which is set in Wallsend, the industrial town in the north of England where the singer-songwriter grew up. The somber book by John Logan and Brian Yorkey takes place in 2007, the year the historic shipyard closed and the town lost its purpose and identity. The lyrical language of Sting's mournful score gives poetic voice to the distressed shipbuilders, but depicting their story as a heroic allegory is regrettably alienating.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,10/23/14

This has the unexpected effect, however, not of vulgarizing but humanizing not only Daisy and Violet, but their entire ""odditorium"" family...Davie and Padgett simply couldn't be better...the synchronization of their movements is as remarkable as their exquisite vocal harmonization. Their performances are both symbiotic and beautifully individualized...Irrespective of any awkwardness that creeps into the plot-heavy storytelling, the flaws are never enough to take us out of the show's enveloping world or to compromise our investment in the fates of Violet and Daisy...even when it borders on kitsch, the music pulls you in. It's not a top-tier score but it's a very good one, melodic and memorable despite lyrics that can be a tad literal and emphatic...Side Show may never be a classic musical, but in this superb production it's a hypnotic spectacle that packs an emotional wallop.

Shapiro (""August: Osage County""), who is as good as it gets for shaking hilarity from family dysfunction...The best thing about the humor is that it's also unembellished and played without irony.

Sinclair, portrayed by the wonderfully self-assured Marin Mazzie, is one of the reasons to see Bullets Over Broadway, the new musical birthed by Woody Allen from his 1994 movie of the same title. The Broadway show makes a Sinclair-sized effort to persuade us of the value of early-20th-century songs shoehorned into a 1929 setting.

He has an imposing presence and highly theatrical spirit, but his diction stops the show in its tracks. O'Hara, one of the finest actresses working in musical theater today, delivers a fine, sympathetic performance as the staunch Anna, but it is hardly as captivating as her sexy Nellie.

Close, with her aristocratic take on Agnes, comes within inches of coming off as arch. That approach doesn't hurt the character. But Close's unintentional habit of tripping over Albee's dialogue doesn't help. Lithgow, meantime, is riveting every moment he's on stage -- which is a lot -- even when Tobias is silent.

And he smartly mimics the breakneck pace of Sorkin's film and TV projects, cramming Lee's large and sprawling story in a production that runs just over two and a half hours but seem to just fly by. Despite its infelicities, this ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is crackerjack entertainment.",The Wrap,Thom Geier,12/13/18

It's hard to like or care about the characters, who exist in two fundamentally off-putting registers: When they are up, they are rah-rah party kittens playing charades, and when they are down they are grizzly and miserable. We don't know what has happened to them, beyond a few blunt specifics like Ernest's abusiveness. It is hard what to deduce of Mrs. Conway's bizarrely inconsistent moods, or Kay's portents of doom, when both characters are given scant depth.

Mr. Sher and his leading players also investigate undercurrents of romance and physical attraction which were not evident in the original production...Sher enhances these undercurrents, and has his actors act on them...That this works so well--and adds an additional color to the tapestry of the show--is due in part to the acting. Ms. O'Hara seems to have been born to play musical theatre heroines like Anna, Nellie Forbush and Julie Jordan; if only people were still writing such roles. Her Anna is young and hot-blooded enough to respond to the emotion, although unable...to act on it.

If you want to watch a proudly old-school Broadway musical with the best snow effects ever (thank you, projection designer Aaron Rhyne), however, then no stress balls needed. Despite a closing curtain of narrative ambiguity, this lushly orchestrated, gently delightful musical, directed by Darko Tresnjak, takes the view that the famous daughter of the Romanovs did survive the massacre of the Russian imperial family at the hands of the Bolsheviks in 1918, and-having fallen in with a loveable conman and louche aristocrat-sets off for Paris to prove her identity to her surviving grandmother.",Daily Beast,Tim Teeman,4/24/17

(Last year's Tony winner ""Once"" was a notable exception.) Burrowing into the troubled hearts of its characters, it draws a cleareyed portrait of an America that's a far cry from the fantasyland of most commercial musicals. ""Hands on a Hardbody"" simply sings forth a story of endurance, hardship and the dimming American dream, which increasingly seems to hover on the distant horizon like some last-ditch motel whose neon lights are blinking out one by one.",New York Times,Charles Isherwood,3/21/13

But on the whole, it is far more dramatically charged and focused than the elaborate but undistinguished original production. This feels less like a revival than a revitalization, or a new musical altogether. Erivo credibly conveys Celie's 180-degree transformation in personality. The big-voiced Brooks burns with ferocity while slipping into moments of good humor. Hudson is fully authoritative and altogether fantastic in the diva role.

(The set designed by Chloe Lamford and lighting by Hugh Vanstone reminded me of watching politics unfold on TV, something we've all become all-too-accustomed to in the last several years.) But it is Metcalf, who seems to have become the exceptional director Joe Mantello's muse of late (she earned a Tony for their previous collaboration in Three Tall Women and they've announced their next collaboration will be Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?) who elevates this production with devastating take-downs of her her husband like, ""You know given the chance I will eclipse you.""

The shocker is that she can sing -- and when she belts the take-no-guff anthem ""Hell No!"" you want to shout back ""Hell yeah!"" ""The Color Purple: The Musical"" is far from perfect. Marsha Norman's adaptation of Alice Walker's novel takes tons of shortcuts, careening from scene to scene at full speed.

I felt the agony to my bones when Melissa realizes Andy has abandoned her...Dennehy, with his gruff mannerisms and scowl, is excellent in a role that is, in ways, the more complex. Andy proves partly responsible for Melissa's descent--yet the play can only stay on solid ground if Andy is ultimately likable. He pulls it off with authority.

So, fleetingly, did other elements: Megan Hilton's blond ditz, giving superbly wooden-chirpy line readings; Rob McClure's mousy, frantic understudy/stagehand; and Andrea Martin, going full zany and threatening a cheating lover with an ax.

1,A View from the Bridge,7,__ View From The Bridge_ Brings A Bloodbath To Broadway _ Review,"I have to admit I'm of two minds about Van Hove's A View From the Bridge. My 30-year-old critic self probably would have thrilled to the ballsiness of turning a naturalistic melodrama into a Greek tragedy. Doing so adds a layer of meaning the way the cover of Abbey Road added a layer of meaning to the Beatles mythology. But my older-critic self says, ""Leave the damned play alone."" Leave us to draw the connection from Eddie Carbone to Willie Loman (Death Of A Salesman) and Joe Keller (All My Sons) - men whose sense of their own manhood cannot survive the emasculating pressures of making it in America. In the end, Eddie impotently demands his ""respect"" - even though he's committed the ultimate crime of ratting out his countrymen to Immigration. Even sexual congress with Catherine would have been more forgivable than that. Eddie's tragedy, like Willy's and Joe's, is that he is no hero at all, but a victim not only of his own tortured desire (perhaps it's Rodolpho he really wants?) but of his inability to gain entree to that American Dream he's been sold on.",Deadline,Jeremy Gerard,2011/12/15

(It's also tauter - about 10 minutes shorter than it was in Washington.) Evoking a bucolic North Carolina of the 1920s and '40s, set designer Eugene Lee deploys a skeletal cabin on wheels as the visual centerpiece, in which the band, expertly conducted by Rob Berman, sits and strums Martin and Brickell's amiable tunes, albeit with some oddly-set lyrics.

1,Born Yesterday,7,Born Yesterday,"There are very few shows in which the set earns more applause than its top-billed TV stars, but the breezy Broadway revival of the 1946 comedy Born Yesterday is one of them. John Lee Beatty has designed a radiant art deco gem of a hotel suite with gilded fixtures, glimmering onyx woodwork, ruby-red upholstery, and satiny sapphire walls. Topped off by fat swirls of curlicue chalk-white molding, it is - just as playwright Garson Kanin dictated in his stage directions - 'a masterpiece of offensive good taste.' No wonder it trumps Robert Sean Leonard's entrance. And, a few minutes later, Jim Belushi's entrance. But after Nina Arianda slinks her way down the center staircase, curtsies clumsily, and storms back up the steps, the set doesn't seem quite as glossy. As bubble-headed bottle blonde Billie Dawn - a role that won Judy Holliday an Oscar in 1950 - Arianda is giving a performance that could be called breakout, though breakout somehow seems insufficient.",Entertainment Weekly,Melissa Rose Bernardo,4/27/11

But on the other side of things, through some imperfect alchemy of actor, director, and character, Dano's Austin can't take the heat. He's so recessive for so long that Lee has nothing much to push against. Shepard builds tension between the brothers scene by scene, but here, an Austin who bends, deflates, and dwindles so easily and so consistently starts to make the play feel repetitive rather than cumulative, a drone rather than a gradual ribcage-rattling crescendo. When Dano finally reaches Austin's key aria - in which he quietly tells Lee the grim, pathetic story of their alcoholic father's trip to Juarez to get all his teeth pulled by a backstreet dentist - he's at last in his melancholy element. But the road to get there has been long and frustratingly flat.",Vulture,Sara Holdren,1/24/19

And, like the play, it begins well and ends well, but sags in the middle. The real problem, it seems, is the inadequacy of Anton's soul-searching about his own guilt. Rees looks very much like someone who's going through hell, and he expresses it well in ""Fear."" But this morally shabby character hasn't got an ethical leg to stand on. Kander just can't help himself. Even in what may well be his darkest work, he writes beautiful romantic melodies.",Variety,Marilyn Stasio,4/23/15

That's because Mr. Kitt (music) and Mr. Yorkey (book and lyrics) never let us forget. Until the show's last quarter, when some shadows darken the bright emotional landscape, all the songs are pretty much interchangeable. Whether performed as solos or ensemble pieces, these numbers tend to percolate along, blithely and wonderingly, at the speed of circular thought. They also put to work every metaphor you've heard about the elements of fate, chance and choice that govern our lives...Taken separately, neither plot of ""If/Then"" is terribly compelling or distinctively drawn.

This ""Color Purple"" instead belongs to the virtually unknown British actress Cynthia Erivo, who as Celie gives one of those galvanizing, star-is-born performances of which Broadway dreams are made. She beautifully captures Celie's 40-year progression, from abused and meek daughter and wife to confident single woman and mother; and she turns musical numbers that might easily be overly cutesy (""Miss Celie's Pants"") or schmaltzy (""I'm Here"") into punch-in-the-gut anthems of self-discovery.

For those of us who watched Hudson in concert early in her career, this performance, which is vocally exquisite, shows the remarkable growth as an actress...But Hudson is not the performer who brings down the house...That work belongs to Cynthia Erivo, the British actress playing -- actually, inhabiting is the better word -- the role of Celie and who, better than the several other actresses I have seen play this role, captures not just the fullness of her pain but the stature of her resilience.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,2012/10/15
0,Sylvia,7,Theater Review: Annaleigh Ashford Is Sylvia__ Search-and-Rescue Dog,"Unfortunately, this fantastic comic challenge is a dramaturgical disaster.

At first her English is presented as an approximation of what a human might think a dog is thinking: Barks are rendered as ""Hey! Hey! Hey!"" and soulful stares as ""I want to sit near you."" Sometimes, wittily enough, Sylvia responds to Greg's philosophizing with deflections like, ""I wish I could contribute something here, but I just plain can't."" At other times, though, Sylvia speaks like a normal person, and the other characters talk to her in the expectation that she will understand them specifically and rationally. Is she becoming more human, as Ann Roth's witty canine-human crossbreed fashions, moving from a furry sweater and velour bodysuit to a black cocktail dress, seem to suggest? Then why does she switch back to the furry sweater later? I suppose this is all covered under a general talking-animal-comedy indemnification policy, but it does add to the ad hoc feeling of the play, as if it were built to stand for only the two hours it takes to perform and not a second longer. At the stroke of ten, no matter how many shout-outs to Shakespeare it has offered, and despite the lovely Cole Porter tune jammed in for no reason, it collapses instantaneously.",Vulture,Jesse Green,10/27/15

Director Doug Hughes understands that one of the things Akhtar is doing in Junk is riffing on the Shakespearean history play.

He drives the production much more explicitly than was the case in Chicago. Cera (""Arrested Development,"" ""Juno"") remains his minimalist self, his back stiff and his body constantly residing on the lines of various acute angles. Not all of his work lands as easily on the bigger stage -- to expand Cera is not necessarily to improve him -- but this still is a very smart, funny and painful take on Warren, a tricky character whom Cera turns into an inept but empathetic soul...Gevinson...does not find the technical demands of working in a big Broadway house easy.",Chicago Tribune,Chris Jones,9/19/13
